== Abstract  ==
<br>The lesson plan, The Power of Wind, provides the means of educating fourth-grade students on the topic of renewable wind energy. Enrolled in the Engineering 215 class at [http://humboldt.edu Humboldt State University], Team JTRM utilized the teachings of the class's instructor, [[User:Lonny|Lonny Grafman]], to design The Power of Wind. The [[Engr215]] class provided a structured design process for Team JTRM to follow. &nbsp;The team also worked for their client, the Redwood Coast Energy Authority ([[RCEA]]). The team worked throughout the Spring Semester of 2010 to complete the design project. &nbsp;Team JTRM completed and tested The Power of Wind lesson. The lesson is available to teachers at the RCEA in Eureka, California. &nbsp;<br>

== Client Background  ==

The RCEA is an organization working to develop programs within the community involving energy conservation and energy education.

<br> Mission Statement: 

“The Redwood Coast Energy Authority’s purpose is to develop and implement sustainable energy initiatives that reduce energy demand, increase energy efficiency, and advance use of clean, efficient and renewable resources available in the region.”

== Criteria  ==

Both Team JTRM and the client, worked to generate criteria for the design project. It was determined that the final solution to the design project had to meet all of the criteria. The criteria are weighted from 0-10, 0 being of least importance and 10 being of highest importance. Also shown in Table 1 is a description of every criterion.

== Description of Final Design  ==
      
The Power of Wind is a one hour lesson plan, shown in Figure 2, that is designed to educate fourth grade students
on the basics of wind power. The students learn about the basics of wind, how wind turbines operate, and how wind power transfers electricity. 
 

[[Image:Kitsmall.jpg|Thumb|Figure 2: The Power of Wind]] <br>F'''igure 2: The Power of Wind'''<br>

<br> The Power of Wind lesson has four sections: a lecture introducing wind power, student assembly of a mini wind turbine, student construction of origami wind spinners, and a vocabulary worksheet. <br> <br>
===Vocabulary Handout===
<br>
The instructor begins the lesson by giving out a vocabulary sheet, as seen in Figure 3, on the basic components of a windturbine along with other vocabulary terms related to wind energy. The instructor will refer to the lesson binder which containins a power point and printed materials for the content of the lesson.
<br>
[[Image:Handout1s.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 3: Vocabulary Handout]]
<br>
The instructor will also be supplied with the book Wind Energy Basics by Paul Gipe to provide additional supplementary information. <br>

===Wind Turbine Assembly===
<br>
Following the vocabulary introduction students will then work in groups to assemble mini wind turbines. Groups will follow printed step by step instructions along with an instructional video, seen below, to complete the activity.

<br>

===Wind Spinner Folding===
<br>
Following turbine assembly, students construct their own origami turbine blades from construction paper. Students use printed step by step instructions along with an instructional video, seen below, to complete the activity. The students will experiment with their modified blades by observing rotational velocity and measuring the power transfer of the generator.<br>

<br>

===Wind Spinner Experiment===
<br>
The instructor then connects three turbines in series modeling a wind farm as shown in Figure 4. The wind farm will be attached to a board that can flash lights or play music when the power supply is sufficient (1.2 volts). <br> [[Image:SpinFarm1small.jpg|thumb|right|wrap|Figure 4: Wind Spinner Farm]]


===Worksheets===
<br>      Lastly, the students are provided a take home worksheet designed to enhance their vocabulary and to reinforce observations made in class. These vocabulary words are wind power related, and are defined by the instructor.

== Testing Results  ==

Team JTRM tested the final design with one student named Sage. Sage successfully assembled a miniature wind turbine and constructed an origami wind spinner, shown in Figure 6. Sage also experimented by running the turbine while interchanging the plastic blades and the wind spinner. Using a voltage ohm meter and electric board, Sage made the inference that the plastic blades transferred more energy than the wind spinner did. 

Team JTRM believes that the testing showed that The Power of Wind lesson met the project criteria. There were no safety or durability issues during the testing. Sage also had fun while experimenting with The Power of Wind.
