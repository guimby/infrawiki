## upgrade belt system
## upgrade to more accurate stepper motors
## use intelligent systems to monitor print parameters
## Print underwater
## create a system to automatically add more filament
## use sensor to detect under or over extrusion 
## connect to internet to monitor prints
## use system to stop prints if they fail
## use dissolving printer
## use dissolving computer
## more intelligent slicing software
## connect slicing software to printer so it can improve g code based of print results
## print bat to emergency stop printer if needed
## print emergency protocol system
## use padders to pat the sides to make them smooth
## use cap mechanism to prevent excess extrusion
## self improving gcode to limit printer movement 
## Self leveling system for ease of setup
## Smaller filament distance from printer head source
