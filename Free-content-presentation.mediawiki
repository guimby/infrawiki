I made an impromptu presentation on free content at BarCampSydney3 - here are a few notes. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] <small>([[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]])</small> 09:22, 9 April 2008 (PDT)

Do you know your content isn't free? Berne convention means it's copyright by default. And people don't know.

Open licenses - [http://freedomdefined.org/Definition what makes a free license]. [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ CC example]

[[APDS]] - purpose, how it was made.

Problems: US fed sites with illegitimate copyright notices.

Why I made APDS, how we use it on Appropedia.

Free content to save the world - the experience of:
* [[Home biogas system (Philippine BioDigesters)]]
* [[Practical Action]] Technical Briefs - original content used with attribution, e.g. in the rainwater page
* [[GEM mosquito control]]

Linux documentation is very poor - wikis should be solving this. But 1 there's no clear, single Linux wiki. Most of the huge amount of content generated daily is '''not under an open license'''. If I've spent hours figuring out a problem - I won't spend more time chasing permissions. 

What to do?
* Add a CC mark
* Ask your forum to make all posts free (e.g. CC-by, CC-by-sa or PD)
