[http://www.opensourcebeehives.net/ The Open Source Beehives] project is a collaborative response to the threat faced by bee populations in industrialized nations around the world. The project proposes to design hives that can support bee colonies in a sustainable way, to monitor and track the health and behavior of a colony as it develops. Each hive contains an open source sensory kit, The Smart Citizen Kit (SCK), which can transmit to an open data platform: [http://www.smartcitizen.me Smartcitizen.me].

These sensor enhanced hive designs are open and freely available online, the data collected from each hive is published together with geolocations allowing for a further comparison and analysis of the hives.
