'''Orphanage tourism''' is the visiting of orphanages, usually with the intention of helping the [[children]] and making them happy. However, this has several problems, including the following:
* A child's right to privacy
* Reports show{{fact}} that short-term visits can harm a child's development and emotional wellbeing. Children need stability.
* Child protection policies. In cases where orphanages fail to check the backgrounds of visitors, children are open to mistreatment and abuse.
* Such programs and activities distract from other programs of greater benefit for the child - in particular, supporting family based care.

A better way to support vulnerable children and their families is through [[vocational training]] and other community-based initiative.
