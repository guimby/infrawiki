'''Reverse osmosis''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''RO''') is a [[water purification]] technology involving pumping water through a membrane under high pressure. 

It is [[energy]] intensive, especially when treating [[saline water]] (because it has to work against the osmotic pressure) and thus only suitable when other methods are not suitable - in particular:
* [[desalination]], where the only other common method, distillation is even more energy intensive,
* [[water recycling]], where the membrane provides an added layer of safety against [[pathogen]] breakthrough. 

Recycling of [[storm water]] is the less energy-intensive option, and has less safety concerns than recycling [[sewage]], but storm water is not available in a steady supply. Large storage units can be built, but these are somewhat expensive, and most significantly, will not help in an extended [[drought]] when water is needed most.

Small RO units sometimes operate as vending machines, or are used in [[water refill stations]], especially in parts of SE Asia, such as [[Bangkok]], and supply water at a much lower price than [[bottled water]]. If there is reason to suspect that the machines are not properly operated or maintained, extra caution should be taken, perhaps adding a [[water disinfection|disinfection]] step such as [[chlorine]] or [[bleach]].

==Dangers== 

Perforations in the membrane will lead to unsafe water output in the case of sewage or storm water treatment, or slightly saline, in the case of saline input. 

==Suggested projects==
How does reverse osmosis treatment of wastewater (water recycling) compare with [[microfiltration]]{{w|microfiltration}} in terms of:
*capital cost
*operating cost
*applicability to small scale settings
*applicability to large scale settings
*safety, i.e. effectiveness in removing pathogens. Both the microfiltration and the RO methods would presumably need to be supplemented with [[disinfection]], as free-floating smaller pathogens (viruses and small bacteria - note however that usually most pathogens are ''not'' free-floating) could pass through microfiltration, and imperfections are likely in the RO system.{{sp}}
