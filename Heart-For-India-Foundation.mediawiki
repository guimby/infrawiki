India is one of the poorest countries in the world, according to World Bank. It is estimated that half of the population will drop out of school by the age of 13. Only ten percent of people receive any formal job training. In 2012 it was estimated that 37 percent of India's 1.2 billion people fell below the international poverty line. The Indian Planning Commission places that poverty line at $1.25 a day.

==Girls Town 2==
Because of the dowry system in India many poor families resort to killing or abandoning their baby girls. The families know they will have to pay for the dowry, wedding, and then "lose" their daughter to the in-laws. It is customary for women to live and care for their husband's family. Girls Town 2 is home to 54 young girls.They are provided with an education, and opportunities to better themselves.
