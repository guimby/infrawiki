===Overview===

This page is based on Appropedia's stall at Frost & Sullivan's GIL Europe conference in London in spring 2011, but will very easily translate to any other conference.

Our presence at the conference was in four parts:
# A 30 minute keynote presentation
# A 10 minute interactive session in the middle of the presentation
# A stall in the conference hall
# Participation in conference sessions

A how-to guide for parts 1 to 3 is given on this page.

===Interactive session preparation===

<blockquote>
Appropedia Keynote Instructions: ''«Group Name»''<br><br>
# Make sure your laptop has internet access using the venue’s wifi access <br>
# Start your internet browser and go to www.appropedia.org<br>

# When you have typed in some answers, scroll down and click ‘Save’ to display your changes. After a few seconds your text will appear on the projection screens on stage, so be careful what you say!
# View the results of your work and feel free to go back and keep editing and saving changes.

* Individual user accounts and pages should be created in advance to match the number of groups participating
* Each group's page should be added to the syndication page for the interactive session
* Use the following data in a spreadsheet to mailmerge in to the instructions to staff above
