'''''Out of Poverty: What Works When Traditional Approaches Fail''''' is a book by [[Paul Polak]]

With 25 years of experience, Paul Polak debunks what he calls the "Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths": that we can donations will bring people out of poverty, that economic growth will solve poverty, and that big [[business]], will end poverty. 

Polak and IDE have championed a grassroots approach. Polak describes how opportunities dave been identified and how innovative, low-cost tools that have helped in lifting 17 million people out of poverty.
