'''Blueberries''' are fruiting plants of the genus ''Vaccinium'' (along with [[cranberries]] and [[bilberries]]). They have dark blue berries, and most species are native to [[North America]].

The plants are perennial, and grow well in colder climates. The berries are sold commercially, but due to yields and handling challenges, they tend to be a relatively expensive fruit.
