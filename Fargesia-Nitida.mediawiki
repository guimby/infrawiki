One of the more than 1000 species of [[bamboo]]. AKA Sinarundinaria Nitida. A small leaved bamboo with slim dark reddy-brown culms that grows to 4 metres in ideal conditions. A popular one with British gardens. Likes a little shade. Tends to lean over in layers. Note: All Fargesia/Sinarundinaria species fold up their leaves (lengthwise) in hot sun, and open them again when the sun goes in. This can be an aid when trying to identify species.
