== Why it matters ==

Biodiversity is the degree to which species vary throughout the environment. It is used as a measure of an [[ecosystem]]'s health. Biologists and ecologists who study biodiversity typically look for the number of species and the way in which species differ. They also study the distribution of biodiversity across the globe and trends that may be contributing to decreased biodiversity.

The period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity. Named the Holocene extinction, the reduction is caused primarily by human impacts, particularly habitat destruction. Conversely, biodiversity impacts human health in a number of ways, both positively and negatively. {{W|Biodiversity}}

== Wildlife garden ==

A wildlife garden (or wild garden) is an environment that is attractive to various forms of wildlife such as birds, amphibians, reptiles, insects, mammals and so on. A wildlife garden will usually contain a variety of habitats that have either been deliberately created by the gardener, or allowed to self-establish by minimising maintenance and intervention.

Many organic gardeners are sympathetic to the philosophy of wildlife gardening, and will usually try to incorporate some aspects of the wild garden into their own plots in order to both act as a means of biological pest control, as well as for its value in promoting biodiversity and generally benefitting the wider environment. {{W|Wildlife garden}}
