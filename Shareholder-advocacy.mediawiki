Shareholder advocacy leverages the power of stock ownership in publicly-traded companies to promote environmental, social, and governance change from within.

This advocacy can take the form of a dialogue between shareholders and the company or shareholders may file a resolution, which must follow guidelines set by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
