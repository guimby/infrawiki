=== Campaigns ===

[[wikipedia:SNUB]], Stop Norwich UrBanisation. SNUB have worked alongside many local residents in protesting heavily against the proposed Rackheath Eco-town ([[wikipedia:Rackheath Eco-town|Wikipedia]]), as they claim the plans are flawed and will lead to massive overdevelopment of the area.

== Initiatives by topic ==

=== Cycling activism === 

National Cycle Route 1 passes through Norwich, linking Beccles and Fakenham (and eventually Dover and the Shetland Islands). <ref>[[wikipedia:Norwich#Bicycle]]</ref>

Sustrans plans to build a bridge between the Riverside area and Whitlingham County Park as part of the Connect2 project from the National Lottery. The country park is currently disconnected from the main residential areas by the River Yare and River Wensum. <ref>[[wikipedia:Norwich#Proposed developments]]</ref>

=== Food activism ===

=== Sustainable transport activism ===

[[wikipedia:Norwich park and ride]]

Proposals in the Norwich Transport Strategy include limiting traffic on some roads, introducing five rapid bus links into the city, and creating a 'train-tram' link to the Rackheath ecotown. <ref>[[wikipedia:Norwich#Proposed developments]]</ref>

'''Waterways''': The River Yare is navigable from the sea at Great Yarmouth all the way to Trowse, south of the city. From there the River Wensum is navigable into Norwich up to New Mills, and is crossed by the Novi Sad Friendship Bridge. Scheduled trips through the city and out to the nearby The Broads are run by City Boats from outside Norwich Station and also Elm Hill. In June 2012, Norwich City Council gave the go-ahead to introduce punting on the River Wensum. <ref>[[wikipedia:Norwich#Water]]</ref>
