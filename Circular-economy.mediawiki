A '''circular economy''' is one which conserves inputs. Waste is minimized and resources are reused rather than being treated as waste after their initial use. The term is used to explain what is necessary to create a [[sustainable]] society - i.e. a redesign of how society and [[business]] operate.

The current economy is a linear system: resources are taken out of the ground, made into something and later thrown away. Only with a circular economy is sustainability possible.
