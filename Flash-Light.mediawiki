== '''Abstract / Project goals''' ==
[[File:DarkFlashLight.jpg|200px|right]]
Create a cheap and customizable light for anyone to make and use.  This is a much safer way to light dark areas then a gas lamp, which can start fires and releases harmful gasses.  By making a small and easily portable light it can be used in developing countries as wells as developed countries.  If a natural disaster causes the grid to go black or in an area where power is not consistent, a flash light helps light up a person's world.

=='''Background Information, what you need to know'''==

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)- Depending on the specs for the LEDs that are being used. The forward voltage and the current rating are the most important numbers to pull from the spec sheets.  

===Write down on a sheet of paper=== 
                                 FW (forward voltage of LED) = (For this example the forward voltage will be 2 volts)
                                 '''FW = 2 volts'''

                                 I_led (LED Current Rating) = (For this example the current will be .02 amps)
                                 '''I_led = .02 amps'''

                                 V_source (Voltage source, otherwise known as a Battery) = (For this example the battery had a potential of 9 volts )  
                                 '''V_source = 9 volts'''

===Choosing a resistor to meet the current requirement of the LEDs===
The forward voltages of the LEDs add together when they are connected in series.  This is important, because the configuration will determine what resistor or resistors to use to limit the current for the circuit.  The example circuit has 3 LEDs in series, with an identical branch in parallel this does not matter for this part.  Each LED has a forward voltage of 2 volts, so 6 volts will be dissipated across the LEDs, since they are in series.  Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and algebra, the volt is solved by finding the remaining voltage drop after the LEDs. This is found from taking the 9 voltage source and subtracting the voltage drop across the LEDs, which yields a value of 3 volts that will be the potential (voltage) across the resistor.  Using Ohms law, which is voltage equals current multiplied by resistance, this gives a value of 150 ohms for the example. 

                                 (Number of LEDs) * FW = V_drop (The voltage drop across the LEDs)
                                 3 LEDs * 2 volts/LED = V_drop
                                 '''V_drop = 6 volts''' 

                                 KVL (Kirchhoff's Voltage Law) -> The Sum of all the voltages equals zero
                                 V_source = V_drop + V_Resistor
                                 9 volts = 6 volts + V_Resistor
                                 '''V_Resistor = 3 volts'''                                   

                                 Ohm's Law -> V (Voltage) = I (Current) * R (Resistance)
                                 V_Resistor = I_led * Resistance
                                 3 volts = .02 * Resistance
                                 '''Resistance = 150 ohm's'''

== Conclusions -> Ramifications of Project - OSAT Flash light==

For under 5 dollars someone with little knowledge of circuits could build there own flash light from scratch.  This design allows for anyone to print a flashlight with limited materials.  A modified circuit could be created if more money needed to be cut from the budget of the builder (i.e. get rid of some of the LEDs and reduce the battery size).


===Alternate usage:=== 

*This flash light can be used on a bike or be a hand held light; current design is hand held.
