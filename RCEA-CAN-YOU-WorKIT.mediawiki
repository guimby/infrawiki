== '''How to Replicate the Kit'''  ==
 [[Image:cyw2.gif|thumb|left|upright=1.2|'''Figure 3:''' Making the Hand Crank]]
[[Image:cyw3.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.4|'''Figure 4:''' Taped Electrical Leads]]


Setting up this kit involves some preparation, but most of the setting up is done by the students. Required materials for one generator include: one DC hand drill, one and a half feet of 1/8” steel rod, one half foot piece of PVC pipe (any width), three feet of 18 gauge speaker wire, four alligator clips, electrical tape, and some way to label charges. 
[[Image:cyw101.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|'''Figure 5:'''Black to Negative(-)]]
[[Image:cyw100.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|'''Figure 6:'''Red to Positive(+)]]

Making the hand crank is the most labor intensive portion of the construction. The steel rod comes in three feet pieces, and must be cut to be used as a crank. Figure 3 shows the arm being cut with a dremel, but a hacksaw can be used instead. The steel rod must be bent with two right angles, giving the crank a moment arm. This process can go more smoothly by heating the rod, making it easier to bend. Bending can be done with any sort of vice clamp and force. Once the two bends have been made, the PVC pipe can slip onto the handle. It is important that the rod be cooled before the pipe is attached. Once the pipe is on the new crank arm, the straight end can be bent to secure the pipe and keep it from falling off. To reduce slipping, the end of the arm that goes in the drill can be given a flat edge for the drill to grip, as seen in Figure 7. 

Making the connection wires requires three feet of 18 gauge speaker wire, four alligator clips, and electrical tape (red for positive lead and black for negative leads). The ends of each length of wire needs the sheaths removed with wire cutters ¼ inch to ½ inch from the tip. Each wire lead needs to be twisted in the clockwise direction tightly and inserted into the alligator clips. With wire lead aligned into the alligator clip, the base of the clip needs to be clamped down creating a secure connection. After the secure connection is made a corresponding piece of electrical tape is wrapped around the base of the clip and tip of wire as shown in Figure 4. This is done to avoid electrical shorts and to identify positive or negative leads. 

The generator at this point is complete and functional and can be assembled with the previously listed instructions. The next stage of development is the labeling of the hardware. The positive and negative terminals can be identified by observing the battery labels, and where they go. Corresponding “ + ”and “ – ” signs are labeled on outside of drill on bottom of handle as shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.

== '''Results''' ==

When testing the hand crank generators three significant issues arose.  These issues were the strength of the material utilized for the hand crank, the length and angle of the hand cranks, and the incorporation of items to power without blowing the fuses or burning the wiring within.  

The first hand crank that was tested was a three foot steel rod that was composed of five angles.  The design of this rod was to allow the user the ability to use two hands while cranking the generator while another student held the drill.  During the testing of the rod it was realized that minute electrical generation was occurring due to the large spin radius.  The increased spin radius greatly decreased the amount of revolutions the user could generate in a given time.

The second hand crank that was tested was a metal coat hanger that was bent and inserted into the chuck jaws.  The coat hanger was the dimensions that we used to model our current hand cranks.  The coat hanger generated much more electricity, and required far less input from the user compared to the first hand crank.  The metal of coat hanger turned out to be too malleable to be used as the final hand crank material, while the hanger produced significant amounts of electricity the hanger bent and twisted too easily, which also created a loss of energy from the user to the drill.

The first item we attempted to power was a single LED light; the surge of electricity from the drill immediately burnt the internal wiring of the light.  At this point we began to monitor with volt meters the average output of the generator and the maximum surges we were witnessing.  We used this information to select the items we would include in the box.  We check the voltage the device requires from batteries and compare it to the average output of the drill.  We also used the average electrical outputs to determine how many generators in series it would take to power larger devices.
