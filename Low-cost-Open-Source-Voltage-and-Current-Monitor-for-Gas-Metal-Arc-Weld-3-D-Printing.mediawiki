==Abstract==
[[image:power-weld.jpg|right|300px]]
[[Arduino]] open-source microcontrollers are well known in sensor applications for scientific equipment
and for controlling [[RepRap]] 3-D printers. Recently low-cost open-source gas metal arc weld (GMAW)
RepRap 3-D printers have been developed. The entry-level welders used have minimal controls and
therefore lack any real-time measurement of welder voltage or current. The preliminary work on
process optimization of GMAW 3-D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to
measure welder current and voltage. This paper reports on the development of a low-cost open-source
power measurement sensor system based on Arduino architecture. The sensor system was designed,
built and tested with two entry-level MIG welders. The full bill of materials and open source designs
are provided. Voltage and current were measured while making step-wise adjustments to the manual
voltage setting on the welder. Three conditions were tested while welding with steel and aluminum wire
on steel substrates to assess the role of electrode material, shield gas and welding velocity. The results
showed that the open source sensor circuit performed as designed and could be constructed for <$100
in components representing a significant potential value through lateral scaling and replication in the 3-
D printing community.
