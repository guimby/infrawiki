The '''green knowledge ecosystem''' is the wealth of people, sites and services who have essential knowledge about sustainability, and who interact with each other - teaching, sharing, copying, adapting, and innovating.

This ecosystem includes blogs and forums, and any other platform which contain and share knowledge. Compatible [[open licenses]] enable the evolution and refinement of knowledge. 

This concept developed as part of the [[Coalition of the Willing]] project, which began with the Green Knowledge Trust as a key element. The Coalition concept has at its core the [[Green Knowledge Trust]] (Appropedia and other collaborative sites for sustainability knowledge sharing), with a proliferation of content on other platforms linking back and with with the GKT and among each other.
