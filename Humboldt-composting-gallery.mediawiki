===Composting Facility at Wes Green's in Arcata===
*'''Description:''' This is Arcata’s green waste compost dump
*'''Justification:''' Green waste materials may be dropped off here to continue the decomposition process so as to eventually be sold as usable nutrient rich compost.      
*'''Issues:''' The actual method of composting is quite simple as it naturally occurs with or without help.  Wes Green's appears to be tending to both active and passive compost heaps.  Active compost will decompose quicker and turn into nutrient rich soil sooner than will passive composting piles.  For more info see "notes."  
*'''Location:''' It is owned by Wes Green’s and is located on West End Road at their site within the Arcata city limit.
*'''Notes:''' Previously it was a business called North Coast Quality Compost and was located on Samoa Blvd, the Arcata Marsh, and later at St. Louis Road in Arcata.  NCQC handled all Arcata’s ‘green waste’ free of charge, but after some 15+ years, due to complex issues that can be perused via Arcata City Council minutes for January and February of 2006, available at the city manager’s office, NCQC lost their contract and the contract was awarded to Wes Green’s as a 'for fee only' green waste dump. The fee is $20 per year at the Arcata City Environmental Services Department or as a $1.20 per month assessment to an existing Arcata Garbage contract (Arcata Garbage is not part of Arcata city). This project is administrated by the ‘County Planning Area Waste Diversion Program’, not the city of Arcata.

===composter===
*'''Description:''' This is a home composting unit. It is used for making rich soil out of food scraps. The scraps break down in the composter and can then be used in gardens. Most people keep things like meat out of theircompost to avoid harmful bacterias and animals.  
*'''Justification:''' A composter is an [[appropriate technology]] because it is helping to keep loads to the land fill smaller, and it is a way for people to enrich their soil for gardens by themselves. This implementation meets my definition of AT, which is based off of Schumacher's-small, simple, cheap and non-violent. I would also add [[appropriate]] to the locale.
*'''Issues:''' IN WHAT WAYS DOES IT NOT MEET OUR (OR YOUR) DEFINITION OF AT.
*'''Location:'''7th street Arcata, CA
