'''Fruit scents''' are the fragrances that arise in numerous plants and do not necessarily come from fruits but from leaves or flowers which have strong fruity scents. These scents can be used in a number of ways, such as for the purposes of gardening or for the production of market items.

== Using fruit scents in the garden ==

When planning a scented garden, fruit scents can be a feature item. In particular, rely on leaves and herbs to provide the strongest fruit scents, as fruits themselves need to be in sufficient numbers and highly fragranced in order to provide fragrance to the human nose. In many cases, fruit scents can contribute to an edible scented garden, where the leaves, flowers and/or fruits are edible for humans.

Some examples of fruit-scented plants for a scented garden:

*Mock orange
*Walnut leaves are fruity scented
*Pelargoniums with lemon and orange scents
*Cedars with a blackcurrant fragrance; the Western red cedar has a pear scent
*''Rosa rubiginosa'' has an apple scent
*The giant fir (''Abies grandis'') has a grapefruit scent

Some examples of edible fruit-scented plants for a scented garden:

*Lemon verbena
*Lemon thyme
*[[Pineapple sage]] has a pineapple scent
*Lemon balm (not everyone likes its soapy scent)
*Bergamot has a spicy lemon scent
*Oranges
*[[Chamomile]] has an apple scent
*Apple-mint has a mixture of apple and mint scents

== Using fruit scents in the production of items ==

Fruit scents can be used to make perfumes, household freshening sprays, lotions/body wash and other body care products, cleaning products, insect repellents, sachets, drawer liners, [[potpourri]]s, wreaths, etc.

Food products can be made from some fruit scented plants, such as fruit salads, herb flavouring sachets/essences and candies made with edible scented herbs or flowers.

== Caution ==
Be aware that the fragrance of some fruits is unpleasant, either generally or to specific individuals.
