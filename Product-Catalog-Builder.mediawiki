'''Product Catalog Builder''' is a shareware tool for creating electronic '''catalog''' of products. This program can create an entry for each of products. It is possible to build a '''catalog''' of any size, or several '''catalogs''', if needed. 

This electronic catalog has a possibility to place an order immediately (provided there is an '''internet connection'''). Customers browse the '''catalog''', select products that they like and add them to their orders. Finally, the orders are sent per '''email'''. All necessary data is filled out automatically.

Catalogs can be exported to any popular '''format''', for example, to '''PDF''' or '''HTML'''. There is an opportunity to create reports, print price lists etc. Product Catalog Builder can import the database of products in some other application, like MS Excel or MS Accesss. The program offers settings for discounts, for bulk buyers, and so on.
