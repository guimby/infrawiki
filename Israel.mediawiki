It uses tactics such as non-violent direct action and lobbying to improve the quality of life for marginalized populations that live in the region, most notably the Bedouin of unrecognized villages in the Negev desert of southern Israel. Bustan is an active part of the Together Forum, and works in partnership with the Regional Council of Unrecognized Villages (RCUV).

=== Community energy ===

Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Solar power in Israel|Solar power in Israel]]: Solar technology in Israel has advanced to the point where it is almost cost-competitive with fossil fuels. The high annual incidence of sunshine in the Negev Desert has spurred an internationally renowned solar research and development industry. At the end of 2008, a feed-in tariff scheme was approved which has led to many residential and commercial solar energy power station projects. Israel's goal is to produce ten percent of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2020.
