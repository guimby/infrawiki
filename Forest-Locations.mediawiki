{{dortmund forest conflict header}}
Here are some FOREST LOCATIONS and details about them. We need to identify for the VIRTUAL FOREST CONFLICT project locations that are good to model in second life and also that show different aspects. The forests should all be Boreal forests.

They can be real places or fictional. BEST is real.

THIS WAS CHOSEN as our first modelling location for the WERSTAS prequel events.

It was a section of forest owned by Markus Petz and could be related to several conflicts. 

==Ukkomaalisiteen suomen metsä  -a foreigner's finnish forest.==

I came to Finland and had heard tell of the Northern landscapes betwixt the land of 10 000 lakes. I heard the music of Korppi klaani and in me it conjured up the idea of how the forest should actually be. This is a conflict when juxtaposed against the practical resource use of the forest as seen by those (Finnish? suomaaliset?). How is there a conflict in the cultural perceptions in my romantic and the cultural expectations of an old growth forest as expected of a suomi resident? 

I am also a biologist so have some awareness of how a forest actually is, rather than how its imagined to be. I have a personal pagan view point, as shaped by my religion of Wicca and my western imagining of it. So these have an impact too. The question of nationalism and acculturation comes in here.

So for example do you see waste woodland? Unproductive woodlands which needs treating some-way to be productive? Or a stand of timber ready for paper making?

Do I see it as a spiritual place with an energy in it? Is it welcoming or frightening? OR neutral?

How we see these perspectives will often shape culturally the object / s we will see in a place. (There is the tale of native Americans taking some French Europeans on a boat trip - during the boat trips many things were seen, after the trip the trip was related (told again what happened) by both the Europeans and the natives of the area. The Europeans replied with nothing was seen - it was all a wasteland to them. And the natives pointed out the food that could be eaten and the trees for building canoes).

So in the case of this OLD GROWTH forest:

I see a spruce and see it as a source of nostalgia at Xmass - the green tips not noticed before, that you see as a food source or even for making tea. I see it more as making firewood, so big trees are noticed and small bushes are not.

So here is a cultural difference - to me the forest is a harsh place (so wild and untamed) to be survived and this the use of the things, but to you the survival is a given so instead you look for secondary uses of the trees production (its part of your existence).

So here is a description of a forest (AN old growth forest as I imagine it - with purely physical characteristics). It related to location 1 that I own, an old growth forest, but I have not been to that actual forest.    

"So what is a an old growth forest

To me an old growth forest is one that has not been touched by the activities of man. So there are no paths through the forest, every so often there are glades (clearings in the forest) where an old tree has fallen down and the rotten logs are covered over with beetles and wood-lice . As time goes on many of them are covered over with moss and some lichen. There is much of this reindeer moss or lichen of a slightly stringy nature like  an  antimacassar  or doily hanging from the trees. In the forest are some streams where the trees have been blocked and so small ponds may have formed.

Ground cover is a carpet of needles and small sticks. There are many sticks with moss grown over them, so only a bit of lichened stick comes thru. The forest is not flat, but is very bumpy with up to 2m rises and falls where branches or tree trunks have fallen and then been grown over. So its quite difficult to walk thru. THere are low down branches, but not so many as the higher branches cut out some of the light they' live off. The branches may be at waist height so you cannot just walk thru, but have to go around, or climb over.


The forest is not silent for the sound of a woodpecker can be heard and also the occasional cry of a metsö or capercaile. The forest is not wet like a swamp, but its damp under the moss and lichen. The moss covers over much of the kalliot (rock outcrops that stick up) and there are commonly brown pine needles that have fallen off the pine trees. Some of these have been collected by ants that make anthills, The ant hills are not dominating all of the forest, but they are quite large maybe 1 and a half meters wide and upto a meter tall. But if you were to sit still you would see soon ants, or beetles or maybe flies buzzing through the forest.                 here are not so many birds. Time of day matters.

The forest is mostly still, if you still yourself and close your eyes you can feel the trees stretching away and joining together to make a one great forest - a huge life form as one. In the morning the forest is cold and the spirits of clearing suggest a that there is something hiding just around the corner. As the morning progresses and the sun begins to shine, any damp and dew dries away and the forest feels like there is something absent, not that its sleeping but like someone just left. As I walk thru the forest, I look out for hirvi, ilvis and poro. Now it depends if rain-clouds gather. As they come and the forest darkens there is a menace in the air and I feel an elemental force as thunder comes. 

As the wind picks up small needles fall off, and with heavy rain they fall out of the trees. As darkness comes its still raining and I feel if mythical animals are there, tontu and larger creatures like peikko stirring. I am not frightened, though I would want to keep away from them, they would be gentle creatures. At this crepuscular (dusk) time there are also wolves and foxes on the prowl after fowl.

If it was winter I would see their prints in the snow. If 'twas not raining or only raining lightly I would see bats flying and maybe owls too. Hunting smaller birds or flying squirrels or red squirrels. I know there are snakes, but I never see them, only occasionally broken shells on a rock. Similarly I may see shells of snails broken on a rock by a mistle thrush (kulorastas).

I know there are bears, but I think of them near a stream to catch fish. And near a cave for sleeping. Maura  setts may be around and badger shit too! Foxes I see  sleeping in a scraping they made, where its dry perhaps a few cubs. There are some ground birds and lizards they eat." Markus Petz

==Pyynikki Harju Puisto==

some of the Pyynikkin harju puisti metsä has some place. For sure its nearby and we have all visited some of it. There is a place there which 1.  is iron age, and another place 2. with rocks with a military site. 3. there is another place there that has had some kind of survival camp impression

==Hervanta==

Hervanassa - new build of a new suburb. Brigit pulko.
We have pics and some sound files.

==Varasniemi==

"Walking and Talking in the Woods : Nopiming Provincial Park 

Nopiming Provincial Park is one of Manitoba’s 81 provincial parks and lies at the heart of the Canadian boreal forest. It is almost 1500 km2 and consists of a mixture of aspen, birch, white and black spruce, jack pine and tamarack. The area is relatively flat and low-lying with a myriad of lakes, ponds and rivers. Rock is also an important element in the landscape as demonstrated by the exposed ridges, cliffs and shorelines of Precambrian rock that were scoured 10 000 years ago by the last glaciers.

Cree and Anishinabe (Saulteaux/Ojibway) First Nations have been present in the area for 8000 years, but since the 19th century the area has been inhabited mainly by Anishinabe people and Nopiming means “entrance to the wilderness” in their language. In the early 20th century mining and forestry development occurred and this industrial use of the area changed both Aboriginal lifestyles and the landscape. Although only briefly, the area was one of the most active mining areas in the province in the early 1900s when gold and silver were discovered, and today there are still mining operations within park boundaries. In the 1920s a pulp mill was established at Pine Falls, just south of the park and a century long tradition of forest use was created.

In the early 20th century natural resources were controlled by the federal government of Canada. Under this regime the mill was initially allotted a timber berth (a large area of forest with harvesting rights) where the Manitoba Paper Company was to secure a wood supply for 25 years. When all the trees had been harvested they would simply be given another timber berth to cut. In 1930 the federal government transferred the legal responsibility for resource management to the provinces. Manitoba continued the timber berth system and, in what amounted to a ‘cut and run’ mentality, there were no trees planted in the region until the late 1970s.

In 1979 the Province of Manitoba and Abitibi-Price signed Forest Management License 01, an evergreen contract (to be perpetually renewed so long as the company respected its obligations) for an area of approximately 900 000 hectares. Abitibi-Price, having bought the mill and harvesting rights from the Manitoba Paper Company, now had the right of first refusal for every tree cut on the license area and a legal responsibility to replant the areas they harvested.

However, in 1994 the mill employees bought the mill from Abitibi-Price at a time when the company was facing difficulties. The newly formed Pine Falls Paper Company quickly became profitable and by 1998 it attracted the attention of Tembec, another company that had originated when the employees of a mill in Temiscaming, Quebec bought their mill after it had been closed. In 2004 Tembec chose to undergo certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and became the first industrial forest company in Canada to be certified. This type of certification is frequently explained as the result of a company’s increasing environmental awareness or by its desire to break into new markets. Therefore, certification is reliant on the media. Companies, like Tembec use certification and various types of media to construct an image of themselves and the forest to reach consumers. But certification can also be interpreted the other way around, with the environmental organizations using the media to (de)construct images of companies and forests virtually and influence the desires of consumers.

In 2005 a local bear outfitter sued Tembec over two clearcuts1 they had made on Shoe Lake. The outfitter feared that these cuts would damage his business and Tembec acknowledged that they had not followed provincial regulations on the cut. The Crown rejected the charges for Shoe Lake, but in 2006 they charged Tembec for a clearcut on Euclid Lake and Tembec was given the maximum allowable fine of just over $10 000 (approximately 7 600 €) for violating its work permit. Around this time there was also a growing concern over environmental issues in the province. The ‘green’ movement which had been building momentum over the previous decades suddenly seemed to be more prevalent and more powerful. The Western Canada Wilderness Committee, along with other environmental groups and private citizens, led a very successful media campaign against logging in provincial parks which resulted in the removal of commercial logging in all provincial parks except one in the spring of 2009, where it was deemed that the entire local economy would collapse if logging were removed from the park.

In the autumn of 2009 another event was highly publicized in local and provincial media. Tembec locked out its employees at the mill in Pine Falls when their contract expired and the two parties failed to reach a new agreement. Then the company announced that it was selling the mill or, if no suitable buyer could be found, they would close it. Tembec is currently reviewing offers, but many of the mill workers have left the area to find work elsewhere. Through all of these recent conflicts the media has unquestionably played a large role in creating a virtual forest for the public.

The video you are about to watch takes place in Nopiming Provincial Park. The participants are not actors, but real people facing some of the very real challenges associated with forest use, management and conflicts. A combination of commented walks and thematic interviews have been conducted during the project, and follow-up interviews will also be conducted in the near future. However, due to the fact that the project is on-going and not all of the commented walks have been carried out, this video is limited to those taken with representatives from Tembec, the Western Canada Wilderness Committee and two local outfitters. These four participants have used various forms of media (press releases, brochures, interviews, the Internet etc) on a regular basis to influence the public’s conceptions of forest use during recent conflicts in Nopiming.

Since this video does not include footage from First Nations people, government officials, cottage owners or other tourists, it is in no way conclusive and should not be interpreted as representative of the entire situation. It is simply intended to begin creating dialogue about forest use, management and conflicts. In editing this video into the three main sections, the first on logging/clearcutting in the province, the second on protests and the media, and the third on legal issues, it has been my intention to share with you some of the things that these people have shared with me. I only ask that you think carefully about what it is that each of these people says, about your own personal use of forests and how the two are connected through personal and societal experiences, whether they occur in the physical or virtual forest.

Thank you,

Matthew Sawatzky
