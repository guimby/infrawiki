==Introduction==
The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant processes the [[Arcata_Marsh_Compost#Biosolids|biosolids]]  from the [[Arcata_Marsh_Digester|digester]] into [[compost]] at its onsite composting facility.  The finished compost is used as a soil amendment by the City of Arcata Parks and Recreation department throughout Arcata city parks. <ref name="AWWTP correspondance">Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant.

==Compost Ingredients==

===Biosolids===

Biosolids are the solid [[organic matter]] produced from [[wastewater treatment]] facilities.  Although historically called “sludge,” biosolids differ in respect to the fact that sludge refers to untreated, raw sewage, whereas biosolid refers to the beneficial by-product of sewage treatment that can be used in composting.  <ref name="Biosolid Compost">EPA Report: Biosolids Use, Generation,and Disposal in the United States. Accessed 
online 4/20/08. http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/compost/biosolid.pdf</ref> The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant processes its sludge into [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/organics/Biosolids// Class A- Exceptional Quality biosolid].<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/>  The biosolid is pumped from the [[:Arcata_Marsh_Digester|digester]] onto covered outdoor drying beds (Figure 2), and left to air dry for up to six months.  The two drying beds are rectangular in shape, four feet deep, and use one center drain.  Dewatering is necessary in order to reduce the liquid content and increase the solids concentration to greater than 20 percent.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/>   By converting the liquid biosolid into a damp “cake” it can easily be moved into the composting facility.

===Bulking Agent ===
In order for composting of the biosolid to take place, a bulking agent is added to allow for aeration, porosity, and proper carbon to nitrogen nutrient balance. <ref name="Biosolid Compost Conditions">Decision Makers guide to Integrated Waste: Chapter 7, compost. Accessed online 4/20/08. http://www.epa.gov/garbage/dmg2/chapter7.pdf </ref>  The composting facility uses wood chips, grass clippings, and hydrocotyl from the oxidation ponds to provide this function. Operators mix a 3:1 volume ratio of woodchips to biosolids in a double auger vertical mixing wagon (Figure 3) and dump the mixture into long, six to eight feet high compost piles.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/>

=='''Composting Process'''==

===Active Process===
The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes an [http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/composting/static.htm Aerated Static Pile] composting process (Figure 4).  The "static", or unturned compost piles utilize an air supply hooked up to a pipe that is located at the bottom of the pile.  The pipe runs through the entire length of the pile and maintains the constant oxygen supply necessary for aerobic activity. <ref name="Davis">Davis, Mackenzie, and Susan Masten. Principles of Environmental Engineering and Science. McGraw Hill:   New York, NY  2004. </ref> During active composting, microorganisms break down the organic material in the biosolids.   As a result, [[carbon dioxide]], water, compost, and [[heat]] are produced.  The composting facility follows the EPA requirements for biosolid compost, performing daily checks to ensure the pile reaches 150 degrees Fahrenheit for three consecutive days, followed by ten days at 135 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/>  The high temperatures allow for pathogen and [[fecal coliform]] elimination or reduction. A pH level of 6 to 8, and a moisture content of 50 to 60% of total weight are also considered ideal conditions. <ref name="Biosolid Compost Conditions">Decision Makers guide to Integrated Waste: Chapter 7, compost. Accessed online 4/20/08. http://www.epa.gov/garbage/dmg2/chapter7.pdf </ref>  The active process takes about one month to for microorganisms to turn the biosolid and wood chips mix into a stabilized product.

===Curing===
After the month long active composting process, the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant cures its compost piles for an additional 30 days.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/>   During curing, the compost mix is stabilized as microbial activity decreases and the pile cools. Operators take eight samples from different locations of the pile and bring them to a lab to test for fecal coliform and trace metal contents.  If the compost mixture has passes inspections for EPA standards, it is taken by the City of Arcata Parks and Recreation Department.  The City of Arcata brings the compost directly to site locations, or store it by Health Sport, an Arcata community center.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/> 

==Public Use==
The compost is used exclusively by the City of Arcata Parks and Recreation department and is not available for sale.  Presently, the composting facility does not produce enough compost to supply the City Parks department and the general public.<ref name="AWWTP correspondance"/> The final compost product, however, satisfies the EPA requirements for a Class A biosolid, and can therefore be used in household gardens without any regulations.<ref name="Biosolid Technology">EPA:Biosolids Technology Fact Sheet.
