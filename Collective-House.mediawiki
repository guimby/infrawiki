A Collective House is about shared living:

* it is neither a [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#C|commune]], [[co-housing]], nor a co-rental place but a type of loose [[intentional community]]
* it is a creative response to extremely high urban real estate prices and monthly rental fees
* it keeps rents low and cost of living low while increasing sense of community
* it is a return to normal tribal way of living (before modern nuclear and partial-nuclear family living)
* it is usually composed of interesting housemates doing very interesting projects
* it is not suitable for those who just want to save money; the community aspect is essential.

==Ways to start or join a Collective House==
* gather a group; do some visioning ~ 3 month, craigslist potential housemates, more visioning, and let things coalesce
* to find available spots in collective houses:  craigslist keyword "collective" in the "housing" section

==Typical Rules==
* every one has to participate in household chores (it keeps the place democratic)
* rules are kept to a bare minimum and reviewed regularly for appropriate tweaking
* establishing mission statements and common lifestyle goals is good (some do) but optional (some don't)
* long term commitments, although good, are not mandatory nor enforced
* one of the biggest collective decisions to make is to pick a foodstyle for shared meals
* many houses end up choosing Vegan as the foodstyle all can agree to live with (housemates can supplement privately)
* many houses agree on some degree of [[kitchen permaculture]] 
* it is important to accept that sometimes a housemate leaves and a new one come in
* it is important to accept that some housemates are "deep cleaners" and others not (must enforce only agreed minimum cleaning requirements)
