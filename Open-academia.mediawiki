== 5 pillars of open academia ==

These pillars can be seen as the support for an open learning community to replace a closed "ivory tower".

The pillars are:
* [[open access]]
* [[open standards]] (including open document formats)
* [[open licensing]] - open to be shared and adapted
* [[open management]] - open and transparent governance
* [[open source software]] (or "free software," the free referring to [[software freedoms]])

An "open academic" is therefore one who supports these five pillars, in practice.
