==Abstract==
This page is intended to be used as a resource for selecting building energy modeling software solutions.  Most software packages perform very specific tasks, suggesting that a number of different packages be used to obtain accurate results for a desired project.  Not all software packages are free of charge, but often demos may be obtained.  Please refer to each package's corresponding link for more information.  

==Software Comparison==
The following chart compares a number of available software packages.  Open source packages are noted under the cost column.

''Note: A '''*''' means that the program has support for the import of external CAD data.  The required file format is also given.''

| $420, cheaper school licences are available 
| 1D-HAM is a piece of software which solves one dimensional coupled heat, air and moisture transport problems in a multi-layered porous wall.
| The program is based on the finite difference technique and moisture is assumed to be transferred by diffusion and convection in the vapour phase.  Furthermore, it is assumed that no liquid water transport occurs and that heat is transferred via conduction, convection and latent heat.  Climatic data can be inputted through a data file (maximum resolution of values/hour/year).  Surface solar radiation absorption is also accounted for.  
| The program can output user defined charts and text output of temperatures, relative humidities and moisture content.  The data can be presented in either SI units or in BTU.
| Building geometries are constructed internally within the program.  It is not possible to directly import geometry data generated by other CAD programs, meaning that LIDAR data would have to be reconstructed within the program.

|Free of charge
| 3E Plus is an energy management tool designed to simplify the task of determining how much insulation is necessary to use less energy, reduce plant emissions and improve process efficiency.
| The software analyzes input data including base metal type, various process and operating temperatures, wind speed, pipe size, surface geometry, fuel type, annual operation hours and the type of insulation.  
| The provided report tells the user how much insulation is necessary in the form of a preformatted report.  This report can be exported to a spreadsheet.  The output provides valuable information for insulation requirements of pipes, ducts, tanks and boilers.
| 3E Plus relates specifically to insulation levels.  Therefore, LIDAR data is not directly applicable to the program.  However, using the data combined with a building blueprint, the required input parameters could be determined.

</ref>
|$50 from the American Architectural Manufactures Association
| AAMASKY is a software package which analyzes component and total heating, cooling and lighting energy consumption in relation to skylights.  It can also provide hourly and monthly pattern of illumination levels for daylighting.
| By inputting parameters including commercial building design and lighting requirements (including area, skylight area and properties, occupancy schedule, geographical location), the software is able to inform the user of optimal skylight designs.
| The program provides guidance for optimal skylight selection, annual heating, annual cooling, lighting energy requirements and monthly/hourly plots of daylight levels.   
| AAMASKY only requires basic information about the building structure.  Other requirements can be obtained without input from additional LIDAR data.

</ref>
| $495, with discounts available for government agencies and non-profit organizations
| TREAT allows users to calculate energy savings for individual improvements or assemble improvements interactively.  The software includes a building component library and automatically calculates payback and SIR.
| The software integrates fuel bill analysis, weather data and building modelling information into a single database.  The program includes room-by-room heat loss analysis using an hourly energy consumption model.  User may also calculate existing electrical energy consumption resulting from appliances and lighting and select replacements (Energy Star lighting and appliances are included in the component libraries).
| Lifestyle savings (resulting from recommended changes in occupant behaviour), building energy model, suggested improvements, energy savings from retrofit. 
| TREAT utilizes its own component database in order to construct building geometry, suggesting that LIDAR data would need to be modeled separately, within the program.

| AIRPAK is a powerful airflow modeling tool.  It allows the user to accurately model airflow, heat transfer, contaminant transport and thermal comfort in a given ventilation system.  It is best suited for use in ventilation system redesign situations.  
| Models can be constructed using AIRPAKâ€™s building tools or with imported CAD drawings.  Inputs include ventilation system design (types, flowrates, temperatures, locations of air inlet diffusers and exhausts), thermal boundary conditions (from heating loads such as occupants, lighting, equipment, solar loads), humidity and contaminant boundary conditions.
| Colour animations, pictures, and plots of ventilation airflows depicting airflow patterns, air turbulence, room air distribution, temperature distribution, thermal comfort conditions and contaminant distribution.
