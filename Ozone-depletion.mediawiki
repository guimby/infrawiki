=Ozone depletion=

'''Ozone depletion''' describes two distinct, but related observations: 
 * a slow, steady decline of about 4 percent per decade in the total amount of ozone in Earth's stratosphere since around 1980; and 
 * a much larger, but seasonal, decrease in stratospheric ozone over Earth's polar regions during the same period.  

Ozone layer thinning is mainly caused by the [[CFC]] family, (Chlorofluorocarbons), commonly known as freons. These compounds are transported into the stratosphere after being emitted at the surface. Both ozone depletion mechanisms strengthened as emissions of CFC's and halons increased.
