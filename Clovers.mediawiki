'''Clovers''' are beautiful, they [[nitrogen fixing|fix nitrogen]], they are a great [[green manure]], and some people make tea out of them. Some clovers are beautifully fragrant, and attract [[bee]]s. The [[honey]] made from clover is mild and light in color generally. Clover can be used to feed animals, though only when fresh. There are many varieties, including some new ornamental types which are used by florists in some locations.

Children can make necklaces out of the small white or pink types. You tie a knot in the stem, then feed the stem of another flower through, and so on.
