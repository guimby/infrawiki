One of the more than 1000 species of [[bamboo]].  A famous species, quite common, known for it shiny jet-black culms. Quite stunning when seen in large mature stands. Can withstand hot sunny position and is very vigourous. Small leaves, as with most Phyllostachys species, growing to 5 metres in the wild.
