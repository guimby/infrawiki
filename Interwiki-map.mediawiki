The '''InterWiki map''' charts interwiki link prefixes. If you wish to propose a new prefix, please do so on the [[Talk:Interwiki map|talk page]]. Remember to specify why the prefix would be useful on a significant number of pages on Appropedia projects. 

Editing administrators should remember that the prefix (first column) cannot contain spaces ( ), colons (:), ampersands (&), or equal signs (=). They should not be two letters, to avoid likely conflict with languages (en:, fr:, etc). Unlike the first column suggests, none of the letters in the prefixes are case sensitive. The second column need to follow the established format, specifically <nowiki>"http://example.com/$1"</nowiki>

== Updates ==

If you wish to have a wiki added to this map, please leave a note on the {{talk page}}. It may be some weeks or months before it is manually added, due to our large to-do list, but we will respond.

(There was a script which updated the map daily, but it seemed to be causing the map to break regularly. We've now disabled it, as the map was rarely being updated anyway.)

<s>A script copies the list below into the database regularly - it is set to run daily at 9PM PST{{w|Pacific Standard Time}} (5AM UTC{{w|Coordinated Universal Time}}). So if you want to see if your changes worked, check them after that time. </s>

== Checking if the map is working ==

The following links should all be blue, and link directly to external wikis. If they are redlinks, then the interwiki map is currently broken.

* [[wikipedia:Project:WikiProject International development]] 
* [[Howtopedia:]] 
*[[TipThePlanet:]]
*[[Wikia:Water]]
*[[Greenlivingpedia:]]

Test new additions (after April 2010)

* [[WikiGender:]]
* [[w:]]

'''Note to anyone who understands wiki tech''': When were running the update script (see above) sometimes this map would break, and we don't know why. We've turned off the auto-update script. If you can help (so we can run the script again) please leave a note on the {{talk page}}.

=== Formatting issue ===

A space after the colon shouldn't matter - double-check this is the case: [[Greenlivingpedia: Green computing]] vs [[Greenlivingpedia:Green computing]]; [[Howtopedia: Foo]] vs [[Howtopedia:Foo]].

(It doesn't matter with local namespace links, e.g. [[Appropedia: About]] and [[Appropedia:About]].)


[[WikiIndex:|WikiIndex]] lists and categorizes many wikis.

[[CentralWikia:Society Gardens]]: A summary of active, established Wikia sites on serious topics (ie not entertainment or gaming).

== Appropedia endorsed interwiki links ==

'''Please do not change the format of this table,''' as the script depends on the format in order to update the database.

Notes 
# '''''mw:''' is used for the [[mw:|MediaWiki.org]] site, as "MediaWiki:" is a namespace within Appropedia (e.g. [[MediaWiki:Upload]]).''
# Fluwikie has not been added - the format required for wikilinks is different from other wikis (two parts of the title, separated by a period) and likely to lead to confusion. It's simpler to use regular external link format rather than an interwiki in this case.
# [[Ekopedia:]] links to the English site. Language prefixes should work for other languages: [[Ekopedia:fr:Accueil]].
# [[w:]] has been added for Wikipedia, for convenience in talk pages and edit summaries. For actual articles, [[Wikipedia:]] is strongly preferred for greater clarity. 
# Any listed Wikia project can be reached using <nowiki>[[Wikia:Projectname]]</nowiki> for the home page, and <nowiki>[[Wikia:Projectname:Article name]]</nowiki> for an article. [[CentralWikia:]] is used for www.wikia.com. [[Wikia:www]]

== Search engines (including site searches) ==
Notes: 
*PubMed is sometimes known as Medline. '''PubMed''' is used as the link in Appropedia. 
*For most (all?) search engines listed here, you '''should not''' use spaces in the search terms, but a plus sign instead. Or use a hyphen to specify that the words are adjoining. 
**This works for '''Google''', '''Scholar'''... (others not yet checked)
**With Pubmed it makes no difference whether hyphen (minus signs) or plus signs are used - [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=helppubmed.section.pubmedhelp.Searching_PubMed#pubmedhelp.Searching_for_a_phra Searching for a phrase] says quotes or hyphens are used for a phrase search, but they don't seem to make a difference in practice.)
*Note that Google Scholar is '''Scholar''', not GoogleScholar.
