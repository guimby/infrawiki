== Gravity fed drip irrigation, with the intent of complete, hands free automation.==

Welcome, you've arrived at the Global Goals clubs challenge WIKI. I ask you to see this as a starting point for entrants to the challenge of challenges. I ask you to help me prove to the world that if we use these goals as a guideline, a starting point in the search for simple answering to impossible realities. If each of you reading this works toward even one small answer, the millions of small steps could be enough to change the world. 

What follows is an example of a simple yet effective way to create an abundance of fresh vegetables in a small space with minimal resources. See it as a sort of "Vorarbeit" for the challenge. It's up to you to create a wiki about your entrant to the challenge and to get others to help you. My work is free to the world to copy. I used off the shelf products at a normal price, but which could easily be replaced with home made versions, preferably from recycled plastic. This is your challenge, to prove that the world can still be saved, if only we try. Find a way to mix cheap modern technology into the SDGs to answer as many of them as you can.

My personal challenge to you is to improve what I've begun and make it the answer I believe it to be.

''' The intelligent, low budget mix of garden with technology! 

Goal: To prove that by mixing fresh vegetables with science, recycled plastic, computers and computer networking, the poor starving people of the world can be fed at a minor cost, weighed against the benefit to mankind. The garden and ideas demonstrated here are in the public domain, free for anyone, anywhere to use. In exchange I only ask that you find a way to help in reaching the Global Goals and especially Zero Hunger by 2030!'''

'''Intro'''

Welcome to my garden! What began as an experiment, has turned into a working garden which can run alone for several weeks at a time using rain water. The garden presented is small scale, approx. 30 plants, but can easily be expanded simply by adding more branches from the above ground tank and filling it more often. It's main purpose was to eliminate the carrying of water, eliminate guess work and wasted water, while ensuring that the harvest is never at risk due to lack of water. The main benefit was that the automation worked so well that a 2 week vacation could be taken in the middle of the season. Only 3 things limit its effectiveness; drought, pump outage and overly dirty water.

'''Our greenhouse ''' 

20 Square meters, 4 x 5 
Not heated, so does freeze at night if it's cold

I've attended this garden of approximately 30 plants for 3 seasons. The 1st ran without filter and the daily battle with dirt clogging the drippers convinced me that a filter was needed. I created one out of sand and gravel, which made an incredible difference. This year I intend to improve the filter somewhat, otherwise won't make any changes from last year, other than exchanging dirt and changing plant location.

'''Parts List:'''

Originally I didn't want to include one, because it was too expensive and depends on what's available locally. Since we have no more water pressure than gravity gives us, it only needs to be water tight.  Here's a list of the parts that I used,  but hope to find (create) 3D printed and/or alternatives to reduce cost.

* 1 X 4000 liter underground tank (could be any size)
* 1 X pump (can be human/wind/solar or anything else powered)
* 1 X 100 liter above ground tank (again size unimportant)
* Hose - Enough to get the water out of the big tank and into the small one

** 1 X 30 liter tank with screw on top
** Gravel
** Small stones 
** Sand
* About a million connectors of all makes and models


'''Description of set up'''

Rain water is collected underground. A pump attached to a timer runs at a specified time each day to fill an above ground tank. The fill level is measured using a standard toilet floater to shut off the pump when the tank is full.

The water in the tank is fed from the bottom, through a sand + gravel filter to remove fine contamination. The filtered water runs through 1/2" tubing and a branch of 1/4" tubing with an adjustable dripper at the end runs to each plant.

[[Media:Drippers_with_cleaning.ogg| Drippers running, one slow, so it gets cleaned]]

The drippers are adjusted to provide approx 100ml of water per hour when the tank is full and will gradually decrease during the day as the tank empties. I estimate that each plant receives 2l water over a 24 hour period. At this time the tank is refilled, bringing the drip speed back to 100ml per hour. With time, dirt and/or algae collect on the dripper, decreasing output and must be cleaned away. I used an old toothbrush and opened the dripper to full open to flush dirt out of the tubing and dripper.

Grass cuttings are spread at the base of each plant as a mulch to keep the moisture in. 

'''Drip adjustment'''

To begin the season, a glass was placed under a dripper and left to run for 1 hour and adjusted until 100ml dripped per hour. All plants were set to the same drip rate and allowed to run. During the summer we experimented with more or less water per plant and although we found it difficult to always have the same drop rates, no plant showed too much or too little water symptoms, but no records were kept since it was mainly to ensure that the system would work as expected. In hot, sunny times much more water was released, but without sensors in the earth it's difficult to know what amount is correct. The system was never turned off, meaning it dripped 24 hours per day, but very slowly.

'''Plants:'''

16 Tomato
10 Paprika 
Various others including Eggplant, Cucumber, Green Beans, salad, herbs and spices. 

'''Big garden'''

Multiple basic gardens share the same water source for an economical way to feed entire villages.

'''Lessons learned'''

 - year 1 > 2

Without the filter, the drippers required cleaning every 2-3 days, eliminating all time savings. 

 - year 2 > 3

The filter worked well, but a dry spell left the underground tank empty, so that tap water had to be used. Shortly afterward the drippers began to clog and the top layer of sand was dirty when it was opened. The question is, did the filter stop working because the bottom of the tank was very dirty, or that the living filter was damaged by the tap water. Next question, does the filter live or is there too little oxygen? I hope I can answer those questions in the future.

 - year 3 > 4

It's difficult to find a cheap and easy way to seal a filter to take the full pressure of the 80 liter tank. Found a more permanent solution, but water always finds it's way through the seal. This problem remains unsolved!

 - year 4

The manual cleaning of drippers must be eliminated. It's the main drawback to this system. After four weeks they begin clogging and cleaning helps, but it's difficult to leave the system alone for more than a few days. 

I'd like to solve this by putting a tiny motor on top of a spike at the plant and let the drip fall onto the ends of 2 wires, the computer could read the short circuit as a drop, thus enable real automation by adjusting the pressure on the hose to regulate the drop count.


Conclusion of year 4 - The filter worked perfectly for 4 weeks, but the problem wasn't solved, so my search goes on. I have a new filter idea to try in the coming year. I'll be using the same tank, but as a "swirl filter"! I'll add pictures soon. The filter will again be placed after the above ground tank, my hope is that the slow moving water inside the filter will allow particles to fall to the bottom, while much cleaner water will go out the top. This should improve the ability for my drippers to run for a longer time without clogging! More coming soon!


'''My challenge to you!'''

This project is simple to recreate inexpensively, do it with as few parts as possible, and as many as possible made with recycled plastic! 
* A few examples
** eliminate the 4 corners!
** replace the 30 reducers and drippers with something recycled!, 
** change the mechanical dripper which easily clogs with a simple, inexpensive alternative
** how do you collect and store enough water to best get through the dry season in various climates?
** use your imagination!

Most importantly of all! It must be so simple, any child could run it. There must be at least 1000 ways, please help me find them.

You're welcome to take my simple, yet expensive version and put it to shame, by:
* simply find a solution that works better: 
** cheaply mass producible
** automate it, make the dripper clog free
** eliminate or improve the filter
** bring the price per plant to below $1.00
** keep it simple enough that even a child must use it

Where would I begin?
* An electrified dripper, could be a stepper motor or anything else. How about man made muscle?
** Stepper motors can be taken from outdated CD/DVD drives
* Networking, cables or IoT
* Computer, I'd begin with Rasp Pi, but cost and power must be considered.
** Linux because it's free and open
** Ubuntu Phone - Because it's Linux and needs apps badly.
* Recycled plastic, we must find a way to use what's choking our seas.
* Produce where jobs are needed most to allow multiple benefits from a single solution.
** If we can give the poor work and a way to feed their families we can stop them from leaving home.

== Future Plans, full automation - here's where I want your help.  Please fill in the blanks! ==
I've begun a list of the things which may seem impossible, but someone is already doing many of them.
Join in and see how it changes the world! We can reach the Global Goals if enough people take part in the search for answers.

I imagine this list as a place for school kids to find project ideas. Within the list there are an unlimited number of things which can be investigated, experimented with and refined. Take my idea a step further, change it to fit your needs, most importantly, document it to help others on the road toward Zero Hunger. Top priority is that you talk about it, let others know you're working toward the goals.

Please feel free to link yourself in here. Tell us about your project, we're searching for the same answers you are.

Please feel free to link your genius into this page ;-)

Keep your projects as simple as possible, a child should be able to use it. We'll need to include an intended audience selection, so each garden can be classified for searching. I encourage comments, because I really want my team to help me fix my problems. Tell your friends about my wiki and the GG club. We need all the help we can get! 

If you have an idea, but no team to back you up, you can count on me. Let me know and I'll find them. I can yell real loud! 

Please don't miss this chance to heal humanity before it's too late for us all!!!
