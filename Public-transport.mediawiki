'''Public transport''' (also '''public transportation''' or '''public transit''') is a shared passenger [[transportation]] service which is available for use by the general public. Some common public transport modes are buses, trains, and trams. These are distinct from modes such as [[bush aircraft]], [[taxicab]], [[car pooling]] or hired buses which are not shared by members of the public without private arrangement.

Most public [[transport]] runs to a scheduled timetable with the most frequent services running to a headway. [[Share taxi]] offers on-demand services in many parts of the world and some services will wait until the vehicle is full before it starts. [[Paratransit]] is sometimes used in areas of low-demand and for people who need a door-to-door service.<ref name=PT.org>http://www.publictransportation.org/aboutus/default.asp</ref>

== Vehicle types ==

Communal transportation vehicles include: [[cycle rickshaw]]s, auto rickshaws, subway, train, trolley, bus, monorail, folding city car (for point-to-point "cab"-trips only), [[skycab]]s, ... [[tramway]], [[metro]], [[TGV]], [[people mover]], [[funicular]], [[funitel cabin]]).

Design of appropriate vehicles to best serve the public in a given region is an important component of an attractive, functional system. Some examples of design of modern public transport vehicles in Europe, including several new light rail systems in major cities, is provided at the website of the firm [http://neerman.net/portfolio-veh.htm Neerman & Partners] managed by [[Johan Neerman]].

== Public Transport Planning ==

New research suggests that the key to an effective public transport network, that can provide a high level of service to a city's citizens, is the concept of [[Integrated Multimodal Network Planning]] - especially in conjunction with [[Public Transport Prioritisation]].

Also, an approach being explored to better fund improvements to public transport services, esp. in terms of extending light or heavy rail networks, is [[Land value capture]].

== Funding Approach ==

Multiple measures exist to fund public transport. Generally, it is based on a mixture of a direct user-pays system in terms of fares for travel, with some government funding from general taxation. There are also examples of using [[Land value capture]] to at least partially fund transport network improvements.

Some advocate for "free public transport" to the end-user (implying funding the system in other ways), however there is still an active debate amongst transport professionals and academics as to whether this is a good idea <ref name=wsDebate>http://worldstreets.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/to-support-the-tallinn-ftp-project-world-streets-readers-comment-on-free-public-transport/</ref>
.

== Information Systems ==

[[Information technology]] has had an important effect on public transport at the system level - both to potentially make the system more user-friendly using [[Smart phones]] via services such as dynamic timetable Apps, but also to support improved fleet operations and network planning. See the [[Transport informatics]] page for several relevant examples. Development of more widely-shared standards for multi-modal timetable data, such as the [[GTFS|General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)]], has had a significant impact in this respect.
