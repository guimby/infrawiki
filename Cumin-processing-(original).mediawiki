== Introduction ==
Cumin is a small annual herbaceous plant
(Cuminum cyminum) that is a member of the
parsley family (Umbelliferae). It is a native of the
Eastern Mediterranean countries and Upper Egypt,
but is now cultivated in Morocco, Iran, Turkey,
India, China and the Americas. The seeds of the
plant are used to add flavour to spicy dishes. They
are also used as an appetite stimulant and to ease
several stomach disorders.

This brief outlines the important steps that should
be taken pre-harvest and post-harvest to ensure that
the dried cumin is of top quality for the market.

== Types of cumin ==
There are two main types of cumin:

• White cumin seeds which are the most common type.

• Black cumin seeds that are popular in Iran. The seeds of black cumin are smaller and
have a sweeter aroma than the white seeds. They are sometimes confused with nigella,
another seed that is used in Indian cookery.
They both come from the Umbelliferae family of plants.

== Cumin production ==
Cumin is an annual herb that grows best in sunny climates with some rainfall (over 2000mm a
year). It can grow at elevations up to 1000m above sea level. The plants grow to about 25cm in
height. They should be planted at intervals of about 0.75m. The small white or pink flowers
grow in clusters on short stems, looking like small umbrellas.

== Harvesting ==
The seeds are harvested about 4 months after planting when the plant begins to wither and the
seeds change from dark green to a brown-yellow colour. The seed is small and boat shaped with
nine ridges along the length. The seeds are harvested by removing the whole plant from the
ground.

== Drying ==
The plants are dried in the sun or in the partial sun

== Threshing and winnowing ==
The cumin seeds are beaten out by threshing the dried plants with sticks. The seeds are then
further dried to 10% moisture content, either by placing on mats or trays in the sun or by using a
drier if the conditions are too humid. The dried seeds are winnowed using a traditional
winnowing basket to remove the dirt, dust, leaves and twigs.

== Grinding ==
Grinding can be a method of adding value to a product. However, it is not advisable to grind
spices. After grinding, spices are more vulnerable to spoilage. The flavour and aroma compounds
are not stable and will quickly disappear from ground products. The storage life of ground spices
is much less than for the whole spices. It is very difficult for the consumer to judge the quality
of a ground spice. It is also very easy for unscrupulous processors to contaminate the ground
spice by adding other material. Therefore most consumers, from wholesalers to individual
customers, prefer to buy whole spices.

== Packaging ==
Cumin seeds can be packaged in polythene bags of various sizes according to the market
demand. The bags should be sealed to prevent moisture entering. Sealing machines can be used
to seal the bags. Attractive labels should be applied to the products. The label needs to contain
all relevant product and legal information – the name of the product, brand name (if appropriate),
details of the manufacturer (name and address), date of manufacture, expiry date, weight of the
contents, added ingredients (if relevant) plus any other information that the country of origin and
of import may require (a barcode, producer code and packer code are all extra information that is
required in some countries to help trace the product back to its origin). See the Practical Action
Technical Brief on labelling for further information on labelling requirements.

== Storage ==
Dried cumin seeds must be stored in moisture-proof containers away from direct sunlight. The
stored seeds should be inspected regularly for signs of spoilage or moisture. If they have
absorbed moisture, they should be re-dried to a moisture content of 10%.
The storage room should be clean, dry, cool and free from pests. Mosquito netting should be
fitted on the windows to prevent pests and insects from entering the room. Strong smelling
foods, detergents and paints should not be stored in the same room as they will spoil the delicate
aroma and flavour of the cumin.

== Standards ==
The Indian standard for dried cumin is as follows:
