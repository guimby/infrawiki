==Abstract==
 Brake Calipers are an important component required to build a bicycle. In order to build a cheaper, open source, bicycle, the calipers can be printed and fitted with brake pads. Open source bicycles could reduce the cost of transportation for people that cannot afford to buy a commercial bicycle. This project can be combined with others to make a largely cheaper and printable bicycle.

== Bill of Materials==
(Makes Two Calipers)

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
(I do not currently have all the necessary materials so they will not all be shown here. I will update this in the future if I get a chance to actually implement it.)

 Print time = 3 hours per caliper. 6 hours total
[[File:Bicycle_Brake_Caliper_Print.jpg |||||500px]]
 Assembly time = approximately 15 minutes

# Remove parts from the print bed
# Attach the base of the calipers to the fork of the bicycle with bolts. 
# Use a washer on the far side before putting the nut on.
# Install brake pads into inward facing cylinders.
# Connect the cable guide receiver to the right caliper with a bolt.
# Put the cable guide into the receiver.
# Run a bolt backwards through the top of the left caliper.
# Add a washer and screw the nut most of the way on.
# Adjust the brakes so there is only a small clearance (~3mm) between the brake pads and the wheel wall.
# Wrap the brake cable around the bolt underneath the washer.
# Tighten the nut down to secure the brake cable.



=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Brake line comes loose
** Ensure that the bolts are still properly tightened every few weeks

== Cost savings==
* Total Cost (two calipers) = $19.60
** Commercial Component Cost = $17.31
** Plastic Cost - 99.4g (49.7 each) at $23/kg = $2.29

**$16-$40 each
**$32-$40 for two
*$12.4 - $20.4 savings for two calipers
*38.75% - 51% savings
