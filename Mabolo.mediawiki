If you have plenty of space available, Mabolo is an interesting option for the guerrilla gardener in tropical areas since:
* It is a fairly fast growing, large tree
* Female trees yield a lot of tasty fruit
* Once established, Mabolos require minimal care
* It is not fussy about soil types
* It provides high quality timber

Points to note are:
* Mabolos are dioecious{{w|Dioecious}}, so a lone tree will not fruit
* It takes at least 5 years to set fruit

==Planting==
Mabolo tolerates a wide variety of soils, but is not tolerant of waterlogged soil or of cold.

===Propagation===
Mabolos are dioecious{{w|Dioecious}}, so both males and females are needed to set fruit. I am unsure how long it takes to detect which gender a tree is.

Vegetative propogation and grafting are also possible, either to speed time to fruiting or for propogation of superior or seedless cultivars.
