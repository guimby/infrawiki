=== Sustainable transport activism ===

:[[wikipedia:Transportation_in_California#Current_issues|Transportation in California, Current issues]]: The California High Speed Rail Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 700 mile (1127 km) rail system. It would provide a TGV-style high-speed link between the state's four major metropolitan areas, and would allow travel between [[Los Angeles]]' Union Station and the [[San Francisco]] Transbay Terminal in two and a half hours. Voters approved Proposition 1A in November 2008, approving a $9 billion state bond to finance the project. Then in 2012, the California legislature and Governor Jerry Brown approved construction financing for an initial stage of the project. However, the High Speed Rail Authority still estimates that the initial stages will not be completed until 2021.
