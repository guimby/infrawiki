A recipe for Mastic from the 1881 Household Cyclopedia

* [[Sand]], 100 lbs.
* [[Producing stone dust|Marble dust]], 100 lbs.
* [[WikiPedia:Freestone|Freestone]], 100 lbs.
* [[Red lead]] (minium), 3 lbs.
* [[Litharge]], 3 lbs.
* [[Linseed oil]], 21 pints

Mastic is suitable for light duty use as a tile adhesive in occasionally wet areas.  More workable than thinset, especially on vertical surfaces.  Does not have the problem of water being sucked out of it instantly by wallboard, blueboard, greenboard, etc.

Not really suitable for modern applications due to the toxic lead.  Substitute ingrediants might be powdered oxides of zinc ???
