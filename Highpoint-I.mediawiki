The '''Highpoint I''' [[apartment]] building, built in England in 1935, is modern-looking, forward thinking for its time, and widely praised. 

== Shared spaces ==

The [[shared spaces]] did not work as planned. The plan for its foyer areas to function as a social forum never worked in practice. Neither was the roof terrace (an important element in [[Le Corbusier]]'s theory of modern architecture) furnished or greatly used, though it was originally intended to be.<ref>[http://www.architectureweek.com/2003/0409/culture_1-1.html Lubetkin's High Point] by John Allan, ''ArchitectureWeek''.

== Pricing out the workers ==

Though designed for workers, the quality of its design led to its apartments being sought after by the middle class.

This is similar to the experience of [[New Urbanist]] towns in more recent times, such as [[Seaside, Florida]]. When good design is a rare thing, it will inevitably be priced more highly - the only way to make good design available to the majority may be to make it ubiquitous.

== Designers ==

It was designed and built by Berthold Lubetkin{{w|Berthold Lubetkin}} and [[Ove Arup]].{{w|Ove Arup}} Arup expressed disappointment with the project, in hindsight.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ove_Arup#Highpoint_I]

Highpoint II was built in 1938.
