'''Compatible Technology International''' (CTI) is a nonprofit organization that alleviates [[hunger]]  and [[poverty]] in the developing world by designing and distributing simple, life-changing  food and water technologies. CTI was founded in 1981 by a group of missionaries,  research engineers, and General Mills food scientists. The team formed an  organization of skilled volunteers that would use its knowledge and expertise  to help the poor use simple tools and local resources to resolve their food  problems.

CTI’s  promotes [[food security]] by building and deploying devices that address the post  harvest side of the food chain. Many organizations  focus their efforts  on seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation for cultivating crops, but few   consider farmers’ post harvest needs. CTI’s devices help farmers process, store,  and sell their crops—improving nutrition and providing economic opportunities  for the rural poor.
