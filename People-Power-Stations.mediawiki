'''People Power Stations''' (PPS) are planned a sustainable social enterprises, currently at the demonstration project stage, that will bring affordable bikes to the [[BoP]] as part of a strategy to develop community access to [[money]], [[water]], [[electricity]], and [[sanitation]]. 

PPS will be shops where people pedal bicycles to power electric generators, pump water, thrash grain, etc, as needed. The pedalers earn a wage based on "kilowatt hours" of production, liters of water pumped, etc, and are paid in national money and/or an alternative currency.
