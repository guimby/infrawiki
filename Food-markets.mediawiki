Improving local '''food markets and networks''' is one of the keys to [[food security]]. This argument is spelled out in ''Towards Priority Actions for Market Development for African Farmers'', a book published in 2012 by the [[Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa]]. 

If farmers are better able to sell their crop, they will have greater incentives and greater cashflow for improving output.

Markes are not the only in overcoming food scarcity - [[farm productivity]] is also key, along with post-harvest facilities and [[credit]]. However, markets are often overlooked.
