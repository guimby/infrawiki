'''Appropriate development''' is a broadening of the concept of '''[[Appropriate technology]]''' - [[appropriateness]] to the context ([[culture]], [[economics]], and [[environment]]), of all manner of development. 

This includes [[international development]], the [[sustainable development]] of wealthier communities, and everything in between.

Crucial ingredients of appropriate development include [[empowerment]], [[community participation]], and an emphasis on the [[freedom]] of the intended beneficiaries. 

== Dangers to development ==

Avoiding [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#C|coercion]] and opportunities for [[corruption]] are essential, as these can severely cripple an aid or development program, sometimes even having an overall negative impact.

== Context ==

Sensitivity to [[culture and development|culture]] and [[gender and development|gender]], and appreciation of [[local knowledge]], are essential to appropriately designed and targeted programs.

Immerse yourself in the context - live in it and study it. Look for how [[incentives]] work, why people do what they do, and don't do something else. 

For example, people may be willing to make investments to build and maintain their own [[water]], [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] systems if they feel they will benefit from them, but if they do not have [[property rights]] (e.g. they are squatters or slum dwellers, without recognition for their status) then they will likely be unwilling to invest money and time.

== Eyes on the goal: development ==

Development projects must be seen as part of a longer process - i.e. development as the goal, rather than a specific project. for that reason, [[admitting failure]] and learning from it is essential. An appropriately humble attitude, recognizing that learning is a long process and that mistakes are part of that process, enables development workers avoid the problem of [[good intentions, disastrous outcomes]]. In particular, [[voluntourism]] is susceptible to naive expectations and approaches, and should be handled with care.

== Money and technology traps ==

Beware of thinking that more money or better technology is enough. 

Recognize that [[subsidies and grants]] can sometimes enable a project, but are very likely to negative side-effects - plan carefully, and weigh up ways to achieve outcomes apart from giving or spending money.

Recognize the importance of individuals in the process. A program is only as good as the people running it - for this reason, [[fund people, not concepts]].
 
A [[technological solution]] may or may not be effective in achieving the intended aims - it needs to truly be [[appropriate technology]], appropriate to the needs of the [[context]].
