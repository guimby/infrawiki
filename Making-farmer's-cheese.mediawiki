== Farmer's cheese ==
'''

This is a soft, home made cheese that is eaten fresh. It can be made from goat's milk or cow's milk. Keep everything very clean and use only freshly boiled cloth for straining.

'''Ingredients-'''

Two gallons (7.6 l) of milk (goat or cow)

½ of a Rennet tablet dissolved in 1/4 cup warmish water

1/4 cup of cultured buttermilk

'''Doing it-'''

1) Warm the milk to 68 to 70 F

2) Mix the buttermilk thoroughly with the warm milk

3) Stir in the Rennet solution very completely and let sit for 24 hours

4) When the curd is firm cut it into small cubes (½ inch).

5) Spoon the curds into a colander or strainer lined with a sterile cloth.

6) Make a bag of this cloth and hang in a refrigerator or other cool place

7) Allow the curds to drain for at least a day.

8) Add salt to taste and store refrigerated for no more than two weeks. This is not a keeping cheese.

This soft cheese can be the basis to make many other cheeses by using other cultures and varying the procedure.
