===Botanical Gardens, Bakau Gambia===

The medicinal garden was started around 2008. They currently have about 67 species, but it is expanding with a target for 100 species; all are indigenous to the area.

The Garden got started after Sam Sawaneh noticed the dwindling knowledge on traditional medicinal plants and their uses. These days its mainly the elders who use and have knowledge of the plants.

With this situation in mind, the future vision of the medicinal plant garden is to eventually be a resource and center for the community to buy and learn about medicinal plants.
