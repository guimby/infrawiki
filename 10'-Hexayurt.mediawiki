'''The H15 Hexayurt''' aka '''The 10' Hexayurt'''
<br />

<br /><br />
The H15 Hexayurt is like the standard 8' hexayurt, with the wall height increased by 2 feet to make more livable headroom [http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs642.snc4/60205_463122598071_546703071_6512076_6776629_n.jpg]. The lowest point is 6 feet tall, the peak of the roof is 10 feet. This makes your entryway a better size for the average person's height.  It requires 3 more panels than the 8' hexayurt (which requires 12 panels), and so it has been re-named the "H15."  It has also been called the '''Mark II,''' which sounds more inspiring than either other name. If you're interested in having better height at your entryway, but don't want to spend too much more money on panels, try the [[Hexayurt H13]], which is a trickier design but very elegant, especially if a portion of your living space is used for sleeping and doesn't require standing room.

Avobe: an H15 at Burning Man, ugly truck and bike shown included for scale. Notice that a couple of roof panels have logos showing (oops), but that the tape- hinges are all covered with 6" foil tape to make them last even after baking in the desert sun for many years of Burning Man.

<br />
Given a choice between the H13 and H15, the H15 is more structurally sound, given that your tape-ring is not cut into with the addition of the door, and it's symmetrical on all axes. The roof hinges are the same as the classic 8' hexayurt, each of the 6 wall panels have the 2' addition either hinged on, or taped on once you hit playa. 
<br /><br />
It would appear H15's have survived [http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs642.snc4/60205_463122598071_546703071_6512076_6776629_n.jpg at Burning Man], and were playa tested in the nasty 2012 winds. Even the H15's made with 1" thick panels stood solidly. FYI, Julie Danger camps in an H15 made with 1" thick panels...but really, 1.5 thick panels would be better for this increased height. For the ''best'' structural stability, you would stagger the 2' addition top and bottom when you build the walls, and it would still ship in the 4'x8' stack. However, that's a lot of extra on-playa work that no one is willing to do...if you can ship and store the yurt in a 6x8' stack, definitely stagger each wall section. If you're going to be lazy and make 4 pre-folded wall sections, be sure that your 2x8' wall additions are staggered (see PDF 'front and back view').

'''Follow this PDF''' the successfully playa tested H15, with 4 wall sections (most common version seen on-playa): [[http://www.appropedia.org/File:Danger_H15_Hexayurt_instructional_2013.pdf]]



consider this for tape requirements:
100 	feet total 3" bifil
but I'd skip ordering 3" for just 100 feet, maybe stick w/ 6" all the way

480 	feet total 6" bifil...
...but you'll need another 120 or so feet every time you put up the yurt


The one you'll need a lot of (and can get at homo depot) is the foil tape-- in 3" width:
356 	feet total 3" foil
for sealing the edges of the panels.

Then to "shade" the permanent Danger hinges, you'll need
210 	feet of 6" foil OR 420 of 3" foil tape!
