A dibber is a gardening tool used to create holes in the soil for placing seeds or seedlings into the ground with precision and ease. It is especially helpful for larger seeds, such as bean or pea seeds and for transplanting young seedlings. It can also be helpful for planting bulbs.

The dibber is also known as a dibbler, a dibb or a dibble.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibber</ref> In New Zealand, it is referred to as a mattock.<ref name="wp" />

Some dibbers come with soil depth markings printed or etched onto them, to assist with planting depth assessment.

== Types of dibber ==

The dibber comes in several variants:<ref name="wp" />

*Straight dibber: As the name implies, it is a straight tool. It will usually have a sharpened end. It could be as simple as a stick or as complicated as a carved piece of wood.
*T-handled dibber: This dibber has a bar across the top of the non-sharpened end that allows the holder to grasp and push it in with firmness.
*L-shaped dibber: Unlike the T-handled dibber, the handlebar across the top is offside to form an L-shape instead. The handle section may have finger holding grooves moulded into it if made from plastic. 
*Trowel dibber: This is a combination of a dibber with a trowel, each tool function at opposite ends of the whole tool.
