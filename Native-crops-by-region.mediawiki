== Why native crops ? ==
Native crops can be expected to fit the [[ecology]] of the region, and be able to grow in the [[climate]] and [[soil]] of the region. They can also play an important role in reducing the [[Food distribution|distance food needs to travel]]. <ref>Ie the farming of native crops/animals can be regulated nationally (so it can be made illegally to cultivate anything that is not native) and worldwide transport will no longer be economically feasible at all (as import/export of most crops depends on availability of several regions rather than just one region. having only one region from which crop can come will clog shipping/aircraft transport routes and/or the routes may not be economically attractive at all). This results in having the crop/animal not transported at all, and the consumer being force to choose another crop/animal. This will be, in most cases, a crop/animal that is grown on a better route, often closer to home.</ref> However, native crops may not always be as productive as the more popular domesticated counterparts or attain equally high prices. The latter is often a result of being not well known (and thus disliked) by the population (at least at first). 

Native crops should always be considered in [[agriculture]] as they are generally hardier and thus [[food security|safer crops]] in terms of providing food (especially today, with global warming affecting the precipitation pattern). They are however not the most appropriate choice in some situations. Especially where unwanted propagation, and contact to the outside environment can be reduced/eliminated (ie use in greenhouses, sterile crops, ...) non-indigenous crops may be a suitable option.

* Rapeseed is another important protein-crop which however has not been mentioned here. This as press cakes are consumable by humans<ref>KATHO in Roeselaere, Belgium makes pastes and energy bars from this for human consumption</ref> and as these contain a huge amount of protein. You can find rapeseed indicated at File:Oil_crops.png 
* Sugar beet wasn't included as it is a selected species from Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha Kombucha] not mentioned as it can be made anywhere without danger of introducing a exotic species to the area (uses a bacteria or yeast)
* Coca (for coca maté) and kava not mentioned neither, despite being a important local drink. This, as they're mostly mind-altering substances rather than true drinks (unlike yeasted beverages (containing ethanol), they can cause vomoting, ... even when consuming small amounts)
* Finally note that many beverages (ie lemonade, ...) require fruit juice (often from citrus such as lime or lemon). Refer to the Fruits and nuts map for this, not btw that these too have low caloric contents (other citrus crops have higher caloric contents)
