'''Categories''' - April 8, 2011

Another helpful tip for organizing your thesis compliments of Rob. Set up a subcategory to your thesis like this http://www.appropedia.org/Category:Rob_Andrews_Thesis
Make sure that it is this on the page - <nowiki>[[Category:Queens Applied Sustainability Group]]</nowiki> and then tag all of your lit reviews, protocols, sub-papers etc with your thesis tag.

This has two big advantages - 1) it keeps everything for your project nice,neat and ordered for anyone including yourself to keep track of - and 2) it helps brand your work a little bit more, which will be helpful for future employment.


'''Referencing''' - March 20, 2011

This is for everyone -- when referencing things numerically and when you ave several in a row - always group them -- instead of [1],[2],[3],[4] do this [1-4]. When you do your drafts even for a numbered journal - please keep it in parenthetical notation (Nosrat, 2011) until the very end -- then we can change it to [2].


'''DOIs''' - March 16, 2011

Something everyone should be doing - when you are posting links to articles - particularly for your lit reviews -- please use DOI links rather than the long and often broken straight links....this way it works before and after the article is put in press - like this I. Zelenika-Zovko and J. M. Pearce,  “Diverting Indirect Subsidies from the Nuclear Industry to the Photovoltaic Industry: Energy and Economic Returns”, Energy Policy (in press). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.02.031 but also if the site changes it will still get forwarded to the right place....


'''Thesis protocol''' - February 23, 2011 

Second, there is still some confusion on thesis writing. Everyone (grad students) is doing a manuscript based thesis from here on out. This means that:

#. First we break up your thesis into papers.
#. Then you need to write the papers First - with my help using the standard protocol here: http://www.appropedia.org/Queens_Applied_Sustainability_Research_Group_paper_writing
#. After the papers that make up the core of your thesis are submitted then you go back and write the chapters on your own using the papers as a base -- you give me paper hard copies when they are done and I will edit/attack them as a committee member not as a co-author. You can (and should) do this one chapter at time.
#. After I have taken a first pass at all chapters - then you give me a quick look at a completed thesis....after green light you send a completed packet to your committee- this should be about a month
before you want to defend 5. Then you defend - I will keep track of any changes that need to be made in your defense - and afterwards we will talk about it.
#. Lastly you make any revisions necessary, submit to me - after last green light you submit to the grad school....and you are done!


'''Webpage Update''' - February 16, 2011

Update the link next to your name on our main page discussing your project here: http://www.appropedia.org/Category:Queens_Applied_Sustainability_Group
Please do the following:
* make sure the link is going to your main project (and if you have others they should be listed there as well)
* link to relevant lit reviews, protocols, and other projects completed or going on (and make sure the lit review links back to your project)
* make sure that papers you have published are listed in the lit search - and that you have links back to the papers
* put more details in them if you have done more (e.g. snow study can start getting beefed up a bit)
* hyperlink [[ ]] relevant key words
* add something catchy (e.g. a picture of you doing something cool like an experiment [that kind of cool - not you surfing]), a graph from one of your publications (that has been altered to avoid copy right, etc.)


'''Potential Reviewers''' - January 14, 2011

First - I need your list of ten if you have not already sent it to me -- in the excel format - with ALL of the information I requested.
Second - email this to me - do NOT post it on Appropedia
Third - do not put anyone from queen's or anyone that either you or I have collaborated with in the last 5 years (e.g. published with).

This list will be used by me when submitting your articles for peer review as most journals either ask for or demand potential qualified reviewers.



'''Improve your CVs''' - October 18, 2011

This is just a helpful hint when applying for jobs/grants/grad school you should list under current employment:

Research Assistant in the Applied Sustainability Research Group Queen's University (along with any other groups you are associated with) - then briefly describe the projects you have worked on/are working on....See how those side projects pay off....


'''How to make a figure''' - September 20, 2010

This should be useful for everyone:
http://www.appropedia.org/How_to_make_a_figure_to_publish


'''Zotero''' - September 14, 2010

Would everyone please create a sub-group in zotero and put your work from this group in it and then add me to the group either as jpearce on zotero or via profpearce@gmail.com


'''Presentation template''' - September 4, 2010

Please use the attached for your future presentations: [[File:QueensTemplate-jmp.ppt]]


'''After you are published''' - June 23, 2010

I have refined the list of things to do after getting published. From now on - I will submit your publishing bonuses to you after you do these last few steps - to encourage rapid turnover http://www.appropedia.org/Category:Queens_Applied_Sustainability_Group#I_am_published_-_now_what.3F

I know it is a bit of a pain -- but trust me - this will be worth the small amount of extra effort and help you in the end. Similar to putting your refs in Zotero -- btw most papers should have their info imported into Zotero automatically if you use the DOI method that Kristen posted here:

'''Ordering stuff''' - June 11, 2010

For the second time this week we got stung with a hefty shipping charge. This should not happen -- the University should pick it up. To help prevent this please have all packages sent to me at the address below...and ensure that you put on the 'queens's university' part.

'''Citations''' - March 28, 2010

It is almost never ok to cite a webpage 

Only as a last resort. Generally if the document you are citing is a pdf - it will have a publisher -- and you treat it the same way as you would a book. If it is a government document it will have a document ID number.  

You NEVER cite journals as webpages.

If it is a journal article and happens to be on the web - that does not matter - you do NOT include the web address in your reference list in your paper. You do put the link on your appropedia page literature review.
