==Abstract==
This page is dedicated to the design and development of an open-source Hands-Free Crutch for the developing world. All components are designed with open-source software. OpenSCAD, FreeCAD and/or Blender have been utilized for digital file generation (STL). All components have been printed on a [http://www.appropedia.org/Athena_Build_Overview MOST - Athena Delta Printer]. [http://www.spinlife.com/images/product/4026.jpg Standard crutches] are produced between $10.00 and $120 [https://www.google.com/search?q=standard+crutch&biw=1439&bih=738&tbm=shop&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5v5jO-93QAhUrw1QKHZQQBfcQ_AUICCgB&dpr=1#spd=0 ref]. This Open Source Appropriate Technology (OSAT) aims to decrease the overall cost of a standard crutch and to enter the specialized market. This provides a 3D printed alternative by simultaneously allowing for customization based upon a user / patient's condition and size (height, weight, leg size, etc...).

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# 6mm Hex Wrench (Application: Tightening M6 Bolts)
# 10mm Wrench  (Application: To fixture nylon nut while tightening)
# A small hammer (Application: Tighten wire nails and fix the rubber on the crutch foot)

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* The significant design considerations that allow this part(s) to be printed with minimal support have already been accounted for in the provided files. Thus, any 3D printing operator with sufficient machine (~>3 months) experience should be able to successfully print these parts without trouble. 
* Useful tools that may help an inexperienced user:
** Modification of .scad files? Review the OpenSCAD [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual manual]
** Modification of .FCSTD files? Review the Free CAD[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_yHME82jW8  tricks]

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Print all printable parts from Bill of Materials. Printing time will be approximately 71 hours 58 mins.
#Insert M6 nut into the hexagonal insert on the leg rest (Front-Knee)
# Insert the tongue on the leg rest (Front-Knee) into the groove of the leg rest (Rear-Ankle). Press firmly until the internal faces of the two parts are flush.
# Insert M6 Bolt into the hole of the leg rest (Rear-Ankle). Thread into M6 nut. Tighten with Alan Wrench until tight. Repeat on opposite side.
# Thread 40mm Threaded Knee Rest Rods into the threaded holes on leg-rest(Front-Knee). Continue to tighten until resistance is felt.
# Thread 38mm Threaded Knee Rest Height Adjustment onto 40mm Threaded Knee Rest Rod. Adjust to desired height.
# Slide Knee Rest onto 38mm Threaded Knee Rest Height Adjustment.
# Thread Threaded Bottom Foot onto 58mm Female Threaded Height Adjustment. Tighten until tension is felt.
# Thread assembled 58mm Female-Threaded Height Adjustment onto 60mm Threaded Rod Support. Adjust to desired height.
# Assemble Secondary Support Rods with C-Clamp and 90mm M6 as shown in part gallery.
# Slide C-Clamp onto assembled 58mm Female-Threaded Height Adjustment.
# Insert ends of Secondary Support Rods into bottom holes of Leg-Rest (Front-Knee)
# Tighten M6 nut on C-clamp until tensioned around 58mm Female-Threaded Height Adjustment, until tension is felt.
# Feed desired straps through slots provided on top of leg rest(Rear-Ankle)           
# Assembly time will take approximately 10 minutes.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
# Ensure you do not apply excess force in tightening the bolts. These should tighten just until strain is felt on the wrench, no further.
# If threads do not fit correctly, an x-acto blade can be used to clean up any defects that are visible. Otherwise, the provided OpenSCAD includes parameter "tolerance", which can be increased or decreased s needed.
