"We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are." Anais Nin


"There are many ways to be poor, but in today's world not having the right kind of information represents a certain kind of poverty. As long as outsiders decide what is important and are in a position to ask all of the questions, we will never be able to solve our own problems. Without information we are nothing at all and have no power to understand things or to change our life. If Inuit society is to develop we must be able to collect and use information according to our own terms." A Nunavik Inuk

"To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.  And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders, nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect.  For the world has changed, and we must change with it." President Barack Hussein Obama, Inaugural Address <ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/inaugural-address/ The White House], January 2009</ref>


"Good governance and sound public management are preconditions for the implementation of [[sustainable development]] policies. These preconditions include efforts to ensure an ethical and more transparent government process, as well as decision-making practices “sufficiently open to citizens participation”. OECD <ref>Improving Policy Coherence and Integration for  Sustainable Development  - A Checklist  2002   [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/61/19/2763153.pdf] (PDF file) </ref> / [[Community involvement]]


“Every increase in local capacity to grow [[food]], generate energy, repair, build and finance will strengthen the capacity to withstand disturbances of all kinds.  Distributed energy in the form of widely disbursed solar and wind technology, for example, buffers communities from supply interruptions, failure of the electrical grid, and price shocks.  Similarly, a regionally based, solar-powered food system would restore small farms, preserve soil, create local employment, rebuilt stable economies, and provide better food while reducing carbon emissions and dependence on long-distance transport from distant suppliers.  The primary goal in rethinking development and economic growth is to create resilience – capacity to withstand the disturbances that will become more frequent and severe in the decades ahead”. David Orr <ref>‘Down to the Wire</ref>


"After all, if order is for free we could afford being out of control and love it." Harrison Owen <ref>[http://www.openspaceworld.com/brief_history.htm Opening Space for Emerging Order]</ref> / [[Open conference design]]

"...global IS the new local. Local meaning we really have reached the point — when considering shared assets like the atmosphere — that we’re all in the same neighborhood on a very small planet?"

"Community building power comes from the living database that the participants create and use together informally as they help each other solve problems, one to one and many to many. The web of human relationships that can grow along with the database is where the potential for cultural and political change can be found." Howard Rheingold 


"When you're one step ahead of the crowd you're a genius. When you're two steps ahead, you're a crackpot." Rabbi Shlomo Riskin (Feb. 1998)


"No-one asks our views... But we are the real experts of our own hopes and aspirations... We can contribute if you are prepared to give up a little power to allow us to participate as partners, in our own future, and the future of the country." Moraene Roberts


"Natural ecosystems will [only] be protected when society taxes the pumping of fresh [[water]], the damming of rivers and the felling of virgin timber. As polluters pay more, and those who tread more lightly on the [[Earth]] pay less, incentives are created for people to do the right thing." John Robbins

:"In too many countries and internationally, we still don't have governing systems and institutions that are accountable, participatory, consensus oriented, transparent, equitable and follow the rule of law." 


:"We don't need more walls of separation between nations and peoples. We know they can't protect us from global challenges like AIDS or terrorism or global warming. We need instead, more connections, more bridges of understanding and shared responsibility."

"Teach your children. What we have taught our children: that the [[earth]] is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons and daughters of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves. <br> <br> This we know. The earth does not belong to us. We belong to the earth. This we know. All things are connected Like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected. <br> <br>Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons and daughters of the earth. We did not weave the web of life, we are merely a strand in it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves." <br><br>Chief Seattle

"A shared vision is not an idea. It is not even an important idea such as freedom. It is, rather, a force in people's hearts, a force of impressive power. It may be inspired by an idea, but once it goes further -- if it is compelling enough to acquire the support of more than one person -- then it is no longer an abstraction. It is palpable. People begin to see it as if it exists. Few, if any, forces in human affairs are as powerful as shared vision." Peter Senge

:"We're going to look at every place that a reader or a listener or a viewer or a user has been locked out, has been served up passive or a fixed or a canned experience, and ask ourselves, "If we carve out a little bit of the cognitive surplus and deploy it here, could we make a good thing happen?" And I'm betting the answer is yes." <ref>[http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/ Clay Shirky] at a Web 2.0 conference, April 23, 2008.</ref>


:"a revolution doesn't happen when a society adopts new tools - it happens when it adopts new behaviours."

"In giving [[food]] to other beings and species we maintain conditions for our own food security. In feeding earthworms we feed ourselves. In feeding cows, we feed the soil, and in providing food for the soil, we provide food for humans. This worldview of abundance is based on sharing and on a deep awareness of humans as members of the earth family. This awareness that in impoverishing other beings, we impoverish ourselves and in nourishing other beings, we nourish ourselves is the real basis of sustainability." Vandana Shiva

"Somewhere, there are people to whom we can speak with passion<br>without having the words catch in our throats.<br>Somewhere a circle of hands will open to receive us,<br>Eyes will light up as we enter, voices will celebrate us whenever we come into our own power<br>Community means strength that joins our strength to do the work that needs to be done.<br>Arms to hold us when we falter. A circle of healing. A circle of friends.<br>Someplace where we can be free." <br>Starhawk
