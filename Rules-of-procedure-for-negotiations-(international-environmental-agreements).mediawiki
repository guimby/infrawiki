Rules of procedure are a standard part of the negotiations process for international environmental agreements. They assist in creating a structure to work within and provide guidance and direction for each particular negotiation process, including how decisions are made and finalised. The rules may determine who can participate, observer status, representation of specific regions or areas and specifics relating to voting. The rules of procedure help ensure the smooth running of the negotiations.

The rules of procedure set out the expectations on the parties involved, and also guarantee them a voice at the meeting.

Rules of procedure are often set out in the treaty under which the negotiations take place, while the finer details of such rules will be affected by administrative arrangements made by the secretariat. All parties should be in agreement as to the rules of procedure.
