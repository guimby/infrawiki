==History==
The goat shed was recently destroyed due to property rights issues. It has since been moved and rebuilt thanks in part to a grant from North Coast Co-op. Currently there are 5 goats that are used for ground maintenance, milk, and cheese.

==Shed== 
The shed includes a milking station and covered feeding area which are enclosed in a 1500 ft<sup>2</sup> pen. The milking station is 130 ft<sup>2</sup> while the covered feeding area is 100 ft<sup>2</sup>. The milking station is separated into two areas, one for milking and the other for sleeping. There is one window for natural light. The light also provides passive solar heat while allowing air flow. This helps protect the goat from direct sunlight but still allows light penetration that can be used for warmth. The open window allow for convection on hot windless days. The walls are built with dug-fir 2x4's and plywood while the roof consists of aluminum siding. Metal roofs have many benefits, including a long life span, and can leach less toxic materials into the environment compared to tar and fiberglass shingles. Metal roofs have a rustic look that some people find appealing. One downside is new custom ordered metal roofs are expensive. But used metal siding can be relatively cheap and easy to come by at any metal scrap yard.  The milking station is built on a raised platform protecting the goats from the cold, wet ground.
