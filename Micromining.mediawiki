The earth's crust is full of small mineral deposits but their recovery may not be economic under the current system. Small-scale or "micro" mining ("artisanal mining") can extract wealth from small mineral deposits that might not be worthwhile to exploit by traditional large-scale mining processes. Despite smaller size, '''these deposits may still allow for high-margin operations'''. Small communities may profitably mine these reserves, although this requires a different mind-set. Communities can use low-tech excavation techniques, down to pick and shovel. Even if the infrastructure is more advanced, it does not have to be purchased and can possibly be built by the community itself, drastically cutting up-front investment requirements. Some recent advances in technology, such as [[biomining]] and [[Low-Cost_Diagnostics|cheap sensors]] can easily be scaled down. 

==Problem statement==
* Economic models for mining have been based on corporate objectives rather than community needs 
* Systems used in resource exploitation are geared toward the highly specialized; a network of specialists is used to keep the systems running 
* These systems can sometimes exclude communities from participation. They can be marginalized due to lack of access to education.

==Some principles of community based micro-mining== 
# use machines that can be built from simple parts, are easy to use and repair
# minimize amount of material that is moved to the surface, try to process ''in situ'' and only transport the finished product  
# minimize energy requirements per cubic meter, use free energy that may be available (solar, hydro, biomass; other "stranded" energy) 
# ''slow but steady'' mining processes 
# multiple products; use tailing piles for '''something''' ! (... construction, build dam, make terraces for farming, pile them onto existing domes to create underground caves, etc.)  

==Open source micromining vs. traditional artisanal mining ==
* open source equipment reduces start-up cost 
* creative use of stranded energy 
* mining not for the general market but for own use of the mineral (= very different economics) 
* deep scientific understanding is required: metallurgy, chemistry, materials science, biotechnology; open source online education makes this accessible now 
* availability of inexpensive sensors, cameras and computing power  
* multiple products (e.g. extract multiple minerals, plan mining with an eye for subsequent use such as [[aquaculture]], construction or underground infrastructure). 
* for metallurgy, use of [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Induction_furnace induction furnace] and [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Digital_fabrication digital fabrication] are major improvements 
* advanced techniques for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_mine_ventilation underground mine ventilation] (e.g. using solar thermal or non-electric wind energy) 
* use of open source [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Aerial_Ropeways aerial ropeways] to transport large amounts of earth/rock
* low-level geothermal heat is major problem in traditional underground mining. Could be used for space heating in the future (greenhouses).

==Product Ecology==
* use of versatile agricultural equipment 
* mining of [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Aluminum_from_clay aluminum from clay] which can be found almost anywhere
* mining of copper with sulfuric acid (see: [[biomining]]) 
* use of [[biogas]] and syngas for carbothermal reduction of metals (example: [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Metal_Refining here]) 
* novel biotechnology techniques (see [[Biomining|biomining]]) 
* in underground mining: use of thermal ventilation or [http://openfarmtech.org/wiki/Compressed_Air compressed air]
