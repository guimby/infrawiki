'''Environmental psychology''' can mean one of two related things: 

''1) An interdisciplinary field focused on the interplay between humans and their surroundings.'' 

Various researchers have also termed this environmental social sciences, architectural psychology, socio-architecture, ecological psychology, ecopsychology, behavioral geography, environment-behavior studies, person-environment studies, environmental sociology, social ecology, and environmental design research.

This definition is an important field of study for good [[design]] of the [[built environment]] and [[urban planning]]. 

''2) The relationship between people's psychology, and their behavior in terms of [[sustainability]].''{{fact}} 

This is an unusual use of the term - choosing another term would be desirable for clarity. 

This subject is discussed at the Appropedia page on '''[[Psychology]]'''.
