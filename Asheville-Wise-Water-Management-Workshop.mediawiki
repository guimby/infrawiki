:Sunday Night, July 8<sup>th</sup> to Saturday Morning, July 14<sup>th</sup>, 2012
:9:00am - 5:30pm with some evening presentations

==Location==
:Ashevillage Institute, details below
:Asheville, North Carolina, United States

==Overview==
Water is vital for all known forms of life. Although 71% of the Earth's surface is covered in water, only 2.5% is fresh water, and estimates are that by 2025, more than half the world’s population will be vulnerable to a lack of water. Appropriate water supply and water purification technologies need to be put into action for the sake of humanity and our planet.

This one-week, hands-on training brings together water experts with water security enthusiasts to implement a project that provides practical knowledge for integrated water management. This is an experiential exploration of solutions that have the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges, and that can radically advance human well being and the health of our planet's ecosystems.

==Participant Criteria==
The goal of this training is to ‘green the campus.’ A total of eight schools total can participate, with teams of two representatives from each (a total of 16 participants). In order to participate, you must have: 1) a follow up project that can be implemented on your school’s campus, and 2) two participating representatives who are committed to working together with their school to help implement their campus project. When filling out your application below, please include these details.

==Learn==
Through hands-on projects, demonstrations, presentations, classes and facilitated group discussions, participants will gain:
* Experience installing a system that addresses water security, rainwater management, runoff erosion reduction; integrating systems into a whole cycle that bolster food production, income, and natural habitat  
* Firsthand knowledge of water conservation systems, bio- and myco-remediation for water, backyard aquaponics, and integrated food production
* Ability to design systems for rainwater harvesting, remediation, natural water filtration and greywater treatment
* Understanding of how to scale systems from household to small community size for increased water security, independence and resilience
* Deepened insight into the global water crisis and water science, structure, quality and testing
