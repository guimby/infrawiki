'''[http://fr.ekopedia.org Ekopedia]''' is a free (Creative Commons), collaborative (wiki), and multilingual encyclopedia project dedicated in providing answers and spreading practical knowledge related to environmental sustainability. Their goal is to help everyone become more independent and establish the foundation necessary to build a better world.

== History ==
Created in Quebec in December 2002 under the name of ''Newlimits.org'', the project was initially in French and under Free Art License. It was using TWiki wiki application for collaborative edition and in 2004, community decided to migrate to MediaWiki. 

The project got over 1000 articles December, 10 2006<ref>[http://fr.ekopedia.org/Ekopedia:Ekopedia_d%C3%A9passe_les_1000_articles Ekopedia dépasse les 1000 articles]</ref>. In February 2007, English<ref>[http://en.ekopedia.org/ Ekopedia in English]</ref> and Esperanto<ref> [http://eo.ekopedia.org/ Ekopedia in Esperanto]</ref> Projects were created. Italian<ref> [http://it.ekopedia.org Ekopedia in Italian]</ref>, German<ref>[http://de.ekopedia.org Ekopedia in German]</ref> and Polish<ref>[http://pl.ekopedia.org Ekopedia in Polish]</ref> were created in February and March 2008 and the Spanish<ref> [http://es.ekopedia.org Ekopedia in Spanish]</ref> in November 2008. Ekopedia has about 2500 articles (> 1 800 in French).

The Ekopedia Foundation was created in September 19, 2007<ref>http://www.fondationekopedia.org/Image:Lettres-patentes-fondation-ekopedia.png</ref>

In april 2009, Ekopedia has migrate all its contents from Free Art License to Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA-3.0)<ref>http://en.ekopedia.org/Ekopedia:Licence-Migration-CC-BY-SA-3.0</ref> in order to facilitate content sharing with other projects like Wikipedia, and [[Appropedia]].

After Ekopedia went off-line around mid-2015, its [http://fr.ekopedia.org french version] is back online as of february 2017, with almost 2500 articles. Some info on Ekopedia's recovery can be found [[Talk:Ekopedia#Ekopedia recovery|here]].

== Project details ==
'''Ekopedia''' gives people solutions and practical knowledge in order to act in a more environmentally sound way. Ekopedia is a wiki-based website (like Wikipedia) using MediaWiki. Ekopedia now licensed under Creative Commons CC-BY-SA-3.0 (after having been under Free Art Licence for more than 6 years)<ref>http://en.ekopedia.org/Ekopedia:Copyright</ref>.

Ekopedia is developed mainly in French, Polish, and Italian. In 2008, French Project received 2,3 millions uniques visitors and each day, an average of 11,000 people come to visit and participate in the project, which makes Ekopedia the most visited<ref>[http://www.fondationekopedia.org/Bilan_2008_du_projet_%C3%89kop%C3%A9dia#Pr.C3.A9sentation_du_projet Bilan 2008 du projet Ekopedia.org]</ref> French website focused on [[ecology]] and [[sustainability]] issues.

Ekopedia articles are organized around 12 topics in order to meet the basics needs of people : Birth, Education, Food, Lodging, Clothing, Art and craft, Thinking, Living together, Health and care, Travel, Play and Communication. There are thus many articles on [[green building]], washable diapers, seasonal vegetables, [[electric vehicles]] or even [[tofu]] manufacturing.

Ekopedia is different to Wikipedia as certain types of content and collaboration are not suitable for Wikipedia<ref>[http://fr.ekopedia.org/Ekopedia:Wikipedia Ekopedia is different from Wikipedia]</ref>. In contrast to Wikipedia, Ekopedia content requires a different approach in selecting and writing articles.

Since the end of 2008, Appropedia and Ekopedia Projects are in active collaboration that could lead to a projects merge<ref>Ekopedia and Appropedia are adopting a deep but adaptable partnership: [[Appropedia:Memorandum of Understanding/Ekopedia]].</ref>.
