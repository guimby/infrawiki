'''Embodied energy''' is defined as the energy (renewable,fossil fuels, nuclear, etc.) that was used in the work to make any product, bring it to market, and dispose of it. Embodied energy is an accounting methodology which aims to find the sum total of the energy (e.g. [[net energy]]) necessary for an entire product lifecycle. This lifecycle includes raw material extraction, transport, manufacture, assembly, installation, disassembly, deconstruction and/or decomposition. It is normally found by doing a [[lifecycle analysis.]]
