Hello Appropedia User,

Please help me appropriately fit into appropedia,
I am new to Wiki using and also not sure what category to go with.

My intention is two-fold:
* to compile information with "1000 Farm Vision"^SavouryCows
* to represent that information for private, government and corporate interests
.^

The quotation of "1000 Farm Vision" is from Paul Wheaton,
aiming to compile best information on what this means to anyone-together,
rather then projecting with my impetus right away.

SavouryCows refers to work of Savoury Institute,
the importance of animals in re-balancing the "climate",
essentially and effectively with the distinct project.

There were two options for "Create a Page":
* this 
* "project"
.^

Next time I'll post some links.

~Tom.
