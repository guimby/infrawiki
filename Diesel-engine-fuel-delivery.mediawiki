==Timing==

Fuel delivery timing effects the engine in a number of ways

Advancing the injection timing has the following effects:

Increasing
* Cylinder pressures/temperatures
* Black smoke at peak torque
* Emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
* Black smoke at peak torque

Decreasing
* White smoke
* Black smoke at tick over
* Black smoke at designed rated power
* Exhaust temperature
* Brake specific fuel consumption
* Hydrocarbons (HC)

Setting the injection timing involves balancing power and emission requirements.  The engine material tolerances limit the advance due to the increase in peak pressure/temperature.
