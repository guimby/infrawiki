==Solar Charger Robin Deterrent==

===Robins were causing shading on the solar panel===
This shading was interfering with the efficiency of the panel.  This was causing extra work for the farmer, it is a long walk back to replace the battery with a fresh one from the barn where there is a 110v charger.  After replacing the battery the panel had to be cleaned off as well.
===Attaching these pieces of wire made the solar panel an unattractive perch===

====Materials List====
#Wire, I used steel, about 18 gauge
#Wire cutters or pliers

====Order of operation====
#First cut the wire into pieces about 8 inches long
#Wrap the wire around somewhere and twist it like a twist tie.  I used the handle of the charger as an attachment point.
#Bend the wires around so that they stick up menacingly at the pesky robins.  Be careful not to bend the wire so that it shades the panel.

====Testing====
*After the wires were in place the robins quit perching on the solar charger.
*After a rain storm the wires started to rust, consider stainless steel wire.
