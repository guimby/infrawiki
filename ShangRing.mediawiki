==Problem being addressed==
HIV/AIDS is a devastating epidemic that affects millions of people around the globe. Circumcision has been shown to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission by up to 60%.(citation needed) There is a need for low-cost and easy-to-use technologies that enable health care providers with limited training to perform the procedure.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The ShangRing is a new circumcision tool that helps health care providers with limited training to perform circumcision.  There is no cutting or suturing of the foreskin.  The device consists of two parts (rings).  The outer ring applies constant pressure to the foreskin, which leads to the foreskinâ€™s removal.  The device must remain on the penis for 5-7 days.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: Shang Jianzhong, a Chinese inventor from Wuhu City, China, invented and patented ShangRing.
*Manufacturer location: China.
*Manufacturer: Wuhu Santa Medical Equipment Technology Co. Ltd. Website is found [http://www.snnda.com/enindex.asp here].

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
The ShangRing has been tested in China, Kenya and the United States. It is currently undergoing testing in the latter two countries. It is being used routinely for non-therapeutic, non-preventative circumcision in the United Kingdom [https://www.circumcision-london.co.uk/adult-circumcision/ at this private clinic in London].
