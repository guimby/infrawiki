This article deals discusses the different techniques of metal working and explains the most appropriate way for people in developing/developed countries to make useful metal objects. 

==Blacksmithing and casting==
[[Blacksmithing]] is a very energy efficient method of making metals but it requires skill, which offcourse can't be picked up overnight. In addition, metal objects made this way have no uniformity.

[[Casting]] requires much less skill, and also creates uniform metal objects. Another advantage is that it can also make very complex structures. A disadvantage is however its high energy consumption, although this can be reduced to a large extent by an efficient factory setup.

A blend of casting and to some extent blacksmithing could be useful. Also, [[welding equipment]] and post-treatment tools for ie grinding, ... (powertools; see [[AT factory]]) is also required. This can be done ie in workshops.

==Joining metals==
This can be done by [[Metal joining techniques]].
