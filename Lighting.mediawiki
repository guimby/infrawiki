'''Lighting''' or '''illumination''' is the use of light for improving visibility at night. Lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources (ie lamps), as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight (ie using [[windows]], [[skylights]] (sometimes makeshift with [[soda bottles]]).

These include [[fuel-based lighting]] and [[electric lighting]] methods. Fuel-based lighting is often far less energy efficient than combusting [[biofuel|(bio)fuel]] in a [[Electricity generator|gen-set]] and using the electricity of this gen-set to power a electric device such as a lamp (even [[incandescent]]s, and definitely using [[compact fluorescent lights]], [[LED lighting]] or [[LEC lighting]].{{w|Light-emitting electrochemical cell}}{{fact}}

That said, fuel-based lighting can be much cheaper as a short term solution owing to the set-up costs of an electricity infrastructure (whether grid power or a small scale setup of a solar panel and a battery). Poor people in the [[majority world]] hence often stick to fuel-based lighting methods. These create a lot of smoke, the amount depending on the method and fuel used, and the resulting [[indoor air pollution]] has serious negative impacts on health - causing eye and respiratory illness in particular.
