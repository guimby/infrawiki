== Who should come? ==
Everyone interested in exploring free content and knowledge sharing in sustainability, international development, appropriate technology and solutions to poverty. However, OSN is inclusive of all communities working online to improve the world, so our scope is broader than this.

== Why? ==
Thousands of organizations and millions of people are currently working to effectively tackle a set of profound global challenges through the creation, adoption and commercialization of sustainable approaches and clean technologies. Our efforts are fragmented. It is time to promote a culture of working together while maintaining our own special niches by leveraging shared and openly licensed solutions.

This conference is organized by a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to positive social change. Appropedia is only providing the forum through which we collaborate. Join us for the first Open Sustainability Network unconference as we explore free content and knowledge sharing in sustainability, international development, appropriate technology and solutions to poverty.
