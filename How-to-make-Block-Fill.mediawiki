==What is Block Fill==
I spent a lot of time googling and couldn't find another name for it so block fill it is.

Block fill is a mixture that is poured into blocks that have holes in them, specifically in the ones that contain the rebar. Rebar is a reinforcing steel used when building with blocks to provide tensile strength. Block fill provides further strength for the rebar and can also be poured into the other holes.

==Materials==
===Tools===
* 5 Gallon Buckets
* Small Buckets for pouring into holes
* Pickax
* 2 Shovels
* Gloves
* Masks

===Ingredients===
* 48 shovels of Arena y Tabo (sand)
* 1/4 meter Gravel
* 1 Bag of Cement
* Approximately 6-8 full 5 Gallon Buckets of Water

| Shovel the ingredients into a pile and go around in a circle, preferably with a friend, shoveling it all into the center making a "mountain". 
|-

| Use your shovel and place it at the peak of the mountain. Pull it downward towards yourself creating a hole in the middle. Go around the pile repeating this until you get a "volcano" shape. Repeat steps 1 & 2 about 5 times.

| Fill the volcano up with water almost to the top. Go around the circle shoveling the outer most dry blend into the center. You'll get to a point that the volcano starts to leak at all the water is starting to pour out. When this happens scoop a shovel of dry material where the leak is. Continue going around until there is no more water.

| As one can see from the picture, there is still a significant amount of dry material along the perimeter of the volcano. This is when you use the shovel to finish mixing all of the water with the materials. Now you should try to create another volcano or just make space to put water in the center and shovel the majority of the dry material into the center.

| Using the pickax in a pulling and pushing motions makes mixing a lot easier. You want your fill to be water so that it pours into the blocks with ease.

| Last step is to fill your mini buckets up with fill and pour it down some block holes!
