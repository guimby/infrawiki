== What is a Cesspit? ==

A cesspit is a sealed holding tank that does not have an outlet pipe. 

It is most often used for storing sewage and wastewater where the ground is not suitable for soaking away the effluent from a septic tank. 


== Cesspit Construction ==

Older cesspits are generally constructed out of block, bricks, or concrete, whilst modern ones are constructed using fibreglass or plastic. They usually have only a single access lid for emptying and a vent to allow foul gases, including Methane and Hydrogen Sulphide, to exit the tank.


== Cesspit Sizing ==

Cesspits are sized according to the number of people who use them. The smallest cesspit allowed for a house with one bedroom is around 18,000 litres. This size increases by 6,800 litres for every additional person.


== Function of Cesspits ==

A cesspit does not treat sewage and wastewater. There is no reduction of pollutants as it is only a storge tank.
Cesspits are also used for the storage of waste liquids, silage effluent, caravan cassette toilets, etc. which cannot be discharged to either a septic tank or sewage treatment plant due to the toxicity of the effluents concerned.
