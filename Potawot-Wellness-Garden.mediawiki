== Purpose and Impact ==
Encircled by the Gathering Room and the main offices at [[Potawot]], the Wellness Garden (Figure 1) is filled with various native plants from the Northwestern region of the [[U.S.]]{{w|U.S.}} These plants are used to educate the patients at Potawot about traditional plants and herbs used in healing.  These species tend to be easy to grow and maintain so as to promote self-sustainability within the community.   Potawot Health Village's visitors can come to learn about the medicinal and nutritional uses of these plants, while also enjoying the serenity of nature and using it to aid in the rehabilitation process if needed. Some of the plants in the garden have a high nutritional value, but most are in place to  simulate the environment in this part of California.  The plants are all described in detail in the table below (Figures 2-13).  <ref> "TCWF Final Grant Report", recieved from Eric Johnson on October 28, 2008.</ref> 


The stream that runs through the Wellness Garden's 10,000 square feet contributes hugely to the native shrubs, flowers, trees and medicinal herbs that grow within it.  The stream winds through the garden starting at the far end, traveling across the length, passing underneath and around the front of the building, and finally underneath the entry bridge.  The stream then flows south into a pond where the re-circulation pumps send the water to begin the process again.  This stream demonstrates another aspect of Northern California's diverse environment.  <ref> "TCWF Final Grant Report", received from Eric Johnson on October 28, 2008.</ref>

==Update October 2014==

This garden looks like it has not been given any yard work attention in the recent months. The architecture of the facility was well constructed giving the ability for native vegetation to thrive. All vegetation is native to the Northwest environment maintaining the original plan of sustaining native plant life. Vegetation expansion has over taken the facility. Signs of neglect in maintenance can be seen through out the garden. Plants have grown on top of one another and have invaded each other’s territory.  The stream looks like it inhabits a lot of algae. The position of the garden surrounded by the building allows for a visual sense of serenity.  The environment built around this garden stimulates a comfortable environment for the patients and visitors of Potawot . The purpose of sustaining a well kept rehabilitation village still remains. 

The original article that was published stated that the garden was, “easy to grow and maintain” the current status does not reflect the original intended goals. The original project’s intentions were to educate the patients at Potawot of the traditional plants and herbs used in healing. The current status of the garden hinders the ability of education from observing the garden because of the lack of maintenance and educational signs. With out prior botany knowledge it would difficult to identify the species and benefits each individual plant holds. Adding signs to the garden can better educate visitors and the patients of Potawot. Giving a description of the major vegetation in the garden can add to the purpose and impact of this garden on it’s community.  Nearly all the vegetation that was listed on the site was not seen in the garden.  This may be the case if certain vegetation is not in season.
