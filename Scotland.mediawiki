=== Trees, woodland and forest ===

{{#widget:YouTube|id=tgWmuJwOjJY}}

[http://www.treesforlife.org.uk/ Trees for Life], ([[wikipedia:eDay|Wikipedia]]): award-winning registered charity working to restore the Caledonian Forest and its unique wildlife to the Scottish Highlands. The charity was formed in 1989 by Alan Watson Featherstone. The Caledonian Forest once covered a large area of the Highlands of Scotland as extensive stands of majestic Scots pine, interspersed with birch, rowan, juniper and aspen trees, but is now reduced to less than 5% of its former extent. Through planting native species of trees, removing non-native species and fencing seedlings to protect them from overgrazing by deer and sheep, Trees for Life aim to help the natural regeneration of the forest. Their long-term goal is to create a fully restored, healthy ecosystem, which will include the reintroduction of missing species of wildlife, such as the European beaver, wild boar, Eurasian lynx and Eurasian wolf. The vast majority of their work is carried out by volunteers. By engaging people from diverse backgrounds, they aim to achieve a powerful and educational experience that will promote the work of restoration to wider audiences and lead to increased support for the return of the forest and its species.
