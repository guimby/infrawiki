The Mid-Michigan bioregion is home to a number of both for-profit and nonprofit cooperative enterprises, including the Mid-Michigan Time Bank, the Lansing Maker's Network, and the Mid-Michigan Renewable Energy Cooperative. By leveraging time, tools, and talents, these groups will form the backbone of the Mid-Michigan Mutual Aid Network to help the region find new ways to build a sustainable new economy.

"Mutual Aid Networks provide a platform for communities to build from the ground up through identifying strengths and resources that are present globally which can be put into action through local location-specific projects," says Marshall Clabueaux, a renewable energy activist and social entrepreneur. <ref>[http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-mutual-aid-network-takes-a-ground-up-approach-to-create-a-collaborative-economy Shareable]</ref>
