[http://risingtide.org.uk/ Rising Tide UK] is the United Kingdom part of the International Rising Tide Network, both of which were created in 2000 to carry out direct action against the root causes of climate change, and to work towards a fossil fuel free future. RTUK takes a no-compromise position and believes that only the complete dismantling of the fossil fuel industry and a shift to low consumption lifestyles will be sufficient to halt climate change. Rising Tide UK is formed of regional and local groups in the UK, and supports networks of similar groups around the country. Actions carried out by Rising Tide UK groups range from protests and street-theatre style events, to mass occupations of petrol stations, and blockades of key fossil fuel industrial sites. {{W|Rising Tide UK}}

Large fall in UK emissions in 2014, official figures confirm, March 26 <ref>[http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/03/large-fall-in-uk-emissions-in-2014-official-figures-confirm/ Carbon Brief]</ref> 

:UK carbon dioxide emissions fell by 9.7% in 2014 year-on-year, according to official figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change. 

:The carbon dioxide reduction is the largest on record for a growing UK economy. The 9.7% carbon reduction leaves UK emissions 29% below 1990 levels, at 422 million tonnes. Estimated 2014 UK greenhouse gas emissions of 520.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent would be 36% below 1990 levels. 

:The UK is aiming to halve its emissions by 2025 and cut them by 80% by 2050, both against 1990 levels. Today's figures suggest the UK has met an interim target to cut emissions in 2020 by at least 34%, six years early. Transport emissions increased a small amount in 2014, with a 1% increase on 2013. 

:UK energy demand keeps falling, down 10% between 1990 and 2014. UK energy demand peaked in around 2005 and has been falling ever since. A similar picture is being repeated across the EU, where energy use has fallen back to 1990 levels despite a 6% increase in population and a 45% expansion of economic output. Official figures published last week suggest UK emissions have fallen since 1990 even if you include emissions embedded in imported goods.
