'''Climate Interactive''' is a not-for-profit organization with its base in Washington DC, USA.<ref name="CI">https://www.climateinteractive.org/about/</ref> It aims to find out ways to address climate change and related issues, and has a range of tools which help to provide data, analysis and simulations. It terms its work approaches as "multisolving", a way to find systemic solutions for protecting the climate while also enhancing health, equity and well-being.<ref>https://www.climateinteractive.org/</ref>

Climate Interactive has five underpinnings or "roots" that inspire their work:<ref name="CI" />

*1. Dana Meadows' vision of combining scientifically-grounded analysis with advanced learning technologies. This also includes keeping a positive vision to create a sustainable world.
*2. System Dynamics simulation modeling from MIT's Sloan School of Management.
*3. "Open architecture sharing", making the accessible simulation models available for adaptation and extension.
*4. Investing in contexts and settings for learning. This includes creating simulation interfaces, role-playing policy exercises and workshop approaches that generate insights from using the tools.
*5. Engaging in "climate, sustainability, energy, and resilience strategy at national and international levels".<ref name="CI" />
