[[Open source 3-D printing of OSAT]] is gaining traction as groups like [[Re:3D]] (makers of the [[Gigabot]]) have sponsored [https://www.younoodle.com/podium/jr/great_big_gigabot_giveaway_judging/public_voting#0 contests] to encourage designers to think about using 3D printers for social good, Michigan Tech sponsored the [[3D printers for peace contest]], the [[Plastic Bank]], [[Techfortrade]] and the [[Ethical Filament Foundation]] are developing a new social economy for [[recycled 3D printer filament]] and [[Tekla Lab]] sponsored a contest to make [[open source lab]] equipment.

'''Do you have a great idea for a [[open-source appropriate technology]] that could be [[3-D print]]ed?'''
First check out all the existing designs [[:Category:OSAT_3D-Printable_Designs|here]]. If you can not find it then click the "edit" below and post your idea. If you have an Appropedia account you can tag it with your signature <nowiki>--~~~~</nowiki>

In the Fall every year MTU will be offering a [[MY4777| class in open-source 3-D printing]]. One of the assignments will be to design and prototype [[OSAT]]. 50 students use this page for ideas.

Designers if you see a request for an item you would like to work on - you can tag it with your signature <nowiki>--~~~~</nowiki> as well and leave a message for the requester or collaborators.

* '''Shapeways drone - rescue contest''' http://www.shapeways.com/contests/take-flight-with-dji-and-shapeways - fire fighters and other first responders use drones, like the DJI Phantom 4, to help in search and rescue operations? With its long range and integrated camera, the DJI Phantom 4 make it a valuable tool when searching for a small body in a large body of water. Now is your opportunity to help save more lives with 3D printing. Your mission is to design accessories to be added to the DJI Phantom 4 to help make it into the ultimate rescue drone.

* The FireAnt Prototype (contact: Wayne Johnson, email: wayne.johnson@friluftslivtech.com , Friluftsliv Farm, Turtle Lake, North Dakota)
Small commercial robots designed to withstand outdoor environments currently
cost over $10,000. This puts these devices out of reach for smallholder farmers
with less than a hundred acres. Our goal is to drive these costs under $1,000 in
successive iterations through open source designs and 3D printing. FireAnt will
eventually be a 3D printable small-scale multipurpose robotic system to which
one could add a variety of accessories for doing tasks around the farm. The first
step is to create a rolling chassis and body to house the electronic hardware and
power supplies and provide structure for the four wheels that will be driven by
electric motors. It is essentially an inner box within an outer box. The outer
box provides a way to attach the wheel/electric motor assembly, and store a
Li-ion traction battery pack and a microcontroller that takes input from a GPS,
gyroscope, and accelerometer and controls the wheel assembly motors. On top
of the outer box would be a mounting plate and a mounting pattern that allows
other devices such as cameras, LIDAR, robotic arms, etc. to be mounted with
openings for the cables that connect these devices to its internal PC. The inner
box would house a PC power supply and an internal PC (e.g. Mini-ITX PC)
and other electronic equipment that the user may add. The dimensions of the
outer box would be 13" W x 20" L x 10" H with a clearance of 2.5" from the
ground. A wheel with tire is about 2" W x 8" H. The user should be able to
easily remove the inner box to access the contents of the outer box. More details
and examples will be provided on request.
* Latrine/toilet sits or squads for children that can be used in emergency response on top of a latrine pit
* Water testing kit parts â€“ for example pieces found in the Delagua or Wagtech water testing kit
*  Innovative designs for a new type of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) bracelet --bracelet/band that measures children and classifies them as malnourished which then [[Action Against Hunger]] does treatment and prevention work for.  The traditional MUAC [http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/MUAC-Measuring-Tape-26-5_555780882.html] is graduated and needs to be placed at the exact middle of the left upper arm of the child. The tension of the band is adjusted by the person collecting the data. Often errors with too tight or too loose tape measurements are observed. What we are hoping to develop is a MUAC bracelet that has a standard circumference of 115 mm (the threshold for acute malnutrition in young children). The bracelet would fit on an arm with a circumference of 115 mm or less and would fasten together via a clasp mechanism (to be determined). We are looking at designs that can be produced cheaply, so the less component parts the better. [[User:Akhenry|Akhenry]] ([[User talk:Akhenry|talk]]) 17:48, 17 November 2015 (PST)
