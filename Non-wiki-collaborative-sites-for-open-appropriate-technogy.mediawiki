Questions to be answered: 
* How easy is it - in terms of license, and the process of contributions - to edit or adapt designs on the site? Is it possible to annotate another person's designs (as when the design is posted to a wiki) or is it necessary to go through multiple steps such as downloading, adapting and uploading.
