Water does not get "used up" when we use it - it simply changes form. Rather than throwing it away. When we learn to use that water many times over before returning it to the [[environment]], we have moved from [[scarcity]] to [[abundance]].

Waste water in many cases is simply "water with nutrients". While nutrients in clean water is a bad thing (see [[eutrophication]]), this water does have uses:
* in water for irrigation, the nutrients are is a good thing - as long as there are no toxins, or pollutants that the receiving ecosystem can't handle. (Choice of [[detergent]] is key when reusing [[greywater]] from a [[laundry]].)
* in [[flush toilets]], some nutrients are harmless. This is a matter of the nature of the pollutants, the concentration and how long since productin. (Leaving greywater for a long period, e.g. 24 hours, potentially allows [[pathogens]] to breed, so it is then regarded as [[blackwater]], i.e. a health hazard.)
