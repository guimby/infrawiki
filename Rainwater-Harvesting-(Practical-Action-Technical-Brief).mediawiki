== Introduction ==
A sufficient, safe drinking water supply is essential to life. However, millions of people throughout the world still do not have access to this basic necessity. After decades of work by governments and organizations to bring potable water to the poorer people of the world, the situation is still dire. The reasons are many and varied, but generally speaking, the [[poor]] of the world cannot afford the capital intensive and technically complex traditional water supply systems. Unfortunately these technologies are widely promoted by governments and agencies throughout the world. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an alternative to these unaffordable options. It has been adopted in many areas of the world where conventional water supply systems have not been provided, too expensive or failed to meet people’s needs. RWH is a proven technology that has been in use since ancient times. <br>

Examples of RWH systems can be found throughout history. In industrialized countries, sophisticated RWH systems have been developed to reduce water bills or to meet the needs of remote communities or individual households in arid regions. RWH is also used in developing
countries. In Uganda and Sri Lanka, for example, rainwater is traditionally collected from trees, using banana leaves or stems as temporary gutters. Up to 200 liters may be collected in this way from a large tree in a single storm. Many individuals and groups have taken the
initiative and developed a wide variety of RWH systems throughout the world. <br>

Many kinds of rainwater harvesting are practiced throughout the world. Basically RWH may be divided into two types: <br>
'''• Domestic RWH''' <br>
'''• RWH for agriculture, erosion control, flood control and aquifer replenishment''' <br>

Domestic RWH is a simple mechanism to collect and store rainwater mainly for drinking and cooking. It may be household based or community based. The system uses a collection surface such as a roof, gutters to guide the rainwater, and a container to store the water. <br>

Larger RWH systems are used for water resource management. These systems use vast catchment areas to collect rainwater and store it in reservoirs. The water is then used for irrigation or to recharge aquifers. These systems may also help in flood control and erosion prevention by holding storm water into reservoirs and discharging at a controlled rate. <br>

This paper involves domestic RWH only. We must remember that rainwater harvesting is not the ultimate answer to household water problems. Many factors have to be considered when selecting the appropriate water source. These include cost, climate, hydrology, social and political elements, as well as technology. All of these play a role in making the final choice of a suitable water supply scheme. RWH is only one of many possible choices. But RWH is often overlooked by planners, engineers and builders. <br>

The reason that RWH is rarely considered is often due to barriers such as lack of technical and other information. In many areas where RWH has been introduced as a part of drinking water supply options, it was at first un-popular. This was simply because little was known about the technology by the beneficiaries. In most of these cases, the technology has quickly
gained popularity. The users soon realised the benefits of a clean, reliable water source at the home. This is especially true in areas where the town supply is unreliable or where local water sources dry up for a part of the year. In many cases RWH has also been introduced as a part
of an integrated water supply system. It is a technology that is flexible and adaptable to a very wide variety of conditions. RWH is used in the richest and the poorest societies on our planet, and in the wettest and the driest regions of the world.

== Components of a domestic RWH system ==
Domestic RWH systems (DRWH) vary in complexity. Some of the traditional Sri Lankan systems are no more than a pot situated under a piece of cloth or a plastic sheet tied to four poles. The cloth captures the water and diverts it through a hole in its centre into the pot. In contrast, some of the sophisticated systems manufactured in Germany incorporate clever
computer management systems, submersible pumps, and links to [[grey water]] and domestic plumbing system mains. Somewhere between these two extremes, we find the typical DRWH system in use in developing countries. Such a system will usually comprise a collection surface (a clean roof or ground area), a storage tank, and guttering to transport the water from
the roof to the storage tank. Other peripheral equipment is sometimes incorporated, for example: first-flush systems to divert the dirty water which contains roof debris after prolonged dry periods; filtration equipment and settling chambers to remove debris and contaminants before water enters the storage tank or cistern; hand pumps for water extraction;
water level indicators, etc.

== Typical domestic RWH systems ==
A typical domestic RWH consists of a collection surface, gutters and a storage container. In addition, there are options for diverting first-flush water and filtration.

====Collection Surfaces====
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.1.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 1: A typical corrugated iron sheet roof, showing guttering]]
For domestic rainwater harvesting the most common surface for collection is the roof of the dwelling. Many other surfaces can be, and are, used: courtyards, threshing areas, paved walking areas, plastic sheeting, trees, etc. In some cases, as in Gibraltar, large rock surfaces are used to collect water which is then stored in large tanks at the base of the rock slopes. The style, construction and material of the roof affect its suitability as a collection surface for water. Typical materials for roofing include corrugated iron sheet (also known as tin roof), asbestos sheet; tiles (a wide variety is found), slate, and thatch (from a variety of organic materials). Most thatch are suitable for collection of rainwater, but only certain types of grasses e.g. coconut and anahaw palm (Gould and Nissen Peterson, 1999), thatched tightly, provide a surface adequate for high quality water collection. The rapid move towards the use of corrugated iron sheets in many developing countries favors the promotion of RWH.



====Guttering====
Guttering is used to transport rainwater from the roof to the storage vessel. Guttering comes in a wide variety of shapes and forms, ranging from the factory made PVC type to home-made guttering using bamboo or folded metal sheet (Figure 1). Guttering is usually fixed to the building just below the roof and catches the water as it falls from the roof. Some common types of guttering and fixings are shown in Figure 2 :
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.2.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2: a variety of guttering types showing possible fixings]]
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.3a.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3a: Folding galvanized steel sheet to make V-shaped guttering]]
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.3b.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3b: Cutting plastic pipe into half to make gutter]]
====Manufacture of low-cost gutters====
Factory-made gutters are usually
expensive and beyond the reach
of the poor people of developing
countries, if indeed available at
all in the local marketplace.
They are seldom used for very
low-cost systems. The
alternative is to make gutters
from materials that can be found
cheaply in the locality. There
are a number of techniques that
have been developed to help
meet this demand; one such
technique is described below.
V- shaped gutters from
galvanised steel sheet can be
made simply by cutting and
folding flat galvanised steel
sheet (Figure 3a). Such sheet is
readily available in most market
centres (otherwise corrugated
iron sheet can be beaten flat)
and can be worked with tools
that are commonly found in a
modestly equipped workshop.
One simple technique is to
clamp the cut sheet between two
lengths of straight timber and
then to fold the sheet along the
edge of the wood. A
strengthening edge can be added
by folding the sheet through 90o
and then completing the edge
with a hammer on a hard flat
surface. The better the grade of
steel sheet that is used, the
more durable and durable the
product. Fitting a downpipe to
V-shaped guttering can be
problematic and the V-shaped
guttering will often be continued
to the tank rather than changing
to the customary circular pipe
section downpipe. Methods for
fixing gutters are shown in Figure
3a.
Plastic pipes may be cut into
half to make gutters (Figure 3b).
This requires only a saw and
some clamps to fix the half-pipes
to roofs. It may be made quickly
and cheaply in areas where
plastic pipes are available.



====Storage tanks and cisterns====
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.4a.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 4a: An owner-built brick tank in Sri Lanka]]
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.4b.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 4b: A corrugated iron RWH tank in Uganda]]
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.5.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 5: Ferrocement tank in Ruganzu Village, Tanzania.]]
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.6.jpg|thumb|right|Figure 6: Small jars used in Cambodia as part of a multi-sourced water supply.]]
The water storage tank usually represents the biggest capital investment element of a
domestic RWH system. It therefore requires careful design to provide optimal storage
capacity while keeping the cost as low as possible. The catchment area is usually the existing
rooftop or occasionally a cleaned area of ground, as seen in the courtyard collection systems
in China. The guttering for the system can often be obtained relatively cheaply, or can be
manufactured locally.
There are an almost unlimited number of options for storing water. Common vessels used for
very small-scale water storage in developing countries include plastic bowls and buckets,
jerrycans, clay or ceramic jars, cement jars, old oil drums, empty food containers, etc. For
storing larger quantities of water, the system will require a tank or a cistern. For the purpose
of this document, we will classify the tank as an above-ground storage vessel and the cistern
as a below-ground storage vessel. These can vary in size from a cubic metre or so (1000
litres) up to hundreds of cubic metres for large projects. The typical maximum size for a
domestic system is 20 or 30 cubic metres. The choice of system will depend on a number of
technical and economic considerations listed below.

* Space availability
* Options available locally
* Local traditions for water storage
* Cost of purchasing new tank
* Cost of materials and labour for construction
* Materials and skills available locally
* Ground conditions
* Use of RWH – whether the system will provide total or partial water supply <br>

One of the main choices will be whether to use a tank or a cistern. Both tanks and cisterns
have their advantages and disadvantages. Table 1 summarizes the pros and cons of each:
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.table.1.jpg]]



==== First-flush systems ====
Debris, dirt, dust and droppings will collect on the roof of a building or other collection area.
When the first rains arrive, this unwanted matter will be washed into the tank. This will cause
contamination of the water and the quality will be reduced. Many RWH systems therefore
incorporate a system for diverting this ‘first flush’ water so that it does not enter the storage
tank.
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.7a.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 7a: Tipping gutter mechanism]]
The simpler ideas are based on a manually operated arrangement whereby the inlet pipe is moved away from the tank inlet, and then replaced again once the initial first flush has been diverted. This method has obvious drawbacks
because there has to be a person present who will remember to move the pipe. Other systems use tipping gutters to
achieve the same purpose. The most common system (as shown in Figure 7a) uses a bucket which accepts the first flush and the weight of this water off-balances a tipping gutter which then diverts the water back into the tank. <br>

The bucket then empties slowly through a small-bore pipe and automatically resets. The
process will repeat itself from time to time if the rain continues to fall, which can be a
problem where water is really at a premium. In this case a tap can be fitted to the bucket
and will be operated manually. The quantity of water that is flushed is dependent on the
force required to lift the guttering. This can be adjusted to suit the needs of the user.
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.7b.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 7b: Floating ball first flush system]]
Another system relies on a floating ball that forms a seal once sufficient water has been diverted (see Figure 7b). The seal is made as the ball rises into the apex of an inverted cone. The ball seals the top of the ‘waste’ water chamber and the diverted water is slowly released, as with the bucket system above, through a small bore pipe.
Again, the alternative is to use a tap. In some systems (notably one factory manufactured system from Australia) the
top receiving chamber is designed such that a vortex is formed and any particles in the water are drawn down into the base of the vortex while only clean water passes
into the storage tank. The ‘waste’ water can be used for irrigating garden plants or other suitable application. The debris has to be removed from the lower chamber occasionally. Although the more sophisticated methods provide a much more elegant means of rejecting the first flush water, practitioners often recommend that very simple, easily maintained systems be used, as these are more likely to be repaired if failure occurs.



====Filtration systems and settling tanks====
[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.fig.8.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 8: the WISY filter (downpipe and high-capacity below ground versions)]]
Again, there are a wide variety of systems available
for treating water before, during, and after storage.
The level of sophistication also varies from
extremely high-tech to very rudimentary. A German
company, WISY, have developed an ingenious
filter which fits into a vertical downpipe and acts
as both filter and first-flush system. The filter
(Figure 8) cleverly takes in water through a very
fine (~0.20mm) mesh while allowing silt and
debris to continue down the pipe. The efficiency of
the filter is over 90%. This filter is commonly used
in European systems.

The simple trash rack has been used in some
systems but this type of filter has a number of
associated problems: firstly it only removes large
debris; and secondly the rack can become clogged
easily and requires regular cleaning.

The sand-charcoal-stone filter is often used for filtering rainwater entering a tank. This type
of filter is only suitable, however, where the inflow is slow to moderate, and will soon overflow
if the inflow exceeds the rate at which the water can percolate through the sand. Settling
tanks and partitions can be used to remove silt and other suspended solids from the water.
These are usually effective, but add significant additional cost if elaborate techniques are
used. Many systems found in the field rely simply on a piece of cloth or fine mosquito mesh
to act as the filter (and to prevent mosquitoes entering the tank).
Post storage filtration include such systems as the upflow [[sand filter]] or the twin compartment
candle filters commonly found in developing countries. Many other systems exist and can be
found in the appropriate water literature.



====Sizing the system====
Usually, the main calculation carried out by the designer when planning a domestic RWH
system will be to size the water tank correctly to give adequate storage capacity. The storage
requirement will be determined by a number of interrelated factors. They include:
* local rainfall data and weather patterns
* size of roof (or other) collection area
* runoff coefficient (this varies between 0.5 and 0.9 depending on roof material and slope)
* user numbers and consumption rates
The style of rainwater harvesting i.e. whether the system will provide total or partial supply
(see the next section) will also play a part in determining the system components and their
size.
There are a number of different methods used for sizing the tank. These methods vary in
complexity and sophistication. Some are readily carried out by relatively inexperienced, firsttime
practitioners while others require computer software and trained engineers who
understand how to use the software. The choice of method used to design system
components will depend largely on the following factors:
* the size and sophistication of the system and its components
* the availability of the tools required for using a particular method (e.g. computers)
* the skill and education levels of the practitioner / designer
Outlined below are two different methods for sizing RWH system components.

'''Method 1 : demand side approach'''
A very simple method is to calculate the largest storage requirement based on the consumption rates and occupancy of the building.
As a simple example we can use the following typical data:
* Consumption per capita per day, C = 20 litres
* Number of people per household, n = 6
* Longest average dry period = 25 days
* Daily consumption = C x n = 120 litres
* Storage requirement, T = 120 x 25 = 3,000 litres

This simple method assumes sufficient rainfall and catchment area, and is applicable in
areas where this is the situation. It is a method for acquiring rough estimates of tank size.

'''Method 2 : supply side approach'''
In low rainfall areas or areas where the rainfall is of uneven distribution, more care has to be
taken to size the storage properly. During some months of the year, there may be an excess of water, while at other times there will be a deficit. If there is enough water throughout the
year to meet the demand, then sufficient storage will be required to bridge the periods of
scarcity. As storage is expensive, this should be done carefully to avoid unnecessary expense.
This is a common scenario in many developing countries where monsoon or single wet season
climates prevail.
The example given here is a simple spreadsheet calculation for a site in North Western
Tanzania. The rainfall statistics were collected from a nurse at the local hospital who had
been keeping records for the previous 12 years. Average figures for the rainfall data were
used to simplify the calculation, and no reliability calculation is done. This is a typical field
approach to RWH storage sizing.

The example is taken from a system built at a medical dispensary in the village of Ruganzu,
Biharamulo District, Tanzania.

[[Image:pract.act.rain.water.table.2.jpg]]

It is seen that on the average the daily available rainwater is sufficient to meet the demand.
However, we have to remember that rainfall does not occur uniformly throughout the year. We
must collect and store enough water in the rainy season to last the dry months to ensure
water availability throughout the year. The required volume of the storage tank may be found
by examining monthly rainwater collection potential or supply (based on average monthly
rainfall) against the demand. The cumulative shortfall in the dry months has to be met. In
this example, there is very little rainfall in Jun, July and August and moderate rainfall in May
and September in Tanzania. So we need to store about 115 days demand or about 52 cubic
m (450X115=51,750 L or 51.75 cu m). This is a rough calculation for sizing the storage
tank. Plotting actual rainfall data and demand in a cumulative manner can help in further
refining the tank size.

== Rainwater quality and health ==
There are two main issues when looking at the quality and health aspects of DRWH:
Firstly, there is the issue of bacteriological water quality. Rainwater can become
contaminated by faeces entering the tank from the catchment area. It is advised that the
catchment surface always be kept clean. Rainwater tanks should be designed to protect the
water from contamination by leaves, dust, insects, vermin, and other industrial or agricultural
pollutants. Tanks should be sited away from trees, with good-fitting lids and kept in good
condition. Incoming water should be filtered or screened, or allowed to settle to take out
foreign matter (as described in a previous section). Water which is relatively clean on entry to
the tank will usually improve in quality if allowed to sit for some time inside the tank.
Bacteria entering the tank will die off rapidly if the water is clean. Algae will grow inside a
tank if sufficient sunlight is available for photosynthesis. Keeping a tank dark and sited in a
shady spot will prevent algae growth and also keep the water cool. The area surrounding a
RWH should be kept in good sanitary condition, fenced off to prevent animals fouling the area or children playing around the tank. Any pools of water gathering around the tank should be
drained.
Secondly, there is a need to prevent insect vectors from breeding inside the tank. In areas
where malaria is present, mosquito breeding in the storage tank can cause a major problem.
All tanks should be sealed to prevent insects from entering. Mosquito proof screens should
be fitted to all openings. Some practitioners recommend the use of 1 to 2 teaspoons of
household kerosene in a tank of water which provides a film to prevent mosquitoes settling on
the water.

There are several simple methods of treatment for water before drinking.
* Boiling water will kill any harmful bacteria which may be present
* Adding chlorine in the right quantity (35ml of sodium hypochlorite per 1000 litres of
water) will disinfect the water
* [[Slow sand filtration]] will remove any harmful organisms when carried out properly
* A recently developed technique called SODIS (SOlar DISinfection) utilises plastic bottles
which are filled with water and placed in the sun for one full day. The back of the bottle
is painted black. More information can be found through the Resource Section at the
end of this document.
