'''Welcome to PH:254 -- Introduction to Nanotechnology at Clarion University of Pennsylvania.'''

In the article "Nanotechnology and the Developing World" Fabio Salamanca-Buentello, Deepa L. Persad, Erin B. Court, Douglas K. Martin, Abdallah S. Daar, and Peter A. Singer show that [[nanotechnology]] is an extremely powerful growing collection of tools that can be harnessed to address some of the world's most critical [[sustainable development]] problems.[http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020097&ct=1]

Below find examples under progress
