The RepRap PV system project was a semester project for the class [[MY5970|MY5970/EE5900]] '''Solar Hacking'''. The project consists of designing a solar PV system to power a [[RepRap]] 3-D printer.
==RepRap==
The RepRap is an open-source low cost 3-D printer, which can print small objects out of plastic. What makes it interesting is the community that is already in place and growing for developers on the project.
