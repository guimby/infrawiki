{{Template:Are You Ready? An In-depth Guide to Citizen Preparedness}}
There are actions that should be taken before, during, and after an event that are unique to each hazard. For example:

* <div>Seeking a safe shelter during a tornado.</div>
* <div>Reducing property loss from a hurricane.</div>
Information about the specific hazards and what to do for each is provided in Parts 2, 3, and 4. Study the material for those hazards that you identified in Section 1.1 as the ones that have happened or could happen. Share the hazard-specific information with family members and include pertinent material from these parts in your family disaster plan.
