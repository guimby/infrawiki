The agricultural sector is a driving force in the gas emissions and land use effects thought to cause climate change. In addition to being a significant user of [[land use|land]] and consumer of [[fossil fuel]], agriculture contributes directly to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions through practices such as rice production and the raising of livestock;<ref>[http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN] retrieved 25 June 2007</ref> according to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the three main causes of the increase in greenhouse gases observed over the past 250 years have been fossil fuels, land use, and agriculture.<ref>[http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/wg1-report.html Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]])</ref>

==Land use==

Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas increases through land use in four main ways:
* CO<sub>2</sub> releases linked to [[deforestation]]
* Methane releases from [[rice|rice cultivation]]
* Methane releases from [[enteric fermentation]] in cattle
* [[Nitrous oxide]] releases from [[fertilizer]] application

Together, these agricultural processes comprise 54% of methane emissions, roughly 80% of nitrous oxide emissions, and virtually all carbon dioxide emissions tied to land use.<ref>[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/076.htm Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios] retrieved 26 June 2007</ref>

The planet's major changes to [[land cover]] since 1750 have resulted from [[deforestation]] in [[temperate region]]s: when forests and woodlands are cleared to make room for fields and [[pasture]]s, the [[albedo]] of the affected area increases, which can result in either warming or cooling effects, depending on local conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf|title=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=}}</ref> Deforestation also affects regional [[RuBisCO|carbon reuptake]], which can result in increased concentrations of [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], the dominant greenhouse gas.<ref>[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-ts.pdf IPCC Technical Summary] retrieved 25 June 2007</ref> Land-clearing methods such as [[slash and burn]] compound these effects by burning [[biomatter]], which directly releases greenhouse gases and particulate matter such as [[soot]] into the air.

== Livestock ==

Livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices are responsible for over 18%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1B9LQQkm_qMC|title=Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|first1=Henning|last1=Steinfeld|first2=Pierre|last2=Gerber|first3=T. D.|last3=Wassenaar|first4=Vincent|last4=Castel|first5=Cees de|last5=Haan|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Food & Agriculture Org.|via=Google Books}}</ref> of human-made greenhouse gas emissions, including:
* 9% of global [[carbon dioxide]] emissions
* 35–40% of global [[methane]] emissions (chiefly due to [[enteric fermentation]] and [[manure]])
* 64% of global nitrous oxide emissions (chiefly due to [[fertilizer]] use.<ref>[http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N.] retrieved 25 June 2007</ref>)

Livestock activities also contribute disproportionately to land-use effects, since crops such as [[Maize|corn]] and [[alfalfa]] are cultivated in order to feed the animals.

In 2010, [[enteric fermentation]] accounted for 43% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural activity in the world.<ref>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2013) [http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3107e/i3107e00.htm "FAO STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2013 World Food and Agriculture"].

Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the Earth.<ref>[http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N.] retrieved 27 June 2007</ref>

At a global scale, the FAO has recently estimated that livestock (including poultry) accounts for about 14.5 percent of [[anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions]] estimated as 100-year CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.<ref name=Gerber2013>Gerber, P. J., H. Steinfeld, B. Henderson, A. Mottet, C. Opio, J. Dijkman, A. Falcucci and G. Tempio.  2013.  Tackling climate change through livestock - a global assessmaent of emissions and mitigation opportunities.  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome. 115 pp.</ref>  A previous, widely cited FAO report using somewhat more comprehensive analysis had estimated 18 percent.<ref name=Steinfeld2006/> Because this emission percentage includes contributions associated with livestock used for production of draft power, eggs, wool and dairy products, the percentage attributable to meat production alone is significantly lower, as indicated by the report's data.  The indirect effects contributing to the percentage include emissions associated with production of feed consumed by livestock and carbon dioxide emission from deforestation in Central and South America, attributed to livestock production. Using a different sectoral assignment of emissions, the IPCC ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]) has estimated that agriculture (including not only livestock, but also food crop, biofuel and other production) accounted for about 10 to 12 percent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) in 2005<ref>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2007.  Climate change 2007, Mitigation of climate change.  [[Fourth Assessment Report]]</ref> and in 2010.<ref name=IPCC2014>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2014.  Climate change 2014, Mitigation of climate change. [[Fifth Assessment Report]].</ref>

In the US, [[methane]] emissions associated with [[ruminant]] livestock (6.4 Mt in 2013)<ref name=USEPA2015>US Environmental Protection Agency. 2015. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, 1990-2013.  EPA 430-R-15-004.</ref>  are estimated to have declined by about 17 percent from 1980 through 2012.<ref name=FAOSTAT/> Globally, [[enteric fermentation]] (mostly in ruminant livestock) accounts for about 27 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions,<ref name=IPCC2013>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  2013.  Climate change 2013, The physical science basis. Fifth Assessment Report.</ref> and methane accounts for about 32 to 40 percent of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) as tabulated by the IPCC.<ref name=IPCC2014/> Methane has a global warming potential recently estimated as 35 times that of an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide.<ref name=IPCC2013/>  However, despite the magnitude of methane emissions (recently about 330 to 350 Tg per year from all anthropogenic sources), methane’s current effect on global warming is quite small. This is because degradation of methane nearly keeps pace with emissions, resulting in relatively little increase in atmospheric methane content (average of 6 Tg per year from 2000 through 2009), whereas [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] content has been increasing greatly (average of nearly 15,000 Tg per year from 2000 through 2009).<ref name=IPCC2013/>

Mitigation options for reducing methane emission from ruminant enteric fermentation include genetic selection, immunization, rumen [[defaunation]], diet modification and grazing management, among others.<ref>Boadi, D. 2004.

In [[New Zealand]], nearly half of [anthropogenic] greenhouse gas emission is associated with agriculture, which plays a major role in the nation’s economy, and a large fraction of this is assignable to the [[meat industry|livestock industry]].<ref>Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting Feasibility Study. 2. Agricultural sector GHG emissions in NZ.   http://maxa.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/slm/vggr/page-01.htm</ref>  Some fraction of this is assignable to meat production:   FAO data indicate that meat accounted for about 7 percent of product tonnage from [[New Zealand's livestock]] (including poultry) in 2010.<ref name=FAOSTAT/>  Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, according to [[US EPA]] figures compiled using [[UNFCCC]] methodologies.<ref>US EPA.  2009.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990-2007.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  410 pp.</ref>  Not all forms of meat and animal–based foods affect the environment equally. One study estimates that [[red meats]] are 150% more greenhouse gas intensive than chicken or fish.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = C. L. | last2 = Matthews | first2 = H.
