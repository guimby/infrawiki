== Why native organisms ? ==
Native organisms can be expected to fit the [[ecology]] of the region, and be able to grow in the [[climate]] and [[soil]] of the region. They can also play an important role in reducing the [[Food distribution|distance food needs to travel]]. However, native organisms may not always be as productive as the more popular domesticated counterparts or attain equally high prices. The latter is often a result of being not well known (and thus disliked) by the population (at least at first). 

Native organisms should always be considered in [[aquaculture]] as they are generally hardier and thus [[food security|safer organisms]] in terms of providing food (especially today, with global warming affecting the environment). They are however not the most appropriate choice in some situations. Especially where unwanted propagation, and contact to the outside environment can be reduced/eliminated (ie use in water tanks, ponds entirely secluded from the sea, ...), non-indigenous organisms may be a suitable option.

Note that although the amount of marine organisms is much greater than what is mentioned in the list, we only specify species here that are usable for [[aquaculture]]. Most types of organisms can not be kept in captivity (ie they may have very specific needs, are very susceptible to stress, sea lice, oxygen fluctuations in the water, water quality, ..)

Also note that on the map below, the amount of plankton per region is marked. Although many organisms grown in aquaculture do not/can not consume plankton, it is often still possible to use the locally available plankton to feed the organisms we grow. This, by also growing another organism (that can be fed on plankton) and use this as food for the organisms we grow. We can btw also process waste (ie feces) of organisms we grow and use this to grow halofytes as food for other organisms. These methods allow far more cost-efficient production, and also decrease pressure on the environment. See [[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]].

==Types of native organisms by region==

===Type of organisms indicated in this article===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Fish: abbreviation F_ followed by a number to indicate the region. Also includes fish grown for roe
|-
|Shellfish: abbreviation SF_ followed by a number to indicate the region. Shellfish includes crustaceans and molluscs; echinoderms are also included in this category
|-
|Halofytes: abbreviation H_ followed by a number to indicate the region. These crops are either coastal crops (so growing on land, but capable of being flooded or sprayed with salt water, ie Salicornia {{W|Salicornia}} ), floating plants (which live in deeper water yet which head their flower heads come above water and also still have their roots in the ground, ie Nuphar lutea {{W|Nuphar lutea}}),  submerged (rooted) plants (which are entirely submerged yet are rooted in soil, ...; ie coral, most seaweed), or submerged (not-rooted) plants (which are entirely submerged and are not rooted in soil, ... ; ie most algae)

==Notes==
* Marine eels (such as whitespotted conger, ...) have not been included as they are not yet bred in captivity, and as a result are now in danger of becoming extinct. They can be included later-on, once the breeding issue has been resolved. 
* Certain submerged plants can also provide extra oxygen to the water, allowing (certain) fish to survive if planted in the area, even if the water had low amounts of in oxygen; see [[Treatment_ponds]].
* In certain situations, it is possible to place seaweed and/or other marine farms in such a way that it obstructs areas behind the farm, preventing fishing at that location. This method could allow the creation of places where (the still young) fish can hide, a bit similar to mangroves. Off course, fishing should then also not be exerciced by the owner of the marine farm.
