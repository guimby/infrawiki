==Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise==

[http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/sge/ The Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise] (CSGE) is one of [http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/research/ two centers of research, learning, and practice] in the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. The CSGE aims to create innovative research and teaching programs to generate and disseminate cutting-edge ways for private [[enterprise]]s to achieve unparalleled financial success. The CSGE views [[sustainable enterprise]] as a management approach that frames social and environmental challenges as unmet market needs that can be addressed through business solutions. 

This straightforward approach enables the Johnson School to build robust MBA and executive programs in business and sustainability based on [[innovation]] and [[entrepreneurship]]. This sets it apart from most other management programs focused on corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental management, ethical decision making, values-based management, and philanthropy. <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.johnson.cornell.edu/sge/ | title = Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise | accessdate = 2007-11-10}}</ref>
