'''Why 3-D Printing?''' A recent report from data company Wanted Analytics found that in one month [https://www.wantedanalytics.com/analysis/posts/demand-for-3d-printing-skills-soars?utm_source=Google%2B&utm_medium=Google%2B&utm_campaign=9_4_2014_3DPrinting 35 percent of engineering job listings] from a variety of fields, including biomedical, software, and transportation industries, required applicants familiar with 3-D printing.[http://theinstitute.ieee.org/career-and-education/career-guidance/thirtyfive-percent-of-engineering-jobs-now-require-3d-printing-skills] Forbes explains why [http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/03/31/2015-roundup-of-3d-printing-market-forecasts-and-estimates 3D printing is such a big deal]. 

'''Why open source?''' You will make more money, because OS is more valuable. Recent analysis shows that jobs with the keywords "Microsoft Windows" have an average salary of $64,000, while jobs with the keyword "Linux" have an average salary of $99,000.

==Course Description==
This course provides an introduction to distributed additive manufacturing using open-source 3-D printing. First this course will provide an overview of open-source hardware and technological development in theory and practice. Both the use of software and user communities will be highlighted and demonstrated. Next, the course will detail the design, use and maintenance of the open-source electronics behind the development of self-replicating rapid prototypers. Then the technological evolution of the open-source 3-D printing technology will be covered with a focus on developing innovation for improved performance and materials selection. '''Each student will build a customized RepRap''' and the course will cover hardware, firmware, slicing and printer controller software for operating and maintaining the device. Finally the material properties, applications and ramifications of RepRap technology will be discussed.

The course is meant for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in Materials Science & Engineering, and Electrical & Computer Engineering, while students in other areas of engineering or science with a strong interest in this topic are also welcomed. Graduate students are expected to complete all coursework assigned to the undergraduates and an in depth project.

'''Credits''': 3.0
'''Lec-Rec-Lab''': (3-0-[0-3]), (3 lecture hours and 0-3 lab hours)

===Required Course Material===
[[image:OSL.jpg|thumb|left]] '''There is a $500 course fee for this course.''' This fee will be used to purchase a [[Athena_Build_Overview|MOST Delta RepRap 2]] kit for you to use during the course. At the end of the course you keep the printer you built and modified. The design will be somewhat like the image above - but note that it is a rapidly evolving technology so by Fall the design will have improved.

Textbook: J.M. Pearce, ''The Open-Source Lab'' (Elsevier,2014). Other reading will be handouts in class, on-line reading, and emailed pdfs. See hyperlinks in schedule.

===Course Organization===
This course will be run as an intense seminar meeting as a group. Students will be expected to read the course material before class and actively participate in discussions. The majority of class time will be spent on projects in a flipped class format. Each student will be responsible for building a RepRap 3-D printer to use to complete the projects. Students will be responsible for giving short presentations on their projects on each sub-topic in front of the class at the end of the semester.

Graduate students will take the same lecture and projects as the undergraduates, however, they will also be expected to complete a significant improvement to the RepRap design by the end of the semester. They will demonstrate their mods for the class.

===Learning Objectives===

*Learn the fundamentals of additive manufacturing (AM) and 3-D printing with polymers, along with those for emerging materials (e.g., metals, ceramics, flexible materials, nanocomposites, biomaterials) and complex architectures.
*Learn the fundamentals of free and open source hardware (FOSH) design, licensing, and culture.
*Understand and demonstrate the fabrication, maintenance, trouble shooting and operation of self-replicating rapid prototype (RepRap) 3-D printers.
*Understand operating principles, capabilities, and limitations of fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based 3-D printing.
*Understand the principles of "Design for 3-D printing" and compare and contrast additive processes with conventional manufacturing in terms of rate, quality, cost, environmental impact, social control and flexibility.
*Gain hands-on experience with RepRap 3-D printers; use these machines to fabricate example parts of increasing complexity, post-process the parts, and study the results.
*Become familiar with the complete workflow of open source AM, including computational design tools, firmware, software, file formats, toolpath generation, and characterization.
*Understand how to make a new part and alter an existing part for RepRap 3-D printing for custom applications.
*Study applications of distributed manufacturing using 3-D printing including consumer products, scientific equipment, and appropriate technology.
*Place open source 3-D printing in the context of the evolving distributed manufacturing infrastructure.
