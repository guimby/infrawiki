Seedling pots can be easily made from paper rolls after the products have been used. The benefit of these pots is that they can be planted straight into the ground when the seedlings are ready to be planted out in the garden and left there. The paper will biodegrade into the soil and the plant will happily grow in its chosen place.

== Making the seedling pots ==

# Find suitable paper rolls. Suitable rolls for making seedling pots include toilet paper rolls, kitchen paper towel rolls and gift wrapping rolls. Provided the paper/cardboard roll is not dyed, then it can be used. Keep a stash of such rolls just prior to the time you need to grow seedlings, so that you have enough.
# Cut the paper roll into suitable sizes. For example, if you're using a toilet paper roll, just cut it in half. This half size is the size to aim for, whatever source the cardboard roll. Use a craft knife or scissors for cutting the roll.
# Cut four slits in even places at one end of the roll piece, making each slit about 2 to 2.5cm up the roll. Bend the slit pieces inward and over each other to form the base. If needed, add a small piece of tape to keep the pot base in place.
# Fill halfway or so with soil. Add the seed, then cover with more soil.
# Grow the seeds into seedlings. When the seedlings are ready to be transplanted, simply plop the whole container into the ground. Before placing in the soil, undo the base so that the base is open to the soil, allowing the roots to grow down into the garden soil.

== Tips ==
*The seedling pots can be rested on a tray, plate or other waterproof surface that can be carried around with ease. This allows you to shift the seedlings to warmer and sunnier areas as needed and makes it easier to take the seedlings out as a batch for transplanting.
