==Problem being addressed==
Cephalopelvic disproportion is the primary mechanism of obstructed labor, and essentially is when there is a mismatch between the fetal skull and the womanâ€™s pelvis. Women that typically experience this condition suffer from an improperly developed pelvis due to poor nutrition, young age of motherhood, and/or bone-affecting disease. If left untreated, CPD leaves women vulnerable to postpartum hemorrhage, ruptured uterus, stillbirth, fistula formation, and sepsis.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This device is a simple, 3 query tool  that allows health workers to determine if a woman is at a high or low risk for CPD during the early stages of the pregnancy. The tool is the first device that can predict obstructed labor before it starts. This CPD risk-stratifying tool is low cost and can be used effectively by low-literacy community health workers.
