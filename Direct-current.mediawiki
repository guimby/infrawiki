'''Direct current''' (DC or "continuous current") is the unidirectional flow of [[electric]] charge. Direct current is produced by such sources as batteries, thermocouples, solar cells, and commutator-type electric machines of the dynamo type. Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also be through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. In direct current, the electric charges flow in the same direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for direct current was Galvanic current.

[[Alternating current]] (AC) and direct current (DC) are the 2 main types of currents used in electrical circuits.
