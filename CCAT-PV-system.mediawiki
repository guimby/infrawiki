=Current System=
The CCAT solar photovoltaic system has gone through many changes over the years that it has been used. This section describes the current setup as of Spring 2014.

==Design==
The current rooftop PV system is set up with 8 ASE Americas ASE-300-DGF/17 solar panels connected in series. They are connected to one Aurora 3600-US-OUT inverter. Magnetek used to own the Aurora inverters, but now Power One owns them. The manual for the inverter can be found at [http://www.power-one.com/sites/power-one.com/files/documents/renewable-energy/tech-manual/manual_installation_pvi-3600-us.pdf Power One's website]. The specifications sheet for the solar panels can be found at [http://www.pvsolar.com/rwe/ase17-285.html PV Solar's website]. Below is a simple diagram of the current system layout.

==Project Purpose==


This page describes the history of the [[Photovoltaics| photovoltaic system]](PV) installed on the roof of [[CCAT]] (Campus Center for Appropriate Technology) at [[Humboldt State University]] (HSU). The PV system harnesses a renewable source of energy to generate electricity for the CCAT house. This project is sponsored by the [[Humboldt Energy Independence Fund]] (HEIF), an entirely student funded organization. 
The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology is a student run organization focusing on renewable, environmental and self-sustainable technology.  CCAT is a live-in demonstration house and educational center on HSU campus.<ref>http://www.ccathsu.com/renewableenergy/HomePwr_Aug02_CCAT_PV.pdf</ref>

==About CCAT==

CCAT is a student-initiated, student-run, and student funded demonstration home at Humboldt State University, dedicated to resource and energy-efficient living. The Center was started in 1978. Today, CCAT is a thriving household and educational center that has been integrated into the University’s curriculum. People contact CCAT from around the world, seeking information on sustainable living techniques. Locally, CCAT is a demonstration home showing appropriate technology in action. It provides tours, workshops, and
experiential learning opportunities to the local community. CCAT’s solar and other systems have been featured in HP32 and HP43.

==Background==


In May of 1991, CCAT installed a [[PV]] solar system. This system ran off the grid for 10 years generating power for the CCAT house along with a [[wind turbine]] and backup bio diesel generator. In 2001, a new grid tied PV system of 8 ASE-300-DGF/17 modules of 300 Watts each. This system ran for only a few years before the CCAT house was moved several hundred feet to the southwest to make room for the BSS building at HSU in 2005. It has since been reconnected in 2008 and is still grid tied.

==PV Definition==


[[Photovoltaics]] is the direct conversion of light into electricity at the atomic level. Some materials exhibit a property known as the photoelectric effect that causes them to absorb photons of light and release electrons. When these free electrons are captured, an electric current results that can be used as electricity.

The photoelectric effect was first noted by a French physicist, Edmund Bequerel, in 1839, who found that certain materials would produce small amounts of electric current when exposed to light. In 1905, Albert Einstein described the nature of light and the photoelectric effect on which photovoltaic technology is based. He later won a Nobel prize in physics for this work. The first photovoltaic module was built by Bell Laboratories in 1954. It was billed as a solar battery and was mostly just a curiosity as it was too expensive to gain widespread use. In the 1960s, the space industry began to make the first serious use of the technology to provide power aboard spacecraft. Through the space programs, the technology advanced, its reliability was established, and the cost began to decline. During the energy crisis in the 1970s, photovoltaic technology gained recognition as a source of power for non-space applications.

[[Image:SCAN0059.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Fig 1: PV Panels]]

Solar cells are made of the same kinds of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, used in the microelectronics industry. For solar cells, a thin semiconductor wafer is specially treated to form an electric field, positive on one side and negative on the other. When light energy strikes the solar cell, electrons are knocked loose from the atoms in the semiconductor material. If electrical conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides, forming an electrical circuit, the electrons can be captured in the form of an electric current -- that is, electricity. This electricity can then be used to power a load, such as a light or a tool.

A number of solar cells electrically connected to each other and mounted in a support structure or frame is called a photovoltaic module. Modules are designed to supply electricity at a certain voltage, such as a common 12 volts system. The current produced is directly dependent on how much light strikes the module.
[[Image:SCAN0060.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 2: Presentation of System]]
Multiple modules can be wired together to form an array. In general, the larger the area of a module or array, the more electricity that will be produced. Photovoltaic modules and arrays produce direct-current (dc) electricity. They can be connected in both series and parallel electrical arrangements to produce any required voltage and current combination.

Today's most common PV devices use a single junction, or interface, to create an electric field within a semiconductor such as a PV cell. In a single-junction PV cell, only photons whose energy is equal to or greater than the band gap of the cell material can free an electron for an electric circuit. In other words, the photovoltaic response of single-junction cells is limited to the portion of the sun's spectrum whose energy is above the band gap of the absorbing material, and lower-energy photons are not used. <ref>http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2002/solarcells/</ref>

==History==

Originally conceived by Jim Zoellick, the CCAT PV system has been designed as a working demonstration of solar energy production for the many visitors to the CCAT house.  Electrical energy use and PV production are documented on a dry erase board....(missing page)

==The Old Stand-Alone System==

The old stand-alone PV system at CCAT consisted of
22 Solec International photovoltaic panels, a Whisper
wind turbine, and a backup generator. The PVs were
donated in the 1980s from the Flat Plate Array Project
at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
The output from the 22 panel array was about 700 watts
peak on a sunny summer day. The Whisper H500 wind
turbine, standing 43 feet (13 m) tall and using a World
Power control box, generated very little, due to the site’s
poor wind energy potential. Part of the problem was that
the surrounding trees had grown considerably since the
original wind generator was first installed on that tower
in 1984.
Energy generated during the day was stored in a 24 volt
battery bank consisting of twelve, Trojan L-16 batteries.
A Trace C40 charge controller regulated the battery
voltage during charging. Twelve volt DC loads were
supplied via a Vanner battery equalizer, and AC loads
were supplied using a Trace SW4024 inverter. A
biodiesel engine generator was used to charge the
battery bank as needed.
The solar-electric modules from the old system are now
being used for learning opportunities at CCAT. Students
in a variety of classes and workshops will have a
chance to wire up the panels and test their output.

==The New Grid-Connected System==

Design of the new system was
centered around a generous
donation of eight, large area (4 x 6
foot; 1.2 x 1.8 m) modules from ASE
Americas, Inc. The modules, model
number ASE-300-DGF/17, are each
rated at 300 W at standard test
conditions (STC). STC are an
irradiance of 1,000 watts per square
meter, and a cell temperature of
25°C (77°F).
These are 12 volt nominal modules,
with a rated maximum power point
voltage of 17.2 V. 

Four of these
modules wired in series create a
roughly 1 KW, 48 V building block for
a grid-connected system (derated by 12 percent from STC rating to better represent PV
output under normal operating conditions at our
location). CCAT's team planned to use two series strings of four
modules each, giving us a 48 V, 2 KW system.
The first and biggest design decision was to choose an
inverter for the system. CCAT already owned a Trace
SW4024 inverter that had been used in the stand-alone
PV system, they considered this as a prime
candidate. It is rated for grid-tied applications, and has
more than enough capacity to handle the total rated
array output of 2,400 W.

Most Trace SW series inverters require at
least a small battery bank. CCAT wanted to put in a system
that set a good example for other potential grid connected
PV adopters. Unless you have a serious need for backup power , it doesn’t make sense to install a grid-connected
system with battery backup.
Batteries complicate PV systems. They add significantly
to system cost. They need to be maintained regularly
and replaced periodically. And they add significant
inefficiencies to the system. In most places, the grid is
not down very often or for very long, so batteries add no
benefit most of the time.

After they spoke with an engineer at Trace, and studied
the capabilities of the Trace SW4024, including the
adjustable software settings such as float voltage, sell
mode voltage, and grid usage timer, they decided against
this option. This inverter is simply not optimized for PV
systems installed in grid-connected applications. When
the PVs are not charging, this inverter constantly float
charges the batteries with electricity from the grid.
At best, with a minimum sized battery bank capacity of
100 AH (per Trace specifications), they expected to lose
at least a few hundred watt-hours per day and perhaps
as much as 1 to 2 KWH per day due to battery charging.
That was simply unacceptable to them. It represented a
system efficiency loss of anywhere from 5 to 25 percent.
They did consider adding a voltage-controlled relay
system that would connect the inverter to the grid only
when the PVs were charging, thereby minimizing any
battery charging from the grid. They decided against this
because it would complicate the system and make it
less representative of a standard grid-connected
system. In addition, the SW4024 does not offer
maximum power point tracking, and would require
charge controllers to provide battery overcharge
protection in the event of a grid failure.
The team also considered the Trace Sun Tie ST2500. This is a
utility-interactive inverter that does not require any
batteries. However, Trace has had some serious
problems with the maximum power point tracking
feature in the Sun Tie series inverters. After they talked to
Trace and other experts in the field about the problem,
they decided that they were not willing to take a risk with a
Trace Sun Tie unit.
This left only one other option for a California Energy
Commission (CEC) certified utility-interactive inverter
that was configured to accept 48 VDC input. This was
the GC-1000 manufactured by Advanced Energy. This
inverter came highly recommended from a couple of our
industry contacts. It is rated at 1 KW single-phase 120
VAC output, features maximum power point tracking,
and has a peak efficiency of 93 percent.
One of these inverters is a good match with four, 12 volt
nominal ASE Americas 300 W modules wired in series,so we chose to use two of these inverters.We contacted
Advanced Energy and they generously agreed to
donate two refurbished GC-1000 inverters, along with a
data monitoring system for our demonstration project.
Since the majority of our equipment was donated, the team
did not apply for CEC buydown funds. However, they still
decided to use equipment that was certified by the CEC.
The Advanced Energy inverter is well accepted, and CCAT
wanted their electric utility to approve the equipment
without question.

==New System Description==

Each of the two inverters is independently connected to
four PV modules wired in series. The inverters are
factory-equipped with a 25 A breaker, a 30 A fuse and
ground-fault protection on the DC input.They have a 15 A
breaker, 15 A fuse, and surge arrestor on the AC output.
The hot legs of the two inverter AC outputs are switched
using a PG&E approved, 30 A, double pole disconnect
switch. This is a lockable, visible disconnect switch,
mounted alongside the main service panel next to
PG&E’s meter, and meets PG&E’s interconnection
requirements.
[[Image:CCATs PV System Drawing.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 3 CCATs PV System Drawing]]
The AC output from each inverter is wired
to a 30 A breaker in the main service panel.
The CCAT roof is conveniently oriented due south, with
a slope of 26.5 degrees from horizontal. At our Arcata
latitude of 41 degrees north, the roof slope falls just
within a recommended array slope of ±15 degrees of
our latitude. In addition, analysis of Arcata solar
insolation data (obtained from the National Solar
Radiation Database) indicates that the annual amount
of insolation received on a sloped surface in Arcata is
nearly identical for slopes ranging from 20 to 40
degrees.
With this background information, we chose to mount
the PV modules parallel to the slope of the roof, using
the Schott Applied Power (formerly Ascension
Technology) pitched RoofJack mounting system. A
junction box, also purchased from Schott Applied
Power, mounts to the center RoofJack. It contains 30 A
fuses, and serves as a combiner box where we
terminate the array leads and start our DC wire run,
enclosed in conduit, to the inverters. (See the system
schematic.)

==CCAT Electrical Loads==

The electrical loads at CCAT vary with the seasons. In
general, energy use is higher when school is in session due to an increase in activity. Loads include fluorescent
lights, stereos, computers, power tools, and other
miscellaneous equipment. During the summer, CCAT runs a
Sun Frost refrigerator, while the other eight months of
the year they use a cold box with a natural convection
cycle to keep food cold. A variety of pedal-powered
appliances, such as a TV and a blender, also help to
conserve electricity.
As CCAT continues to expand and demonstrate
alternatives for living lightly, new energy demands
sometimes arise. For example, CCAT recently joined
efforts with the campus recycling program to greatly
reduce food waste on the HSU campus. The project
involves use of an electrically driven shredder that
prepares the food waste to enter an industrial-sized
vermicompost (worm) bin capable of handling up to 150
pounds (68 kg) a day. The bin itself also requires
electricity to run a motorized unit that forces the finished
compost out of the bin for collection.
Their best estimate of our itemized electrical use is in the
load table. CCAT's actual usage between October 2001 and
April 2002 averaged 1.9 KWH per day, which agrees
closely with their estimate. (*Update with current usage)

==Net Metering Rate Options==

After adjusting for an expected array operating
temperature of 122°F (50°C) and an average inverter
efficiency of 84 percent, the new grid-connected PV system is expected to provide approximately 1.8 KW of
peak AC power. Given their annual average of about four
peak sun hours per day in Arcata, they expect an average
daily energy output of 7.2 KWH. This is well beyond
CCAT’s current energy needs of 1.9 KWH per day, so
the system should produce a significant excess of solar
electricity.
The PV system is definitely oversized. It would not be a
cost effective design for the typical homeowner because
PG&E won’t pay for any excess electrical generation. If
you’re running a net metered system in California, the
best you can do is net your energy cost to zero on an
annual basis and pay the utility’s minimum monthly
charge. In PG&E territory, this amounts to US$5 each
month. Most of CCAT's equipment was donated, so it did not
cost them any extra for the excess clean solar electricity
they feed into the grid.
This results in a modest benefit to the
environment and, inadvertently, to
PG&E’s pocketbook. They’re looking
forward to the day when the utilities
are required to pay a premium rate
for excess electricity generated using
renewable resources. They could sell
this electricity through their green
power programs.
CCAT's rate options for net metering
included the standard residential
rate, or the residential time-of-use
(TOU) rate. CCAT considered both of
these options. The TOU rate would
have required installation of a TOU
meter at a cost of US$277. Because 
they generate an excess of solar
electricity, the TOU rate will not
benefit them. It’s a different situation for residential PG&E customers
whose electricity usage is primarily during the evening
and weekend periods (people who work during the
daytime and minimize their phantom loads). The TOU
rate can allow them to install a smaller PV system and
still reduce their electricity bill to the minimum US$5
service charge. This is because the TOU rate puts a
higher value on electricity used or generated during the
summer peak hours. The optimal way to minimize your
bill is to have electricity costs exactly cancel out
electricity “revenues” on an annual basis.
The summer peak period for TOU customers is May 1
through October 31 from noon to 6 PM, Monday
through Friday. Peak usage during this period is driven
by the high cooling load in much of California. During
this period, the TOU rate is about US32¢ per KWH.
During the winter peak period, the TOU rate is about
US12¢ per KWH, and during the off-peak periods it is
about US9¢ per KWH. So, if most of your energy usage
is during the off-peak periods and a substantial amount
of your PV electricity is generated during the peak
periods, you can significantly decrease the optimal size
of your PV system (and the associated capital costs).
For example, they have estimated that a PV system
facing due south at a slope of 41 degrees in Arcata will
generate approximately 27 percent of its annual energy
production during the summer peak period, and another
17 percent during the winter peak period. Assuming you
are on the TOU rate and use all of your electricity during
the off-peak periods, this would allow you to decrease
the size of your PV array by 41 percent.
With an average daily electrical usage of 10 KWH per
day on the standard rate, you would need about a 2.9 KW system (rated at STC) to net your electricity cost to
zero and thereby lower your bill to the US$5 minimum
per month. On the TOU rate, you could decrease your
system size to 1.7 KW, and still limit your bill to US$5
per month.

==Module Testing==

Because CCAT is part of a university, they have an interest
in testing and evaluating systems. They made sure not to
miss this opportunity with their new system. CCAT
measured individual current versus voltage curves (I-V
curves) for each of the eight ASE modules prior to
installation.
Although the donated ASE modules were reportedly
manufacturer’s "leftovers" due to cosmetic defects, they
performed remarkably well. Their measurements showed
that module output was within 1 percent of the
manufacturer’s measurements supplied with the
modules, and within 2 percent of their nameplate rating.
ASE uses a plus or minus 4 percent tolerance for rating
the output of their PVs. Most other PV manufacturers
use a plus or minus 10 percent tolerance rating. CCAT
thinks that ASE’s truth in advertising is laudable. ASE
sets a high standard for rating the output of their PVs.
CCAT hopes that the other module manufacturers will follow
suit.
The I-V curves were generated in ambient sunlight in
Arcata, California near midday in June 2001, using an
electronic DC load device. As the load was varied, the
module traversed its operating curve from short circuit
current to open circuit voltage. During the tests, CCAT also
measured the radiation incident in the plane of the
module as well as the module operating temperature.
These measurements were then used to standardize
the performance curves to STC. (See the module I-V
curve.)

==System Installation==

For a number of reasons, CCAT took a team approach to
system installation. The CCAT house is an old structure,
and the AC electrical wiring needed some work to bring
it up to code before they could reconnect to PG&E. CCAT
had Peter Brant, a local electrical contractor, perform
this work. While he was at it, the team had him install the AC disconnect for the PV system, prepare the AC panel for
interconnection, and run the AC wiring from the inverter
room to the AC disconnect.
CCAT had Bob-O Schultze, a solar-electric contractor, run
the DC wire and conduit, assist with the inverter and PV
module installation, and ensure that our installation was
code compliant. They installed the array mounting
structure, PV modules, and inverters themselves, with
help from students in a PV Design and Installation class
offered through the Environmental Resources
Engineering Department at HSU. The equipment we
chose allowed for a rather quick and easy installation
procedure.
[[Image:SCAN0063.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Fig.4 Final adjustments]]
The RoofJack mounting system is designed for pitched
asphalt shingle roofs like CCAT’s. It supports the
modules about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above and parallel to
the roof, allowing for adequate air circulation between
the modules and the roof to promote module cooling.
The RoofJacks came complete with self-drilling
fasteners (21/4 inch, #12) and sealing washers,
preapplied butyl-rubber sealing pads, and pipe nipples
for wire pass-through between modules.
Their eight, large area modules were installed in one
continuous row. Each module is supported by four
RoofJacks, one placed near each of the module’s four
corners. There are two types of RoofJacks—end and
interior. They used four end RoofJacks at the extremities
of the array. A pair of shared interior RoofJacks support
the module edges that are located next to other
modules, for a total of 14 interior RoofJacks.
To properly locate the RoofJacks on the roof, they built a
jig with the bolt hole pattern for one set of RoofJacks.
After installing the first set, CCAT simply moved the jig over
and installed the next set, and so on. According to the
manufacturer, securing the RoofJacks directly to the
sheathing (a minimum of 5/8 inch; 16 mm thickness) is
adequate, but they felt that it was prudent to add
reinforcement. The team located the array on the roof so that
four of the interior RoofJacks were secured directly to
two rafters. To secure the remaining RoofJacks, they
either scabbed 2 by 4 blocks to a rafter or added strips
of plywood sheathing on the underside of the roof
sheathing to provide a more secure attachment.
Once the RoofJacks were installed, the modules were
outfitted with their mounting bolts. Four bolts were
attached to each module, two on each side near the
corners. These bolts protrude about 1/2 inch (13 mm)
with a sleeve. To install the modules, they simply lifted
them into place and slid the four mounting bolts into
slots on the RoofJacks.
Wiring the array was just as easy. CCAT's system consists
of two separate subarrays, each comprised of four
modules wired in series and connected to an inverter.
The first set of four modules in the row make up one
subarray, and the second set of modules make up the
second subarray.
[[Image:SCAN0062.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 4 Panels located on roof of CCAT house]]
CCAT mounted the array combiner box in the center of the
row of eight modules between the two arrays. This box
houses fusing for the arrays, and provides a place to terminate our array wiring before
running wire to the inverters.
The wiring between modules was
provided by the module
manufacturer, and came equipped
with weatherproof connectors
designed for series wiring of
modules. Once the modules were in
place, they simply snapped these
connectors together, added their solid
copper grounding wire between
modules, and terminated these wires
in the combiner box.
CCAT wall mounted the Advanced
Energy GC-1000 inverters in a room
in the basement that has historically
been used to house PV system
equipment. The inverters came with
PV string combiner boards. These
were sized to handle up to six
individual strings rated at 10 amps
each. However, they had a single
module string with a short circuit
current rating of 19.1 A, so the team
removed this board. It was a little
tricky to figure out how to wire the
inverters without it and still use the
GFI protection and AC and DC
circuit breakers that were provided
with the units.
After examining the units and speaking with the
manufacturer, they found that they could wire the DC input
directly to the DC breaker, bypassing the combiner
board while still using the other features. AC surge
arrestors were supplied with the units. Since they are not
in a lightning prone area, the inverter manufacturer
suggested that DC surge protection was unnecessary.
In addition to donating the inverters, Advanced Energy
included their AM100 Inverter Monitor. This unit monitors
up to six inverters, and features an LCD display and a
four-button keypad as a user interface. It logs DC
current, DC voltage, AC current, AC voltage, AC power
output, inverter efficiency, and cumulative AC energy
output. When it collects data at 15 minute intervals, the
AM100 is able to store about 30 days worth of data.
The data is downloadable via a serial communication
port. To access the data, Advanced Energy provides
their PVMON software that runs on any DOS or
Windows-based personal computer. Data files are
stored in Excel compatible (.CSV), comma delimited
format. A single data file is recorded for each day. The
data is easy to download and access.

==System Performance==


The new grid-connected PV system first started
generating on October 17, 2001. Of the 901 KWH total
solar-electric energy generated as of April 23, 2002,
358 KWH were used on-site, and the other 543 KWH
were fed back into the PG&E grid. During this period,
they averaged 1.9 KWH per day of electrical energy use,
while the PV system generated an average of 4.8 KWH
per day.
[[Image:SCAN0061.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Fig. 5 Panels in action]]
Data for about a one-month period in mid-February to
mid-March of 2002 was examined to evaluate the
performance of the system. During this period, the PV
system generated an average of 4.9 KWH per day. The
maximum AC power output was 1,745 W, with a
corresponding maximum DC input power of 2,155 W
(81 percent average inverter efficiency). The inverters,
with a rated peak efficiency of 93 percent, averaged 83
percent and 85 percent, respectively. About 99 percent
of the time, the input voltage to the inverters was within
their maximum power point tracking range of 55 to 70
VDC. Inverter efficiency varies as a function of AC
power output. (See the inverter efficiency plot.)
The highest points in the graph are clearly aberrations
in the data. However, there are over 1,400 total data
points, of which only 30 show efficiencies greater than
96 percent. In all cases, these abnormally high
efficiency readings are recorded at very low power
outputs (always less than 171 W).
Since startup, CCAT has experienced only one minor
problem—a blown fuse on the DC input to the inverter.
They suspect that this was due to enhanced insolation
conditions associated with cloud reflection.
The team are very pleased with the performance of their new
PV system and our decision to reconnect to the grid. They
do realize that their reconnection to the grid threatens to
make them less aware of their energy use patterns and lax
in their energy efficiency efforts. So they are making a
concerted effort to keep track of their usage and to
maintain their efficient ways.
