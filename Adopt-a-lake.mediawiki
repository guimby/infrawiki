The Lake County Adopt-a-Lake Program is a volunteer program that helps to preserve and enhance the Countyâ€™s lakes. It is similar in some aspects to an adopt-a-road program.

The Adopt-a-Lake Program encourages local civic organizations, individuals and fraternal and business groups to adopt a segment of a lake's shoreline. Unlike an adopt-a-road program where litter cleanup is the sole component, the Lake County Adopt-a-Lake Program is comprised of three separate components: Water-Quality Monitoring, Education and Pollution Prevention.

All an organization needs to get started is volunteers who are in good physical shape responsible and interested in helping to keep Lake County's communities clean and beautiful. Procedures and safety policies are in place to protect volunteers. There are many other benefits to participating in the Lake County Adopt-a-Lake Program.
