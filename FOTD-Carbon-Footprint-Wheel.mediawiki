== Abstract ==
The Carbon Footprint Wheel was designed for [[Friends of the Dunes]] and is to be located at the [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ Humboldt Coastal Nature Center]. Team Duneheads was posed with the task of designing an interpretive display to enhance the educational and aesthetic value of the Living Learning trail. The Carbon Footprint Wheel became the solution chosen for the Living Learning Trail after research, alternative solutions to the problem were developed, and a process of deciding a final solution was completed. This page also includes a table of material and time costs devoted to the design of the Carbon Footprint Wheel, as well as a table of criteria and specifications upon which the final decision making process was based.

== Background ==
The Carbon Footprint Wheel was designed during the Spring 2012 [[Engr215 Introduction to Design]] class at [http://www.humboldt.edu/ Humboldt State University]. The project was intended to be a 12 week design project for Friends of the Dunes (FOTD). Team Duneheads was designated the task of designing an interpretive node for the Living Learning trail at the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center. Through meetings the the director of [[Friends of the Dunes]], Carol Vander Meer, criteria and specifications for the design of the interpretive display were developed. After extensive research into topics related to project was complete, several topics of emphasis were decided upon. Based on these topics, the Duneheads developed several alternative solutions aimed to satisfy the criteria and specifications of the project. Using several methods, the final decision was completed and the Carbon Footprint Wheel was decided to be the most suitable solution for Friends of the Dunes. FOTD's desire for an educational tool related to the environmental impact of transportation modes used to travel to the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center was the inspiration for the development of the Carbon Footprint Wheel. The wheel also strives to pique their interest in the other information provided by the Living Learning Trail.

===Components===

====Driftwood====

The driftwood used in the project was found on Clam Beach. The curvature and even bend made it a perfect selection for our support post.

====Wheel====
The graphic design disc showing [http://www.appropedia.org/Carbon_footprint  Carbon footprint] was mounted on a 22 inch bicycle wheel. Spokes were removed from one side of the hub to make the outer rim and disc flush. The design was created using a combination of Adobe Image ready and Photoshop. The Duneheads designed the wheel to compliment the natural aesthetic of the dunes. Colors were chosen to correspond with the various carbon footprints and with the site's surroundings. The friends of the dunes logo's are printed on the front cover.
