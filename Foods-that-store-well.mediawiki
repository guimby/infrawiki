Foods that store well are useful for [[temporary settlements]] (whether [[camping]] trips or [[refugee camps]]) and in preparation for [[disasters]] (especially if you live in an area prone to natural disasters such as [[flood]] or [[earthquake]]).

* [[Vegetables that store well]] - [[root vegetables]] and [[winter squashes]] are key.
* [[Dried pulses]] (various [[beans]], [[lentils]], [[chick peas]]) - the biggest danger is that they are eaten by [[insect pests]] whose eggs are already in there. How can this be reduced? (Keep cool and extremely dry?)
* [[Sprouts]] (depending on climate) - the sprouts don't store well, but the ingredients and equipment (i.e. [[seeds]], water, a jar and mesh) can store at least for months - even years if the seeds are stored well.
* Depending on facilities, [[grains]] or bread may be useful. [[Oats]] for example can be easily used to make nutritious [[porridge]], though most grains are less useful.
