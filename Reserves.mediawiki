'''Reserves''' are the amount of a resource that is recoverable at current prices and with current technology. We never really know how may reserves we have due to the changing of our knowledge and technology itself. For example when and if technology because better advanced for us to get [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] easier, then the amount reserves will raise. So the smarter that we get in these ares the more resources we could possibly have one day! [[Haney]] October 5 3:21
