=SEARC Spectral Project==

==Objectives:==

The objective of this project is to measure the full light spectrum (visible & infrared) at seven different angles, including direct and diffuse radiation.  This is to simulate the sun striking the [[photovoltaic]] panels at seven different angles. This data will be used to better understand the spectral effects on PV, but also to optimize system and device design for a specific geographic location.

==Background:==

This project was started by the [[Queens Applied Sustainability Group]] over the summer of 2011.  On Wednesday April 11/12 Roger Gauthier & Quinn Bentley from SEARC assumed control of managing the equipment from Rob Andrews. [[SEARC]], [[QAS]], [[MOST]] and UBP are all collaborating on this project.


==Equipment==
'''Software'''

Avasoft Ver. 7.5.3
Arduino Uno Ver. 1.0

'''Hardware'''

– Avantes NIR (near infrared fibre optic) Spectrometer

AVS-Rackmount-USB2:  19” Rackmount for USB2 platform multichannel AvaSpec, incl. channel synchronization, USB2-hub and 100 – 240 VAC power supply, supports max. 10 rackmount unit spectrometer channels.

User: Avantes Inc.Date: 04-05-11
Channel(s): 2 Software: Full, Irr

'''Features:'''

AvaSpec – USB2.0 platform – offers maximum modularity
The AvaSpec – USB2.0 platform offers maximum modularity for multi-channel applications.  For each channel a different wavelength range, detector and integration time can be selected, without losing the advantage of synchronization between the different channels.  The AvaSpec – USB2.0 platform uses the USB2.0 bus to connect the different channels to the PC platform and supports up to 127 channels.  Applications that can be realized with the AvaSpec – USB2.0 multi – channel platform:

- Different integration times or averaging settings per channel, still start each scan simultaneously for all synchronized channels
- Different detector types, such as UV/VIS and NIR detectors possible to cover a wide wavelength range with one spectrometer system
- More than 8 channels (even up to 127 channels) can be connected through USB2 hubs.
