==Air Quality Egg==
A project aiming to give citizens a way to participate in the conversation about [[air quality]]. It is composed of a sensing device that measures the air quality in the immediate environment and an on-line community that is sharing this information in real-time.

It is a community-developed, [[open source]] project that is driven by people who care about the air they breathe.
