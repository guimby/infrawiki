'''Potash''' is formed from ashes.

Potash is usually sourced from a garden centre or hardware store. It is used most for gardening purposes, mainly as a fertiliser. It can be used for other purposes, such as being turned into a cleaning product.

== Making your own potash ==

Potash can be made using household ashes. Place completely cooled down fireplace ashes into a plastic bag that can be completely sealed. Seal the bag. Crush and press the ashes in the bag until they take on a powdered form.
