=== Near-term Plans ===
Drawing on these demonstrations and team interactions, the project will develop:

#Guiding principles and strategies for infrastructures for refugee and other stressed populations (to be compared with existing guidance from established agencies),
#An integrated and continuously improving set of best practices for such communities,
#Targeted training resources in various formats,
#A sustainable, collaborating community of practice,
#Best practices for moving information about field performance rapidly back to design teams and forward again as improved solutions.

Having completed the first pat of Phase I, the next steps in TIDES are to:

#Solidify the core teams and encourage more volunteers for follow-on activities.
#Revise the TIDES project charter.
#Identify education and training opportunities and enlist partners.
#Develop draft multi-format documentation of potential solution sets and operating procedures (a wiki is available to support collaborative editing and lessons learned at: [[STAR-TIDES Field Manual]]
#Develop test plans for future work.
#Document the group's efforts to facilitate training, extend the user base, and help other groups learn to operate in open source-style collaborative networks with diverse participants from a mixed team of institutions, individuals, companies and projects.
#Develop the policies, procedures, and logistic support chains to apply TIDES-like solutions to real world needs. Materials to help other groups learn
