== About ==
This is a wikipage for notes on the [http://rebootbritain.com Reboot Britain] conference.

It's hosted on [http://appropedia.org Appropedia] which is a group focussed on using the internet to spread appropriate technology solutions to global problems like hunger, water and sanitation, and public health.

== Reboot Reboot Britain ==
Let's actually do a short unconference here and actually get some communication about the real issues.

=== Issues ===

* '''[[Poverty]] and the Internet''' - 10 years form now there will be 2 billion people with broadband internet access but no toilet. This is a huge volatile oncoming issue (cf. Iran) with deep of foreign policy implications. Who's minding the store on this? What can we do to help?

* '''Rights, Privacy and Identity Management''' - should we follow the Estonian model and have the government provide authenticated digital identities? What about the global push to censorship of the internet?
