==THE PEDAL POWERED DRILL PRESS==

<gallery>
Image:Drill1.jpg|Bart Orlando demonstrates how exercise can be converted into constructive work using a pedal-powered drillpress which he designed and built at CCAT with the assistance of HSU engineering student - Aidan Semingson.
Image:Drill2.jpg|The flywheel of the exercise bike has been modified by adding on a large sprocket which drives a bike chain when the bike is pedaled.
Image:Drill3.jpg|The chain is wrapped around a shaft-mounted free wheel sprocket. The horizontal shaft is supported on the right side by a pillow block. It is connected on the left side to a right angle drive which in turn spins a vertical shaft which is substituted for the drive shaft of the original electric motor.
Image:Drill4.jpg|The pedal powered drillpress was displayed in the pedal power lab located in the CCAT basement workshop. It is now displayed in the garage of CCAT's temporary office building.
