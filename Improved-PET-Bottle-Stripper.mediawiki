==Abstract==

In many countries, disposing of PET bottles has caused a major problem. Recycling these bottles proves a difficult challenge. This Bottle Stripper turns PET bottles into long strips that can be used to weave baskets, use as fishing line, use as a type of rope, or possibly even as 3D printer filament. This design spools the strips automatically as it operates.

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==

* Athena Delta RepRap or equivalent 3D printer
* PLA or ABS plastic filament
* .STL Slicer program (Cura/Slic3r/etc.)
* Appropriate driver for chosen bolts

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==

* Proficient knowledge in 3D printer operation
* Basic mechanical assembly skills

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

# Download files listed above
# Print specified number of parts
# Clean parts as needed with a razor blade
# Assemble parts as shown in the Completed Assembly photo above.
## Use 10mm bolts to clamp razor blade and spool rod
## Use 16mm bolts to secure parts to base (add washers as needed if bolts stick too far past bottom of the base)


=== Common Problems and Solutions===
 
* Cutting slots may need trimming before use

* Bottles tend to begin to cut into plastic stripper over time. May need to replace with metal substitute.

== Cost savings==

* ~252grams plastic filament - ~$7.32USD @ $29USD/kg
* $1.89 in hardware from McMaster.com
* 50 pack of utility blades $9.58 on Amazon
* Total cost ~$18.79 
* No commercial equivalent can be found (other self made solutions, but no detailed drawings found)
* Savings is in time from self-spooling action
