===The Bicycle Learning Center===
*'''Description:''' The Bicycle Learning Center is a place for people to learn how to fix their bikes, enabling them to practice [[self sufficient]]  transportation.  The BLC is staffed by volunteers and is donation based, making it self sufficient as well.  
*'''Justification:''' The BLC is a place for people to learn how to be independent, whether they use their bike for transportation or recreation, when you can fix it your self you are in control.
*'''Issues:''' The BLC is run by volunteers so it only works as well as we do.
*'''Location:''' The BLC is nestled in the crook of Nelson Hall on the HSU campus, right across from the Depot.
*'''Notes:''' You can e-mail the BLC at hsublc@humboldt.edu for more info, or if you are interested in volunteering.
