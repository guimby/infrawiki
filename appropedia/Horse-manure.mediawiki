'''[[Horse]] [[manure]]''' is perhaps the most easily available manure type in the [[UK]]. Generally It is mixed up with [[hay]], [[wood chippings]] or [[sawdust]], as sweepings from [[stable]] floors. Its is generally dried out so easier to handle. It tends to contain [[seeds]], that often go undigested, which may cause [[weeds]] in [[gardening]]. An average adult riding horse (weighing approximately 900 - 1100 pounds) produces around 8 to 9 tons (16,000 and 18,000 pounds) of manure every year.
