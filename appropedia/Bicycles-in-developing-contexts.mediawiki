This article details the installation of panniers and luggage carriers unto regular [[bicycle]]s, ie to allow use of the bicycle as a '''freight bicycle'''.<ref name="KVDP, november 2012" />

== Pannier installation ==

The carrying capacity of the bicycle can be greatly increased by attaching panniers either
side of the wheel. However, the loads in the panniers must be reasonably well balanced.
Panniers are particularly suited to carrying containers such as used for carrying water.

Panniers may simply be sacks or woven baskets hung from lengths of wood or bamboo fixed
across the carrier or may be frames manufactured from wood or steel. They need to be as
light as possible.

The design shown is a steel frame, which may be either welded or pinned together so that it
can be folded up when it is not in use.

The base and sides may be filled in with wire mesh (weldmesh), wooden slats or canvas
type material. The ends can be filled in on fixed panniers but not on fold-up designs.

===Luggage carrier installation===
These low cost adaptations of standard bicycles enable larger and more bulky loads to be
carried on an extended rear carrier.

The load that can be carried is limited by the strength of the rear wheel and tyre. A
strengthened wheel can be used so that the limiting factor is the load capacity of the tyre.

This particular bicycle adaptation requires; the chain to be lengthened, the brackets for the
rear break to be moved, and the brake rods to be lengthened. The frame does not have to
be cut or modified in any way.

===Construction of a luggage carrier with small (20”) rear wheel===
The advantages of a small rear wheel are; there is more space for the load, the load is lower
and easier to balance, the wheel is stronger, and the bicycle is easier to pedal. The main
disadvantage is that the smaller wheel does not ride as easily over pumps and potholes.
