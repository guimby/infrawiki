= Abstract =

'''''Diabetes''''' is considered a '''syndrome''' rather than a disease by modern medicine. It remains a companion to the grave - once diabetic always diabetic is the order of the day. Due to different reasons the '''''Beta cells''''' of '''''Pancreas''''' get impaired and adversely affects the quality or quantity or both of '''''Insulin''''' being produced in the body - partially in case of Type 2 & totally in case of Type 1 Diabetes. Due to the insufficiency or inefficiency of insulin produced by pancreas, blood sugar levels go up degrading strength & health of human body by starving all cells. Damaging vulnerable organs like Kidney & Heart makes diabetes fatal; whereas impairment of Retina of eye, cerebral haemorrhage/stroke, gangrene of foot/lower-leg etc make rest of life miserable.

Diabetes is seen to be progressive, degenerative & incurable. This is because the cause (impairment of pancreas) is never treated; only its effect (blood sugar increase) is looked into and taken care of.

The author hence left the beaten track when he was diagnosed diabetic & took a drastically different approach instead, based on the enlightenment imparted by an Aayurveeda exponent and his own exposure. He designed a diet based on '''''Long Wheat Mash''''' as the staple part & a life style appropriate to a diabetic. Within weeks of the special regimen, '''''FBS''''' & '''''PPBS''''' came down steadily & settled at normal values. But it took still longer for the '''''HbA1c''''' to descend to normal range. Then he confirmed cure by '''''OGTT''''', and reconfirmed it with a repeat OGTT at another '''NABL''', '''ISO''' & '''ACHSI''' certified lab. He further assured the cure by a '''''serum insulin''''' test also.

In order to ensure that the illness or '''syndrome''' has not returned by switching back to normal diet, he gets FBS & PPBS tested every month and HbA1c quarterly from 2009 onwards.

Key words: Diabetes mellitus, FBS, PPBS, HbA1c, GTT, Serum insulin, Pancreas, Beta cells, Long wheat, Mash.

[[Image:LW.EfficacyInDiabControl.jpg|thumb|Click to enlarge picture]]

Scientific evidence corroborating [[User:Georgedappilly|Georgedappilly]]'s claim (2009) on hypoglycemic efficacy of[[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Name_in_different_languages|Long Wheat]] had been lying dormant for one and a half decades in a [http://diabetes.org.in/journal/2001_july-sept/original_article5.pdf Scientific Paper] [2]. Unfortunately the conclusion of the paper was in the negative on hypoglycemic effect of LW. This turned out to be a '''blessing in disguise''' for [[User:Georgedappilly|Georgedappilly]]. '''A staunch opponent of Long Wheat Mash Diet Regimen [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Long_Wheat_Mash_Diet_Regimen_.28LWMDR.29|LWMDR]] dug out the 14 year old study paper. I followed the link & at the very first glance itself noticed the positive fact contained in the included data [http://diabetes.org.in/journal/2001_july-sept/original_article5.pdf (TAble II of the paper)] [2]. This is a '''panacea''' for Diabetics but a '''dust in the eye''' for some others!

[[Image:LW.EfficacyInDiab.jpg|Centre|thumb|Click to enlarge picture]]

The point that authors left unnoticed in the paper & caught my attention as '''very important''' is:
'''the increase in blood sugar that happened due to the experimental diet in ''two'' fortnights was reverted by the next ''one'' fortnight in the case of Group I (who used Dicoccum whole Wheat flour) but not so in the case of  Group II (who used Bread Wheat flour)!!!'''

This study also indicates that even LW flour in the form of '''''unleavened bread''''' works (not only mash!) in regulating the Blood Sugar of Diabetes patients.

The referred ''paper'' is certainly a great encouragement to all those who are on [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Long_Wheat_Mash_Diet_Regimen_.28LWMDR.29|LWMDR]] as well as those who are contemplating on trying [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Long_Wheat_Mash_Diet_Regimen_.28LWMDR.29|LWMDR]].

= Usual life-cycle of the dreaded disease named Diabetes as understood by [[User:Georgedappilly|me]] =

Most persons think & propagate that Diabetes is a syndrome and not a disease; hence incurable. I totally disagree with both. Diabetes is also considered to be caused by the impairment of Pancreas (to be more precise, of Beta-cells which produce the hormone Insulin). From the time of reading about Insulin resistance (IR) I beg to differ with the Pancreas-BetaCell theory also.

== Insulin Resistance, one of the triggers and sustainers of Diabetes ==

Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of gland Pancreas. Initially it is attached to C-peptide as "Siamese twins" and gets detached on maturing in blood. Half life period of endogenous Insulin is estimated to be 5 minutes (whereas that of C-peptide is 30 min). It is Insulin that helps Glucose molecules enter cells from Blood easily and normslise the Blood Glucose level.


When the quantum of Glucose is more than what is needed to meet the immediate energy requirements, the excess quantity is stored as Glycogen in Liver and further as fat at other parts of the body.


When the storage spaces overflow, cells find it difficult to receive Glucose at the prevailing rate and signal the Insulin receptors to reduce their sensitivity. This is known as '''Insulin resistance (IR)'''.


IR in turn reduces Glucose (G) absorption/removal from Blood (B). In my opinion this phenomenon is Diabetes. This leads to increased BG levels and a host of subsequent problems generally known as Diabetic complications.


Misinterpreting the increased levels of BG (alias Blood Sugar - BS) being caused by shortage of Insulin, body intelligence signals Pancreas to enhance production. This may give a temporary relief but leads to higher levels of Insulin & Glucose in Blood as the IR still prevails.

Increased BS levels lead to further increase in IR! Aaaaand the vicious circle continue obviously till ... ...


Misunderstanding the increased levels of BG/BS being caused by shortage of Insulin, patients are advised and resorts to:

A. physical exercises,

B. oral therapies to whip Pancreas for producing more Insulin,

C. inject extraneous Insulin,

etcetera in order to force cells to absorb more Glucose from Blood.

Being unaware of IR and due to taste and enjoyment considerations, patients continue to take sweet/starch in improper quantities. This in turn cause further hardships to cells. This leads to further increase of IR to face the enhanced challenge. This further worsens the situation and pushes the BS level to still higher values! Subsequently we enhance the therapy level. This vicious circle continues till the "unstable phase" alias "Brittle Diabetes" emerge!!

== Four cases compared to show role of IR in trigger & sustenance of DM ==

=== Analysis ===

== Effect of Diabetes on subsystems &/or components of human body ==

'''PRIMARY: (usually go unnoticed)'''
# Blood sugar level exceeding upper limits (FBS >100 mg/dl, PPBS>140 mg/dl)
# HbA1C increasing (normal range: 4.2% - 5.7%)
# Cells being deprived of Oxygen & Glucose

'''SECONDARY: (obvious & leads to detection)'''
# Frequent urination, persisting &/or unclenched thirst & repeating hunger.
# Quick & unexplainable weight loss.
# Persistent tire & fatigue unresolved even by food intakes and rest.
# Possible misunderstanding among young couples sometimes leading to family breakdown due to '''diabetic sexual dysfunction'''

'''TERTIARY: (affecting quality of life & confidence)'''
# Numbness in lower parts of legs (ankles & feet). [[Image:Degenerating_leg_of_a_prolonged_diabetic.JPG|right|thumb|CLICK TO ENLARGE PICTURE <font color=#EE0000>Leg of a prolonged Diabetes patient</font>]]
# Even minor skin injuries developing to prolonged wounds.
# Loss of sensation. (Even ant-bites on wounds being not sensed.)
#  Liver enlargement & associated/subsequent problems

'''FIERCE FINALE: Diabetic neuropathy sometimes culminating in:-'''
# Diabetic neuropathy gangrene of legs – leading to amputations.
# Diabetic retinopathy – irreversible loss of sight.
# Diabetic nephropathy – irreparable kidney damage.
# Diabetic brain hemorrhage (Stroke )– lifelong total or partial paralysis.
# Atherosclerotic Heart Disease (Silent Angina) – the FINAL event.

== '''The beaten track of Diabetes management''' ==

<font color="green">'''Stage 1:'''</font> Starts with exercise & diet control (quantity restriction & Glycemic Index based food swapping).

<font color="blue">'''Stage 2:'''</font> Progress to low dose medication usually ½ Tab once daily in addition to stage 1 practices.

<font color="blue">'''Stage 3:'''</font> Advance to higher doses of Tabs + Stage 1 practices.

<font color="blue">'''Stage 4:'''</font> Switch to stronger Tabs in Stage 3 practices.

<font color="orange">'''Stage 5:'''</font> Progress further to INSULIN injection (initially once daily, then twice, thrice & finally with every meal) in addition to Stage 1 practices.

<font color="orange">'''Stage 6:'''</font> Then combination of a few of the above.

<font color="red">'''Stage 7:'''</font> Combination (union) of all the above (diet control, exercise, tabs & insulin injections).

<font color="red">'''Stage 8:'''</font> '''Finally the UNSTABLE phase''' where prescribed dose of medicines pulls to hypoglycemia & reduced dose shoots the blood sugar up! (this topples the peace of mind as well as courage). This phase is known as Brittle Diabetes among medical professionals.

=== A MalayalaM news paper report ===

Met two Diabetic patients suffering severe pain due to gangrened foot, on a railway platform. This sight forced me to a news paper office near by. I explained the encounter & my different experience with LWMDR.

The reporter is nice & was patient enough to listen to me for 2 hours!

They published reports at their printed & online editions. [http://www.rashtradeepika.com/shugar/ A Malayalam news paper report].

= A very brief description of George's experience =

A blood test on Jul 07, 2006 showed FBS 118 mg/dl &amp; PPBS 197 mg/dl. Doctor declared him ''diabetic'' and prescribed Amaryl 1.0 mg 1/2-0-0. With doctor's permission he went on diet management without taking medicine. Regular periodic check ups showed positive changes. 

On Jan 24, 2009 switched from FBS-PPBS monitoring to FBS, PPBS & HbA1C (HPLC in D10 Biorad)monitoring. That day HbA1C showed 6.3% (reference range: 4.5%-6.3%). Next on Apr 22, 2009 it came down to 6.1% and on Jul 25, 2009 to 5.9%!!! 

Then he decided to go for a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test#Procedure_for_OGTT '''GTT'''] and had it on Sep 10, 2009. From FBS 85 mg%, with an oral glucose load of 75 gms it went to 155 at 1/2 hr, to 160 at 1 hr, came down to 135 at 1.5 hrs, to 100 at 2 hrs and to 90 at 2.5 hrs!!! 

According to endocrineweb (http://www.endocrineweb.com/diabetes/diagnosis.html) and [[Wikipedia]] ''these results show that his diabetes is '''cured'''''. 

 In order to make things doubly sure, he took a second GTT at another
 lab (of an [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4ADBR_enIN317IN321&q=NABH '''N A B H'''], [http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html '''I S O'''] & [http://www.achs.org.au/ACHSI '''A C H S I'''] accredited hospital).
 That corroborated the previous test result.

= Long Wheat Mash Diet Regimen (LWMDR) =

A name (GEM diet) was coined during March 2013 by a gentleman who is diabetic for more than two decades - 1991 onwards. He was administering 99 units of insulin & 1700 mg Metformin tab daily. He is very happy with the relief achieved by following my special diet. The word he chose to denote his experience, by following the diet detailed below, right from week one is '''''amazing'''''. It was then that he coined that name. The improvement continue(s/d) through the 11th week (June first week of 2013) also seamlessly.

But a Google search revealed that there is another diet existing with the same name, for weight reduction. Hence the need of an unique name being imperative, this new name - Long Wheat Mash Diet Regimen (LWMDR) - is chosen to avoid duplication/confusion. 

== Modus operandi ==

*In order to obtain initial conditions, get FBS, PPBS, HbA1C, Serum Insulin & C-peptide tests done before hand.

<br>

#Facilitate required (optimum-NOT maximum) rest to pancreas by '''TOTALLY AVOIDING sweet intake; avoid fruits as well''' till getting CURED. Avoid Maida flour, softened with Alloxan as it destroys Beta cells of Pancreas.
#Substitute break fast and dinner by long-wheat kanji (porridge/mash) with a pinch of salt as required and curries (hot/sour side dishes - with no sweet, no starchy vegetables). '''Continue lunch as it is''' (with  '''restrictions on''' oil, fat, starchy vegetables like potato, tapioca etc & sweet). '''Take all the three meals stomach full.''' As body extracts micro medicine from LWM, intake is to be equispaced & voluminous; hence LWM swapped with staple part of breakfast & dinner.
#Reduce food intake frequency by postponing &amp;/or combining and filling the gaps with plain water, buttermilk, fresh lime juice without sugar, vegetable salads etc. '''Most of the root-vegetables are rich in starch.''' May eat or drink more if number of intakes is three (3) or less including refreshments (snacks, tea, coffee, cool drinks etc.) in a day. '''Reduce oil & fat intake'''.
#Brisk, medium or at least normal walk preferably for an hour daily.

=== Caution  ===

#Buy & use only unbroken long-wheat lest you should be cheated.
#If blood sugar does not start decreasing in a month, avoid smoking & liquor if you are in the habit of having them. 
#Monitor blood sugar regularly - PPBS weekly, FBS at least monthly &amp; HbA1C quarterly. 
#<u>If already on '''tab. or insulin inj. one must continue those &''' monitor blood sugar more frequently, preferably daily, at least '''for a week'''. Else one may slip into low blood sugar problem </u>(hypoglycaemia?). As the FBS approach (not reach) lower limit (70 mg/dL or 3.89 mmol/L), reduce medication in small quantity either in consultation with your medical adviser or based on your judgement in conultation with [[User:Georgedappilly|me]]. Continue tapering down medicines till doses reach zero. Continue LWMDR till confirming cure by FBS, PPBS, HbA1c, OGTT, Serum Insulin & C-peptide tests after being ON NORMAL DIET for a few weeks.
#'''Neglecting any of the above eight points (four of modus operandi and four of caution) is similar to removing one of the legs of a table.'''

==== '''As you approach CURE, progress will be slower.''' ====

* In the case of '''advanced & prolonged diabetics''' having large medication, '''improvement''' (blood sugar reduction) will be visible on a '''daily basis'''.
* In '''moderate cases''' progress will be shown on a '''weekly or monthly basis''' only.
* '''Initial cases or those who have returned to near-normal''' values will see only '''monthly or quarterly''' betterment.
* Once blood sugar is normal, the '''cure process''' starts. Its progress will be '''still slower''' because the damaged organ '''(pancreas) is to get repaired'''.
* First improvement will be in PPBS, then comes FBS & subsequently HbA1c.

==== Why use only whole-grain Long Wheat? ====

# Broken or floured LW can be undetectably adulterated. It will be ineffective, in curing Diabetes,  proportionate to the extent of adulteration.
# Adulteration is usually done using cheaper alternates for financial gain of manufacturer/trader & loss to buyer/consumer.
# Over & above these, broken/floured & pachaged LW is almost twice as costly as wholegrain, in many places.
# '''Most important:''' Static charge accumulation by dry grinding may damage the curative ability of LW. If the static charge from the hand of a tradesman or engineer can damage man-made VLSIs & computer chips, the possibility of LW getting damaged can not be ruled out. 

 Most of the statements in this whole article (not this section alone) are my personal experiences, observations & inferences.
 Those are subjected only to my logical thinking and not to the so called '''''rigorous scientific study or analysis'''''.

== Some remarks ==

#Diabetes (Type II) is considered to be mainly inherited from members up the family tree. Obesity, side effect of some medicines, sedentary life style, physiological or psychological shocks and some '''unknown reasons''' are also regarded as its causes.
#The victims as well as phisicians feel, belive & tell it can only be (supposedly) watched, monitored & controlled carefully,
#and have to teach & learn to live with it for ever.
#But this [[User:Georgedappilly|User's]] experience indicate that diabetes is '''more caused than happening'''.
#and can be prevented/cured and need not live with it for ever.
#The opinion that '''any amount of sweet or starch intake is OK until one become diabetic''' is NOT right.
#Pancreas is '''not meant to work 24X7 like the heart & lungs'''. It needs rest! Frequent food intakes strains it, instead.
#
 '''However meticulous be the ''maintenance'' and good be the ''control'' of one's Diabetes, its degenerative feature DO persist'''
 '''and damage vital organs (like Kidney, Eyes, Heart, ...) in due course.'''
 
 That is why a diabetic patient passes away every 10 seconds (http://www.qda.org.qa/output/page4.asp).
 It is NOT SO after cure.

== Duration required for diabetes cure ==

Presently (Nov 2009) data available is with regard to '''a single case''' of the [[User:Georgedappilly]]. It took three (3) years (from July 2006 to July 2009) to get his diabetes cured completly. His being the maiden case, many ''pit-falls'' occurred in the process. In future, the duration can be brought down because many mistakes are known now and these can be avoided in coming cases.

=== The pit-falls ===

==== Mistaking normal FBS & PPBS values for CURE ====


[[Image:Blood_Sugar_History.jpg|right|thumb|CLICK TO ENLARGE PIC Blood sugar (<font color="blue">FBS blue</font> & <font color=#EE0000>PPBS red</font>) history from pre diabetic to post diabetic phase]]
*''Blood sugar history from pre-diabetic to post-diabetic phase'' (<font color="blue">FBS blue</font> & <font color=#EE0000>PPBS red</font>)


#On completion of eight(8) weeks of special regimen, as the PPBS and FBS came below 140mg% and 105mg% respectively, he marginally relaxed the food restrictions. This moved PPBS above 140mg% in just twelve (12) days (!) {where as it took more than forty (40) days for the FBS to cross the 105mg% mark}.
#PPBS fell even below FBS level (105mg%) by Jan 2007 (by reintroducing diet control) and remained there till Feb 2007. This was '''''misunderstood as CURE''''' and again relaxed the intake constraints. By a lapse of four (4) months, even though FBS remained much below 105mg% ( at June beginning) '''PPBS shot up above 140 mg%'''.
#On reimposing the restrictions, once again PPBS dropped down even below 105mg% (FBS level) and continued there for three months (12 weeks!). This again was ''''' wrongly interpreted as a cure''''' and led to giving up of restrictions. This pushed up the PPBS to 192mg% by July 2008 (even though FBS continued near 105mg%).
#From mid August to end December 2008, PPBS remained below 140mg% (PPBS upper limit) & FBS continued near or below 105mg% (FBS upper limit). For a fourth time he was misled by these low FBS-PPBS values. As it should have happened, he relaxed diet control and ended up in PPBS reaching 161mg%.
*Reintroducing of diet control this time (Jan 20, 2009 onwards) ''really did the job''. After five (5) months he got an opportunity to subject his ''pancreas to a qualification test''.

==== My experience with FRUITS, during diabetes ====

[[File:HandDrawnBloodSugarHistory_-_ManyPointers.jpg|right]]

===== Plantain fruit =====

#On Jul 07, 2006 my FBS & PPBS were 118 & 197 respectively. My cardiologist prescribed Amaryl. With his permission I started a [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured#Modus_operandi|new regimen of modified diet]] (which later on others christened as GEM Diet). In three weeks (on Aug 01, 2006) those values moved to 120 & 155. In another month (on Sep 01, 2006) those came down to '''100 & 135'''; both in range or '''NORMAL'''.
# Mistaking this as cure re-introduced sugar to morning & evening coffee and restarted taking one plantain fruit after dinner. In eleven days (on Sep 12, 2006) PPBS rose to '''155'''.
# As two sweet items (sugar & fruit) were introduced simultaneously, pinpointing the culprit was impossible. Plantain fruit being natural unprocessed sweet & presuming that sugar is the culprit, withdrew sugar & continued the fruit intake. In another three weeks (on Oct 04, 2006) FBS & PPBS registered '''102 & 160''' respectively.
# Even though both values are higher than their previous ones, the pictorial representation [[File:HandDrawnBlood Sugar History - Edited.jpg|right|thumb|TO ENLARGE PICTURE CLICK IT]] shows that the gradient (rate of growth) is lesser now. Even though this clearly indicated that both sugar and fruit increases blood sugar, I decided to continue taking plantain & avoid sugar for one more month. This was to provide time for the body to stabilise things and hoping that natural/fruit sweet may be harmless for diabetics as ALL 'EXPERTS' say. Next month's test results PROVED THOSE EXPERTS WRONG!! On Nov 07, 2006 FBS & PPBS were 121 & 166 respectively.
# '''Obviously there was no option other than to discontinue fruit intake also'''. In one month (on Dec 07, 2006) FBS & PPBS were 91 & 115 mg/dl. In another month (on Jan 02, 2007) those dropped to 80 & 98 and in one more month (on Feb 03, 2007) even though FBS marginally fluctuated up (to 83) PPBS decreased to 96 mg/dl.
# As both FBS & PPBS remained '''VERY LOW''' for two months, again reintroduced sugar in coffee & one plantain fruit at dinner. After two months (on May 29, 2007) while FBS maintained low normal value of 85 PPBS marked an increase to 155.
# Again withdrawing sugar & fruit brought back '''PPBS to 100''' on Jul 17, 2007 when '''FBS rose to 105!''' After three months (on Oct 15, 2007) FBS & PPBS were 94 & 104.
*On the strength of three months' LOW NORMAL BLOOD SUGAR values, again decided to introduce sugar & fruit intake.

===== Apple & Orange =====

*'''8.''' It was at this point of time that my wife (who is a voracious reader of women's periodicals in malayalam) showed a health article authored by a modern medicine practitioner. It categorically stated that low sweet fruits like APPLE & ORANGE are very safe & appropriate for even Diabetic patients. Additionally she reminded me the age old proverb '''"an apple a day keeps the doctor away"'''. From next day onwards we ate either orange or apple daily; one each if small and half each if large. As I was under the impression that I am cured, tested only FBS for the next six months. All the FBS results were good. On Apr 29, 2008 when I got both FBS & PPBS tested (to consult my cardiologist) I was taken aback totally. Even though FBS was only 100, PPBS was very high - a shocking 165 mg/dl. Next test after ten weeks (Jul 08, 2008) clearly showed that things are worsening; FBS was 107 & ''PPBS was 192 - almost back to square one!''
'''I said to myself ''hell with the expert's write-up on apple/orange. Those who coined the APPLE proverb would not have had Diabetes'''''. Obviously I reverted to NO SWEET. Next test after six weeks (on Aug 22, 2008) showed FBS 100 & PPBS 135. Test on eight weeks (on Oct 17, 2008) marked a marginal increase in FBS to 109, PPBS dropped to 125 (both to within limits). Next test on Dec 20, 2008 (after 9 weeks) also pegged decrease; FBS to 95 & PPBS to 120.
*'''9.''' Unfortunately a fourth time too I was misled by the low BS values & obviously restarted sugar - sweet intake and ended up in PPBS shooting up, to 161mg%.

*'''10'''. It was at this time that I got HbA1C tested for the first time. The value was 6.3%. Then on things made a quantum change. Progress was in leaps & bounds. Rest is history.

=== Qualification test of PANCREAS ===

On July 8, 2009 associated with his visit to 10 houses between 6pm & 1030pm he consumed nearly a dozen sweet items. Next noon he took a wedding feast lunch. It was sumptuous with four (4) very sweet paayasams (porridge) and three (3) other sweet items in addition to more than a dozen other servings. (That day's breakfast was normal since long wheat mash had already been discontinued long ago, presuming cure.) A blood test after two hours of lunch showed a ''PPBS level of 100mg%''!!

=== Hindsight ===

#Had the diet relaxations been not done, the '''cure''' would have been faster and '''complete cure''' would have occurred much earlier.
#Had the information about '''HbA1C''' test been put to use earlier, misinterpreting low/normal FBS-PPBS values to be the indication of a cure would not have happened.
#But for the misinterpretation of low FBS-PPBS, the diet relaxation would not have been resorted to.

=== Anticipation ===

For patients on tablets or injection (insulin) time required for '''complete cure''' can be longer. This is because their treatment will have two phases:
#Tapering down the medicine dosage to zero.
#Allowing the system to repair the impaired pancreas (beta cells).

== Future requirement ==

In order to arrive at more accurate time estimates, co-operation of more volunteers are required. '''[[User:Georgedappilly|Georgedappilly]] cannot harness his own body for the simple reason that ''he is no more a diabetic'''''.  Cooperation of diabetic persons who are on ''tablets or insulin injection for a fairly long period'' only will help arrive at better time estimates.

== Long wheat ==

Long wheat is the trade name of a variety of wheat available in the Indian market. It is more than twice as costly as the common wheat (in India). A picture of the long wheat is given in the gallery below. It compares well with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmer Emmer wheat] [[Image:usdaemmer1.jpg|thumb|100px|Emmer wheat with spikes (Source Wikipedia) <font color=#EE0000>Click on picture, to enlarge.</font>]] [[Image:usdaemmer2.jpg|thumb|100px|Cultivated emmer wheat (Source Wikipedia). <font color=#EE0000>Click on picture, to enlarge.</font>]].

== Emmer wheat ==

The [[Wikipedia]] says 
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmer Emmer wheat] belongs to Kingdom: Plantae, Order: Poales, Family: Poaceae, Genus: Triticum, Species: T.dicoccum, Binomial Name: Triticum dicoccum schrank, Synonyms: T.dicoccon, T.turgidum subsp.dicoccon

*Emmer is a hulled (husked) tetraploid wheat cultivated in mountainous areas. It is famous for making bread good in taste & texture standards. It has more fiber than common wheat.

= Preparing the food supplement "suuji goothamb kanji" alias '''''long wheat mash''''' =

 Soaking Long-wheat (or any dry grain/seed) in water overnight makes cooking faster and saves precious fuel/energy.
* Measure out required quantity of whole-grain Long Wheat. Clean it by removing dust, husk & other foreign elements like stones etc.

== Recipe (algorithm) one ==
* My wife used to cook it without soaking in water & quantity sufficient for two meals together and retaining the second half in the cooking vessel itself as it will be sterile enough to preserve for nearly 12 hours. We used water equal to six times the volume of grain, to cook. Pressure regulating weight (PRW)is put in place when steam exit is continuous. At the first whistle flame is reduced to minimum/sim. Flame is put off at 45 minutes from putting the PRW in place. PRW is removed, to open the lid, only after sufficient time required for the pressure to come to normal level.
* On curing my Diabetes a word spread around & some interested patients ventured on LWMDR. Soon came complaints about difficulty in chewing & doubts about the quantity to be consumed.
* Chewing issue was solved by whipping/mashing in kitchen machine.
* With regard to quantity, a first cut thumb rule given was to use as much as required to quench the hunger or to fill the stomach.
* Later I took the measured quantity my wife used to cook for me and weighed it. That came around 65 grams. Soon I noticed a connection between this number & my body-weight - it was around 63 kilograms those days. Then I coined an easy to remember formula to specify the quantity of dry grain to cook the staple part of one meal of LWM.
* The quantity of Dry grain Long Wheat to be used to cook the staple part of one meal of LWM for a Diabetic patient is '''one gram (''or more'' if required) per every kilogram of body-weigh of that patient.''' If stomach gets over-filled, '''reduce side dishes but not LWM'''.
* '''Do not drain out residual water after cooking; it also will contain essential nutrients - as in the case of many other decoctions.''' In case of difficulty or taste constraints, try using less water for cooking or drink the residual water later on conveniently; I repeat: never drain out residual water.

</gallery>

== Recipe (algorithm) two ==

* Add double volume of water to the measured & cleaned Long Wheat and keep it covered in a container/vessel for soaking. Four-five hours of soaking is sufficient; keeping over-night is harmless.
* Whip in a mixie or grind in a kitchen machine or on a grinding stone, the soaked grain as a coarse or fine batter.
* Add sufficient (5-6 times the volume of dry grain equivalent of) water & boil preferably in an open vessel till cooked. Stir continuously to avoid uneven cooking.
* Add salt (if permitted, that is if there is no BP or Albumin complaint). It will resemble cooked OATS.
* Consume with permitted side dishes (Veg/Non-veg excluding sweet, starchy & root vegetables).
* This recipe makes cooking much faster, consumption & digestion easier.
* As in the case of other things told here, [[User:Georgedappilly|I have personally]] experienced/verified this process & product.
* Concistancy (thick/loose) of the food can be adjusted by varying the following parameters:
# Duration of soaking in water between one and four hours,
# Duration & speed of whipping/wet-grinding,
# Time of adding water during whipping/wet-grinding & quantity of water added.

== Recipe (algorithm) three ('''time optimised two''') ==

* Add double volume of water to the measured & cleaned Long Wheat and heat it in the cooking vessel for a minute or two.
* Keep it covered in the same container/vessel for 5-10 minutes for soaking. (5 mins is sufficient for batter-bits combination).
* Whip in a mixie or grind in a kitchen machine or on a grinding stone, the soaked grain along with the water as a coarse or fine batter.
* Use sufficient (5-6 times the volume of dry grain equivalent of) water to extract the residual batter sticking on the inner surface of the machine by rinsing & use the same to dilute the batter.
*  Boil in an open vessel till cooked. Stir continuously to avoid uneven cooking.
* In 3-4 minutes on stove, consistency of the stuff changes. Then heating may be lowered to minimum. In another 6-7 minutes once more consistency may change indicating cooking completion. Bubbling in the cooking vessel on flame with slower stirring also indicates cooking completion. 

'''Rest, given below, is same as in recipe two.'''

* Add salt (if permitted, that is if there is no BP or Albumin complaint). It will resemble cooked OATS.
* Consume with permitted side dishes (Veg/Non-veg excluding sweet, starchy & root vegetables).
* This recipe makes cooking still faster than recipe-2, consumption & digestion as in the case of recipe-2.
* As in the case of other things told here, [[User:Georgedappilly|I have personally]] experienced/verified this process & product.
* Concistancy (thick/loose) of the food can be adjusted by varying the following parameters:
# Duration of soaking in hot water between five and ten minutes,
# Duration & speed of whipping/wet-grinding,
# Time of adding water during whipping/wet-grinding & quantity of water added.

== Recipe four - unleavened bread using Long Wheat flour ==


[[Image:LW.EfficacyInDiabControl.jpg|thumb|Click to enlarge picture]]

'''Unleavened bread is nothing but the Indian Chappaatthi. Hence narrating preparation procedure is skipped.''' 

Scientific evidence corroborating [[User:Georgedappilly|Georgedappilly]]'s claim (2009) on hypoglycemic efficacy of[[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Name_in_different_languages|Long Wheat]] had been lying dormant for one and a half decades in a [http://diabetes.org.in/journal/2001_july-sept/original_article5.pdf Scientific Paper] [2]. Please note the positive fact contained in the included data [http://diabetes.org.in/journal/2001_july-sept/original_article5.pdf (TAble II of the paper)] [2].

[[Image:LW.EfficacyInDiab.jpg|Centre|thumb|Click to enlarge picture]]

The point that authors left unnoticed in the paper & caught my attention as '''very important''' is:
'''the increase in blood sugar that happened due to the experimental diet in ''two'' fortnights was reverted by the next ''one'' fortnight in the case of Group I (who used Dicoccum whole Wheat flour) but not so in the case of  Group II (who used Bread Wheat flour)!!!'''

'''This study indicates that even LW flour in the form of '''''unleavened bread''''' works (not only mash!) in regulating the Blood Sugar of Diabetes patients.'''

The referred ''paper'' is certainly a great encouragement to all those who are on [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Long_Wheat_Mash_Diet_Regimen_.28LWMDR.29|LWMDR]] as well as those who are contemplating on trying [[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Long_Wheat_Mash_Diet_Regimen_.28LWMDR.29|LWMDR]].

=My Diabetes has not yet returned=


Last Wednesday (27.01.2010) I had the regular quarterly health check up. Along with Lipid profile etc, blood sugar also was monitored. Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) was 100 mg%, Post Prandial  Blood Sugar (PPBS) showed 105 mg% & Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1C) was 6%.

[[Image:DiabetesLabResult27jan2010.JPG|left|Blood sugar (FBS, PPBS & HbA1C) lab result printout after seven months of cure]]


[[Image:BloodsugarGraphIncluding27jan2010.JPG|centre|Blood sugar graph(FBS & PPBS) including result of 27 jan 2010 (ie after seven months of cure)]]

[[Image:DiabCureHistoryOfEMG.JPG|thumb|180px]]

On the way to the consulting room of my physician, I met a friend & his wife. She is diabetic. Just 2 Idlis & ½ a cup of tea took her PPBS to 195 mg% where as 3 Idlis & a full cup of coffee took my PPBS to 105 mg% only! 

What is happening in my case is entirely different from what many people anticipated &/or told on hearing my declaration of the cure of my diabetes.

In spite of taking rice based food thrice daily, coffee/tea with sugar, bakery sweets after lunch frequently (not daily) & 5-6 plantain fruits most of the days for seven (7) months, my diabetes DIDN’T RETURN.

What most of the visitors of my poster presentation (see albums of  [http://picasaweb.google.com/chandragiriyan/DiabetesCuredPosterPresentationIndianScienceCongress2010# day 1] of 3, [http://picasaweb.google.com/chandragiriyan/DiabetesCuredPosterPresentationIndianScienceCongress2010Day2Of3# day 2] of 3 & [http://picasaweb.google.com/chandragiriyan/DiabetesCuredPosterPresentationIndianScienceCongress2010Day3Of3# day 3] of 3) (at the KERALA GRAMAM (Kerala village) exhibition arranged in connection with the 97th Indian Science Congress (ISC2010) at the Kerala University Campus, Kariavattom, Trivandrum) wanted to know was “WHAT IS THE GUARANTEE (OR ARE YOU SURE) THAT DIABETES WILL NOT RETURN?”

My reply was: “AT THIS POINT OF TIME WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT IN SPITE OF NORMAL DIET MY DIABETES DID NOT RETURN FOR SIX (6) MONTHS & IF YOU ASK ME AFTER ANOTHER MONTH, I WILL SAY THAT MY DIABETES DID NOT RETURN FOR SEVEN (7) MONTHS”. This has come true on Jan 27, 2010. Only after the elapse of one year (5 more months from now), I can make a statement that my diabetes did not return for an year.

In order to make a general statement that diabetes will not return for any specific duration, more time, cases & case studies are required. If the present trend continues, that may not happen in the near future for sure. Whom ever I encounter turns out to be unfortunately a pessimist.

One of my friends (a blogger reffered as Ankil) was more eager to ascertain that my claim of cure of diabetes is WRONG, than positively responding to my offer for trying to explore the possibility of a cure of HIS OWN DECADES OLD DIABETES.

Alas!!!

I am reminded of the anecdote of KERALA CRABS.


== 35 weeks! ==
Today (Tue, March 9, 2010) I took the monthly blood sugar test (GOD-POD method). It shows FBS 80 mg% & PPBS 95mg%.
'''This marks the successful completion of consecutive 8 months of the victory of my Pancreas over Diabetes!'''


Again '''Praise The Lord!!'''


But unfortunately even people with decades old diabetes, having progressive & degenerating experience finds disbelieving these results more comfortable.

== One more month of no return: 39 weeks now! ==

The blood sugar test results of April 10, 2010 confirms that '''my diabetes has not returned even after 39 weeks of normal diet containing starch & sugar'''. FBS is 90 mg% and PPBS is 110 mg%. These values are well within limits. '''My pancreas is still going strong'''.

==  <font color=#EE0000>Second anniversary special blood test over 24 hours</font> ==

On completion of two years of CURE of my diabetes, a different sequence of blood sugar tests were carried out and the results are given below (thanks to my daughters for the glucometer & camera which made the total process very handy). As is customary, tested FBS to begin with. It was 92 mg/dl at 7:26 AM. Next, tested morning-PPBS at 2 hours of breakfast. It was 136 mg/dl. Noon-PPBS at 2 hours of lunch was 135 mg/dl & night-PPBS at 2 hours of supper was 133 mg/dl at 9:44 PM. Next morning it was felt that one more FBS test would give a completeness to the picture. Hence it was done & got 84 mg/dl at 7:39 AM. This special sequence test re-confirmes the fact that [[User:Georgedappilly|my experiences & findings on]] Diabetes CURE was & is really REAL since July 2009. It is indeed very heartening to note that my experience and findings of July 2009 gets corroborated by the study results of  [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/biomedicine/research/groups/profile/roy.taylor Dr. Roy Taylor] of the prestigeous [http://www.google.co.in/#hl=en&q=Roy+Taylor+prof.&oq=Roy+Taylor+prof.&aq=f&aqi=&aql=undefined&gs_sm=s&gs_upl=118291l136873l0l16l16l0l3l3l0l317l3009l0.3.9.1l13&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=ed118465c2480a23&biw=1258&bih=633 Newcastle University, UK].

#No one else has ever accomplished this unique goal of '''curing Diabetes''' in human history till July 2009. It was considered to be humanly impossible. Hence it is felt that any one will be justified in opining that    [http://bible.oremus.org/bible.cgi?ql=139956527 '''this is the Lords doing, It is marvelous in our eyes.'''].
#Having conquored Diabetes which is, according to WHO, claiming six (6) lives every minute I wish to take the message and know how to as many victims in as short a time as possible because  [http://bible.oremus.org/bible.cgi?ql=68968227 "no one after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works ...".]
#From the responses of a few responsible persons it is felt that they mistook these efforts to be an attempt to infringe upon their territory.[http://bible.oremus.org/bible.cgi?ql=123971857  "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill." ]
#I desire to be a taste-maker, like salt, to our society. It vanishes itself into other components, improves their qualities & makes the final product tasty. The book named Bible that has the maximum number of copies printed in human history says:  [http://bible.oremus.org/bible.cgi?ql=124164078  "You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot"].
#------------------------
#It is felt that many people mistake me for a Long Wheat cultivator, farmer, trader or researcher. They think that I am cunningly trying to promote the prospects of Long Wheat by misleading Diabetic patients, pretending to have cured Diabetes which is considered by modern science and medicine people as a syndrome & (hence) incurable. I pity them and feel that it is already explained/'''replied''' in a book written '''twenty centuries ago'''; [http://bible.oremus.org/bible.cgi?ql=248071124|that passage is there].

== Albert Einstein cannot be wrong ... ==

 
* He said "if at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it".


== George Bernard Shaw is right ... ==

* He said: "if you have '''an apple''' and I have '''an apple''' and we '''exchange''' these apples then you and I will still '''each have an apple'''. But if you have '''an idea''' and I have '''an idea''' and we '''exchange''' these ideas, then '''each of us will have two ideas'''."

= Another '''Breaking news of diabetes cure''' on June 24, 2011 =

A leading MalayalaM news paper (Malayala Manorama of Kerala - India) of today (25 June 2011) has reported an epoch making finding on curability of diabetes. It obviously is of great interest to User:Georgedappilly along with all the readers of this page and the billions of diabetics world over! A photograph of the news and its English translation are given below.

[[Image:Breaking news in Malayala Manorama 25Jun2011pp5.jpg]]


== Translation ==

'''Title of the news:''' Diabetes likely to be cured by low calorie food.

'''Body of the news:'''

London: Researchers of Newcastle University claim that the Type-2 diabetes seen in elders can be completely cured by sticking to low calorie food pattern for two months continuously. What this finding rejects is the thinking that diabetes is a life long disease.

The [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/jun/24/low-calorie-diet-hope-cure-diabetes Guardian news paper reported] that the experiment was carried out in 11 diabetic patients. Daily they were given food having only 600 calories in the form of vegetables and juices for two months. Medical team subjected these ones to continuous examinations.

By one week itself the fasting blood sugar (FBS) reading became normal. It was found out that the extent of Fat in Pancreas was lowered and that the Pancreas was producing Insulin as it was before the onset of diabetes.

They were returned to normal diet after two months. It was found in later examinations that 7 patients were completely cured of the disease. This method is not useful for juvenile diabetes. It is the Type-2 of adults that is cured by food regulation.

This type of diabetes is caused when Insulin production is impaired by the malfunctioning of liver and pancreas when the fat from the excess food accumulate in them. [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/biomedicine/research/groups/profile/roy.taylor Prof. Roy Taylor]  of Newcastle University explained that reinstating the insulin production on melting away the fat accumulated in the pancreas, by following low calorie food pattern is the methodology.

Participants reported finding the extremely strict diet difficult, but the results are very positive. 

Note that positive effects from exercise and diet have long been known in type-2 diabetes, but these articles suggest that actually curing the condition was not part of conventional medical thinking. 

Note also that the the study appeared to focus on a particular form of diet. It remains to be studied what the success rates are for other forms of diet (different foods, caloric intake and lengths of time), such as George's diet.

== Responses of [[User:Georgedappilly]] to various English language articles ==

* '''Comment 1:''' I am really excited to read this fantastic article because it validates [http://www.appropedia.org/User:Georgedappilly my] findings. From 2006 to 2009 I was Diabetic, but NOT afterwards. I am on normal diet afterwards. My experiences and blood-sugar test results are available at http://www.appropedia.org/Diabetes_mellitus_cured .One can reach it by a Google search of LONG WHEAT. It appears in the first page of search results itself.
A graphical representation of the results are also provided for ease of understanding. This article seems to be visited by more & more people.
I am very much eager to discuss & share my experiences with fellow people for their benefit.
E.M.George 

* '''Comment 2:''' The claim of complete cure of diabetes <b>in 8 weeks</b>, of the Newcastle University research team appears to be somewhat unrealistic. Based on hands-on-experience of <b>curing</b> <i>own diabetes</i> & trying to cure that of more than 100 others, it is very strongly felt that <b>two months is too short a time to cure diabetes completely.</b> This is explained in detail in the [http://www.appropedia.org/Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#The_pit-falls "Pit-falls"]  section of my [http://www.appropedia.org/Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience Appropedia article]. It is indubitable that <i>2 months is more than sufficient to completely control diabetes</i>, <b>but not to cure.<b> This is told because I have really gone through <b>this phase</b>, as explained in the said section "Pit-falls".
600 calories a day appears to be too low. The diet I followed seems to be much easier, comfortable as well as safer. My diet had much more calories a day.
I keep telling my clients that even though the special regimen is simple, it is like swimming, driving or riding a bicycle. One has to learn it under an expert & unfortunately we don't have many experts.
First of all one has to assess the <b>initial conditions</b> such as FBS (8 to 14 hours after any food), PPBS (AT 2 hours after a meal), HbA1C (Glycosylated haemoglobin) and if possible Fasting Serum Insulin. Additionally details regarding other illness, medication for management of Diabetes, body weight & height (or BMI value) etc also are to be considered. Me as well as many of my clients feel that it is rather a <i>smooth sail</i>.
Even though it took three years for me to cure my diabetes (2006 t0 2009), it would have been cured in much shorter a time, had I not encountered the pit-falls explained in the Appropedia article with the help of a graphical representation of blood sugar values.
The mention in another comment that starvation is a cure for all problems is not true. It is felt that strict 600 calorie-a-day veg. diet <i>need not be a necessary & sufficient condition to cure diabetes.</i>

* '''Comment 3:''' In fact the Newcastle research team & their 7 out of 11 volunteers seem to have fallen into the first pit in which I had fallen in early 2006. Nothing to worry. They will recognize it and come out soon! Aaaaand they will re-invent things.

* '''Comment 4:''' <b>See Things In Totality. Compartmentalization & Over-specialization Do Harm, Mostly!</b> posted by E.M.George on 28 Jun 2011 at 6:00 am

600 calories a day is at least impractical (AchsBuster) if not insane (Sonya)! There is an Indian proverb which means anything in excess is bad. So is starving or eating!!
I <b>was</b> diabetic, but not now. I am on my usual diet since july 2009. The dreaded diabetes has not returned yet. Even if it returns, I am not afraid. I know how to cure it once again.
One need not be on 600 cal a day, or no carb, or no meat diet, or keep running to cure diabetes. One has to know the limits & adhere to it.
There is a food substitute mentioned in the ancient Indian medical literature (Aayurveeda) for curing the <i>illness that expels sugar through urine</i>. A judicious use of that grain ([http://www.appropedia.org/Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George's_experience#Long_wheat Long wheat]) and avoidance of sugar & fruits, moderate control on other food intakes during treatment period is almost sure to cure diabetes.
My BMI was less than 21 when I became diabetic. When I was cured of diabetes also my BMI was same. <b>I have very strong hereditary factors in favor of diabetes. Both my parents were diabetic & continued to be so till death. My father died of hypoglycemia in the year 1958.</b>
Diabetes is a basic illness, similar to a voltage drop in an electronic or electrical circuit. That problem will adversely affect all related/connected sub-systems.

This does not mean that diabetes is incurable. GOOD LUCK ALL DIABETICS WORLD OVER.

= Diabetes is CURABLE, but... =

*Diabetes is indubitably curable.
*Cure is not as fast as Prof. Roy Taylor et al of Newcastle University UK claimed in their [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168743/?tool=pubmed paper] [1].
*The paper was presented at the American Diabetes Association conference on June 24, 2011 and published in Diabetologia (2011) 54:2506-2514.
*It has 46 References! (<small>The article is also available online with open access (Distributed under the terms of the relative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited) at Springerlink.com.</small>)

* The fact is that the claim of cure of diabetes made in this [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168743/?tool=pubmed paper] [1] appears to be only partially true.
*It is vividly brought out in the second paragraph of second column of Diabetologia (2011) 54:2511.

That paragraph titled ''Post-intervention observation'' says : "At follow-up 12 weeks after completion of the dietary intervention ... ... HbA<sub>1c</sub> was unchanged (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 6.2 +/- 0.1% [42 +/- 2 vs 44 +/- 1 mmol/mol]; p=0.10) and fasting plasma glucose increased modestly (5.7 +/- 0.5 vs 6.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/l; p<0.01), with a 2 h OGTT plasma glucose of 10.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/l. Three participants had recurrence of diabetes as judged by a 2 h post-load plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/l. ... ..."

Elsewhere in the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168743/?tool=pubmed article] [1] one finds values of "Fasting concentration" of Glucose for different cases and on different days during the course of this research. As these are expressed in "mmol/l" unit, an attempt is made to represent those in "mg/dl" which is more popular among laymen and hence easily comprehensible to common men. They are tabulated below.




{| class="wikitable"

| 102.7 +/- 9.01
| 109.9 +/- 3.6
| 185.0 +/- 18.0

Comparison of these numbers with their specified limits given in the table below and taking note of the escalation of FBS in spite of "advice on portion size and healthy eating", clearly indicate that the '''cure''' is but a temporary phenomena in the case of this research, as explained in the "[[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#The pit-falls| The pit-falls]]" section here. CURE is far far away, "long way to go before one can sleep".

The fact that 3 out of 7 claimed to be "cured" have already been reverted to diabetes in three months (2 h post-load plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/l) makes the result statistically non-significant - though NOT insignificant (only 4 out of 11 = 36.36 %).

This does not mean or imply that diabetes be incurable. It only means that some more time and effort were required. The Newcastle University team did not complete the LAST MILE and hence missed the goal! Probably the ADA conference date persuaded them to prepare and make a declaration prematurely. Look at my results at ([[Diabetes_mellitus_cured_-_George%27s_experience#Lab results from July 2006| Lab results from July 2006.]]).

Results given above show that all the participants of this experiment are at the fag end of the last lap of their race towards recurrence of diabetes by the end of third month of "normal diet" with advice on portion size & healthy eating.

Wikipedia in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test#Interpretation_of_OGTT_results Interpretation of OGTT results] says ''... FPG should be below 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl). Between 6.1 and 7.0 mmol/l (110 and 125 mg/dl) are "impaired fasting glycaemia", and repeatedly at or above 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) are diagnostic of diabetes ...''
It continues: ''The 2 hour OGTT glucose level should be below 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). Levels between this and 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) indicate "impaired glucose tolerance". Glucose levels above 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) at 2 hours confirms a diagnosis of diabetes.''

In the light of this '''WHO criteria''', it becomes evident that no one of the eleven volunteers of the Newcastle study is in the NORMAL or Impaired Fasting Glycaemia levels. Out of the seven (7) claimed to have been cured, four (4) were reverted to Impaired Glucose Tolerance level (FPG < 7.0 mmol/l & 2hr OGTT > 7.8 mmol/l) and the rest three (3) were in the Confirmed Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus level (2hr OGTT > 11.1 mmol/l).

=== In brief === 

To put it in a nutshell, as per the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose_tolerance_test#Interpretation_of_OGTT_results '''1999 WHO Diabetes criteria - Interpretation of OGTT Glucose levels'''] no one of the eleven (11) volunteers of the Newcastle University study appears to be cured.
