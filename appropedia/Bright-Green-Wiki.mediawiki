:''This describes a lapsed project, with valuable lessons learned. For ongoing efforts, see '''[[green wikis]]''' and '''[[Appropedia:About]]'''.''

The '''Bright Green Living Wiki''' was a proposal to start a wiki at www.socialtext.net/brightgreen with a focus on [[bright green]] solutions to the world's challenges.

In September 2004 (19 months before [[Appropedia]] began) Worldchanging.com raised the idea, then following a strong response, initiated the wiki.<ref>[http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001206.html Wiki Guide to Bright Green Living], which was then [http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/001220.html initiated by WorldChanging.com]. Before being set up, "About 50 people have now either left comments offering to help or sent email." September 13, 2004.</ref> The expressions of interest did not follow through, and there was very little activity on the wiki. Though a visionary attempt at the time, it's now clear that [[making a successful wiki is hard]].
