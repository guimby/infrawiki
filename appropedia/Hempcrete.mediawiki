[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hempcrete Hempcrete] is a mixture of hemp hurds (shives) and [[lime]] used as a material for construction and insulation. It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre. Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa (around 1/20 that of residential grade concrete). Hempcrete's density is only 15% that of traditional concrete.
