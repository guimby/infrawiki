Nanowires are going to play a vital role in opto-electronics, especially LED, LASER diodes and Solar Photovoltaics. Nanowires offer significant advantages over planar geometry and growing high quality well oriented nanowires is a key to successfully harness the unlimited potential of these one dimension structures. This page presents some of vital steps and points out several important factors that can/ must be taken into the account while fabricating these nano-structures. 

* growth rate
* substrate temperature
* type of deposition
* mode of deposition - continuous or pulsed
