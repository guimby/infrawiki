== Bring and fix ==

Article in [http://newstartmag.co.uk/features/bring-fix/ NewStart], October 2011

== Repair Café ==

A Repair Cafe is a meeting in which people repair appliances/devices, organized by and for local residents. They meet at a fixed location where tools are available and where they can fix their broken stuff with the help of handy volunteers. Objectives are to reduce the waste pile, to maintain repairing knowledge and to strengthen the social cohesion. {{W|Repair Café}}

== Waste minimization ==

Waste minimization is a process of elimination that involves reducing the amount of waste produced in society and helps eliminate the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, supporting the efforts to promote a more sustainable society. Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and/or changing societal patterns, concerning consumption and production, of waste generation, to prevent the creation of waste. {{W|Waste minimization}}
