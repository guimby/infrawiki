In tackling social and environmental challenges, there are several levels at which action can be taken:
* Individual action - personal steps in [[green living]]
* [[Civil society]] action - NGOs and campaigns
* Agency action in society - government or intergovernmental agencies working through awareness and education, rather than [[regulation]].
* [[Business]] action - whether motivated by principle or image.
* [[Government]] action - [[regulations]], [[subsidies]], [[penalties]] and the creation of [[markets]].

A critical question is: which is most effective? Individual action is concrete and within reach; but government action is wide-reaching and potentially very powerful and effective, by adjusting the [[incentives]] that govern the daily behavior of all citizens.
