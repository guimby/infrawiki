= Beta Radiation =
*In nuclear physics, [[beta decay]] is a type of radioactive decay in which a beta particle (an [[electron]] or a positron) is emitted. In the case of electron emission, it is referred to as "beta minus" (β−), while in the case of a positron emission as "beta plus" (β+).[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_radiation]
*Beta Decay is the most common type of radioactive decay
*Beta radiation can go through your hand but is stopped by a concrete block
*A B- particle is emitted from the nucleus during the decay of a neutron into a proton, and a B+ in the decay of a proton into a neutron. 
*In the alpha and beta decay of radioactive nucleus, "transmutation" of elements occur-an atom of one element becomes an atom of another element, as the number of protons in its nucleus changes. 
*Beta radiation is made up of high energy electrons
