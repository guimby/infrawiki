Radical approaches to '''road signs''' (or '''traffic signs''') are being considered - that fewer signs may make better and safer streets.

rather than clarity through more signs, it can be safer (and create a more pleasant, liveable environment) to have less clarity. By experiencing ambiguity, and having to negotiate with other road uses, people pay better attention and drive more safely.

More signs may make a particular place safer than others. However, attention is a limited resource and more signs overall distract people from watching for actual hazards. 

== Evidence and analysis ==

A possible correlation has been suggested in the accident rates in England (which has very few traffic signs) being much lower than in the [[USA]], which has a much greater use of signs.

[[New Urbanism]] has similar ideas at its heart. New Urbanism is about neighborhood design, and touches on [[traffic]] management as part of this.
