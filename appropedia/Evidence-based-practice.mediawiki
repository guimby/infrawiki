==EBP and Appropriate Technology==

[[Appropriate technology]] and EBP share a common goal of providing solutions that are effective for the individual and the community.

==Criticism of EBP==
Evidence-based practice has been criticized includes the exclusion of under-represented groups from the studies on which the evidence is based. This may be especially true as research is often profit driven by producers of medical technology who seek more affluent populations to market their goods. As well, some feel that the method of passing information from the "expert" to the "base" fosters dependence and discourages individual thinking at the local level <ref>[http://healthwrights.org/books/HHWL/HHWLchapt15.pdf Helping Health Workers Learn: Appropriate and Inappropriate Technology (see page 15-3 "Re-examining some common assumptions" and page 15-8 "Example 3").]</ref>
