'''Actinobacteria''' is a group of bacteria that is found in soil and in freshwater.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria</ref> They are primarily known for their role in soil, where they give soil its earthy smell. If actinobacteria are not present in soil, it will lack the earthy smell.

Actinobacteria are found deep beneath the roots of plants. They have a role in decomposing dead plant and animal material. As they do so, they liberate nutrients such as [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[ammonia]], for use by living plants.

This group of bacteria can produce antibiotics, inhibiting the growth of bacteria and have a role in producing various agricultural and medical products.<ref name="wp" />
