A '''electricity generator''', '''electrical generator''', '''engine-generator''', '''generator-set''' or '''gen-set''' is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy (electricity), generally using electromagnetic induction (by means of a [[alternator]] or [[dynamo]]). The source of the mechanical energy used to generate the electricity may be a [[heat engine|heat]], [[motor|pneumatic]] or [[Motor|electric motor]], [[WECS|a wind turbine]], [[Human power|human]] or [[Animal-powered electricity|animal labour]], [[SECS|the sun]], or [[HECS|the ocean]].

The reverse conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is done by a [[motor]]. A heat engine and alternator/dynamo assembly that is also used to provide heat (for space heating) is called a "[[CHP system|combined heat and power system]]".

[[File:Wood gas generator.png|thumb|right|200px|A wood gas generator with thermal energy recovery (via a [[stirling motor]]) can allow up to 70% of the thermal energy of the burning of wood to be used. A system like this works by using 2 separate electricity generators (1 on the IC-engine, another on the Stirling engine)]]
