'''Arcology''' refers to a set of architectural design principles for enormous habitats (hyperstructures) of extremely high human population density. These  "arcologies," would contain a variety of [[mixed use|residential and commercial facilities]]. They are intended to minimize [[environmental impact]], and to be self-contained or economically [[self-sufficient]].

The word is taken from "ecology" and "architecture," and has been popularized by architect Paolo Soleri.{{w|Paolo Soleri}}
