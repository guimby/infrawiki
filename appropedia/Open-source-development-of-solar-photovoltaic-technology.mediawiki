==Open-source development of solar photovoltaic technology==
[[image:opensourcepv.png|500px|left]]
The rise of solar [[photovoltaic]] (PV) technology as a driver of [[rural electrification]] in the [[developing world]] and a contributor to [[climate change mitigation]] suggests that innovations enhancing PV efficiency and scalability could make considerable strides in reducing both poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. The nearly global access to the solar resource coupled to innovation-driven decreases in the costs of PV provides a path for an renewable energy source to accelerate [[sustainable development]].  Open-source software development has proven to produce reliable and innovative computer code at lower costs than proprietary software through sharing development responsibility with a large community of invested individuals. Concepts of [[open-source design]] have been applied to other fields in an attempt to reap the same benefits realized within software development; however, applying open-source strategies to solar PV research is uncommon. This paper reviews and examines how open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry. The results show how successful open design and development methods can be created and utilized by identifying business models that provide PV researchers, turnkey suppliers and solar PV module manufacturers with the opportunity to utilize open-source design principles to accelerate [[innovation]].
