'''Graphene''' offers enormous promise for [[energy storage]], which is a critical need for making [[renewable energy]] more viable.

[[Graphene]] has two potential applications in energy storage:
* As a supercapacitor,{{w|supercapacitor}} storing energy directly<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/122763-graphene-supercapacitors-are-20-times-as-powerful-can-be-made-with-a-dvd-burner Graphene supercapacitors are 20 times as powerful, can be made with a DVD burner], March 19, 2012, ExtremeTech.</ref>
* Improving the capacity of existing battery technologies.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/05/1210072109.abstract Flexible graphene-based lithium ion batteries with ultrafast charge and discharge rates] (scientific paper), October 8, 2012, PNAS.<br>[http://green.autoblog.com/2012/10/31/calbattery-working-on-300-mile-li-ion-batteries-at-greatly-reduc/ CalBattery working on 300-mile li-ion batteries at greatly reduced cost] (li-ion battery with a silicon-graphene anode, for electric cars), Oct 31st 2012, AutoblogGreen.</ref>

These are relatively recent developments, and time to commercialization is uncertain.

Note 27.05.17: Graphite is electrically conductive, though not as much as graphene. Graphene is harder to make.
