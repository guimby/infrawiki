=='''Introduction'''==
The normal hot end holder just has one fan and the cooling air always blows from one side. One fan design makes the printed part cool down unevenly and there is always one side has more tendency to curve. This design improves the cooling system by redesigning the hot end holder and fixing three fans on it. Three fans are on the u, v, w sides respectively so the cooling air can be blew from three different directions and cool the printed part more consistently.

=='''Design'''==
This hot end holder was designed with Free CAD. 
It is just for Delta so it generally looks like triangular prism. The biggest difference of this design with others is the hot end brace. The hot end brace in this design is not like a semi-circle but consists of three small arcs. These three arcs is not thick so they are flexible and can provide entrance for the hot end. It is necessary to make some supportors for some parts. In this design, the magnet holders, braces and top have 0.6 mm of thickness supportors. It should be noted that the thickness of supportor should be small but larger than nozzle size. For the nozzle size of 0.5 mm, if the thickness of supportor is small than 0.5 mm, the supportor wouldn't show up; if the thickness of supportor equals 0.5 mm, just some of supportors show up, so the thickness of supportors is 0.6 mm in this design.
