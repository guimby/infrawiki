{{topic header| default.png | Food production}} 

'''Food production''' is the production of [[food]]. It incorporates [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]]. Scale and efficiency of food production affect food prices, food choices and [[quality of life]]. The extent to which [[sustainable agriculture]] is practiced affects our [[environment]], our [[climate]], and thus our future. The [[resilience]] of our food production systems affects the extent to which we can withstand a crisis.

==Further distinction==
