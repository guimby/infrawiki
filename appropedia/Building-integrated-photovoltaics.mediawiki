'''Building-integrated photovoltaics''' ('''BIPV''') are [[photovoltaic]] materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the [[building envelope]] such as the [[roof]], [[skylights]], or facades.<ref>http://www.wbdg.org/design/bipv.php</ref> They are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, although existing buildings may be retrofitted with BIPV modules as well.<ref>[http://www.buildingsolar.com/technology.asp buildingsolar.com: Building-Integrated Photovoltaics], Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, accessed: 2007-03-23.</ref> The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace.
