'''Bahía de Caráquez''' is a resort city in [[Ecuador]]. Located in a sandy peninsula on the country's western coast, it has seen significant development during the last 15 to 20 years. 

Bahia de Caraquez became an [[Ecocity]] on February 23, 1999 following the devastation caused by two natural disasters in 1997 and 1998. The city features the world's first [[organic certification|certified-organic]] [[shrimp]] farm.
