===<u><big>Potawot</big></u>===
The Diabetes program available at Potawot covers nine tribes and more than 13,000 American Indians, consisting mainly of Yurok, Weeot and Tolowa Tribal members. Potawot hosts United Indian Health Services' (UIHS) nationally recognized tobacco awareness and diabetes prevention programs which are featured at the Health Village. <ref name="Potawot">http://pages.prodigy.net/richardspini/_wsn/page5.html Potawot Info Services Last Accessed: 10/28/08</ref> Because diabetes has become such a severe problem in the community, and throughout the world, Potawot and the UIHS have begun to take steps to address the problem (Fig. 2). The Potawot diabetes outreach program allows its participants to join groups that go on walks (Fig. 3 through 5) Monday through Wednesday during clinic hours. <ref name="Piefer">Interview of Barbara Piefer from Potawot 10/28/08 (707) 825-4180 (Interviewed by [[User:Crazapes7|Juliene Sinclair]]and [[User:Yuvizela|Yuvizela Martinez]]) </ref> Members of Potawot also have the opportunity to join nutritional garden (Fig. 6 through 8) activities. The community food garden at Potawot consists of a two acre organic garden which produces 6-10 tons of fresh produce per year. It is distributed to the Indian community through produce stands, baskets, and other gardening outreach programs.<ref name="UIHS">http://www.uihs.org/ns/services.html UIHS Last Accessed: 10/28/08</ref>


====<u>What is Diabetes?</u>==== 
There are many reasons why Potawot and UIHS try to help educate as many individuals as they can. One of the main reasons is because of the how diabetes affects an individual. Diabetes is a disease that affects the way an individual’s body uses food for energy. Normally, the sugar an individual takes in is digested and broken down to a simple sugar, known as glucose. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps move the glucose into cells. A healthy pancreas adjusts the amount of insulin based on the level of glucose. However, if an individual has diabetes, the process breaks down, and blood sugar levels become too high. People with Type 1 diabetes are completely unable to produce insulin, and people with Type 2 diabetes can produce insulin, but their cells don't respond to it. <ref name="About">http://diabetes.about.com/od/whatisdiabetes/p/whatisdiabetes.htm About.com Accessed: 10/28/08</ref> Due to the problems that diabetes causes, Diabetic patients at Potawot have their eating habits monitored as closely as possible. Clients of the Diabetic program are also encouraged to participate in more rigorous exercise routines. 



====<u>Programs</u>====
Diabetic Native Americans and family members, who are UIHS members or enrolled at the Potawot health clinic, have a wide variety of activities and information available to them. Diabetics are provided with many different opportunities to enhance their health beyond dietary improvements.  Their choices range from exercise and group sessions to one-on-one counseling. 
<p>The Potawot diabetes outreach program also provides members with a monthly luncheon, entitled Repchem. The Repchem luncheon is for members who are at risk or already have diabetes, along with their family members. The Repchem luncheon is held on every second Wednesday from 11 am to 1 pm at Potawot. The Repchem luncheons consists of a presentation on healthy lifestyle choices followed by a nutritious lunch.<ref name="UIHS"/> The nutritious lunch includes native foods such as fish, fruits, and fresh vegitables.<ref name="Piefer"/> </p>
