=Materials efficiency improvements from semiconductor applications=

# solid state switches, relays instead of mechanical
# graphene for use in ultra-capacitors
# [[PV]] and organic PV over fossil fuel use
# [[OLED]] displays reduce need for backlight and are thinner over LCD
# quantum hall effect reduce B necessary
# Multi-functional materials - e.g. PV for building materials -- that can reduce overall building material use
# more advanced PV cuts material use in the PV but also the BOS
# PV replacement of batteries
# size reduction on electronics
# mutliuse devices -- see for example the long list of devices potentially eliminated with [[Hardware replaced by a smartphone]]
# remote energy savings - control furnace from airport
# thermostat controls



=Energy efficiency improvements from semiconductor applications=
# [[hybrid electric vehicles]]
# [[LED]] over both [[CFL]] and incandescent lighting
# [[photovoltaics]]
# more efficient inverters, DC/DC converters
# quantum hall effect reduces energy use in elecro-magnet
# reduced power usage in computers - via Quantum spin hall effect
# travel to stores - e-shopping
# travel for social interaction, education, work (telecommuting), banking, commerce, etc.
