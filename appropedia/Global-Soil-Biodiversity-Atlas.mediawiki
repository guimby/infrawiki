The '''Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas''' produced by the EU Joint Research Centre/European Soil Data Centre was officially launched at the second UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi on 25 May 2016.<ref name="JRC">http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/content/globa-soil-biodiversity-atlas</ref> It is the first such soil atlas to map the soil biodiversity across the whole planet.

The many soil organisms are analysed within the Atlas. It includes many photos and illustrations and is as much an encyclopedia on the soil as it is an atlas. Threats to soil health are also covered.
