'''Some for-profit publishers use open licenses''' - see the sortable table at [[CC:Books (detailed table)]], which lets you compare published books by license and publisher..

More typically, publishers and authors fear that if they open their content, they will not maintain control, and others may publish the work, competing and diluting the profits. Some have more bravely chosen this path. 

==Case studies==

=== David Pogue ===

http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/technology/personaltech/17pogue-email.html?_r=2&8cir&emc=cira1 Should e-Books Be Copy Protected?], NYTimes.com, David Pogue, December 17, 2009.
When author David Pogue expressed concern about piracy, readers told suggested that perhaps "the illegal copies are just advertising for you; people will download them, try them out, then go by the physical book. Either that, or they're being downloaded by people who would not have bought your book anyway. Why don't you try a controlled experiment and see?"

Pogue and his publisher, O'Reilly, decided to try, and offered one of his Windows books for sale as an unprotected [[PDF]].

After a year, it was all over the Web, extremely easy to download without paying.

However, sales of the book did not fall - in fact they rose slightly during the year.

=== Music ===

Music files are no longer copy protected, and the music companies are still profitable.{{expand}}

== Conclusions ==

Is it too early to draw a conclusion? If there is one, it is perhaps that profit is possible, but there are risks.
