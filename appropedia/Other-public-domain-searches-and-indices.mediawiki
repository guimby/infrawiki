'''Appropedia's [[Public Domain Search]]''' is intended to be as complete as possible. However, there are some results which can't be included for technical reasons. These are listed here. 

* [http://www.publicdomainreprints.org/search.shtml Public Domain Reprints]:
:* The Google books search for books that are marked off as "Full View" books in Google, which in theory should mean they are public domain.{{fact}} However, sometimes these have a "Copyright material" watermarked. In any case, make sure of the copyright/public domain status before using the content. 
:*  Internet Archive search - more reliable results. It is hoped to include results from this in Appropedia's [[Public Domain Search]].
