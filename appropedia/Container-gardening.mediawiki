'''Container gardening''' is more flexible than garden beds. You can sow seed in the container, and if needed you can move the container from a very sheltered position to a more exposed and sunny position when it's ready. (Not too exposed of course! If you're unsure, test and see if the plants cope with the wind and sun.) 

Container gardening is ideal for urban locations with limited space. Lettuce, baby spinach and other greens can be grown in a window box or pot. Cherry tomatoes or dwarf tomatoes can be grown in a pot on a porch in a [[balcony garden]]. Even if the number of plants is small, you'll enjoy the freshness of the produce.
