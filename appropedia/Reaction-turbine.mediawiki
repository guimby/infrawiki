'''Reaction Turbines''' are turbines used in [[hydroelectric]] power. These turbines are used commonly in situations where the water has a medium to low head, and a fairly high flow rate. The water from the comes in to the [[turbines]] at a right angle to the blades. Rather than exiting opposite where the water enters it is channeled into the center and then down through the turbine at 90 degrees from where it entered. The reaction turbine can also be used in applications of low water pressure.
