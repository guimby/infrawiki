'''Biogeography''' is the study of the geographic distribution of [[species]] and [[ecosystems]]. The natural geographic distribution of related species provides evidence for [[evolution]]. Movement of the continents explains much about the origins and dispersal of life forms across Earth. Other explanations for the variations and distributions of species can be explained through glaciation, extinctions and speciation. Isolation of species and the availability of energy resources form part of the studies of biogeography.
