If you have more than a single PV panel, or more than a single source of power ([[Wind power|wind]] and PV) then you need a charge controller.  This piece of hardware will provide the battery (or batteries) with the optimal current to keep them charged.  More expensive models may have a number of other features like:

*LED charge status indicators
*temperature compensation charging
*overvoltage protection
*low voltage alarm
*high voltage disconnect 
*high temperature disconnect
*lightning and transient surge protection

If you only have one panel and one battery, you can leave the system in permanent circuit, with a constant trickle charge to the battery.  I have had such a system sitting basically idle for five years now, doing just fine. --[[User:ericblazek|Eric]] 27 April 2006
:This depends on the size of your panel and battery.  A large panel that has an IV curve showing significant current above the 14.5V range can destroy a small battery or even a large battery with small or infrequent loads.  A very simple charge controller, i.e. just a voltage regulator, is very important in any RE/battery system. --[[User:201.135.20.155|201.135.20.155]] 05:42, 1 July 2006 (PDT)
