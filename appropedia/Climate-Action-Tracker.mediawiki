The '''Climate Action Tracker''' (CAT) is a tool that tracks the emissions commitments of countries, along with their reported actions to reduce emissions. It is an independent, science-based assessment tool.<ref name="CAT">http://climateactiontracker.org/</ref>

The individual state pledges, targets and Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) concerning the emissions of greenhouse gases are assessed regularly, along with policies currently in place for each country.<ref name="CAT" />

== The composition of CAT ==

As noted above, CAT is an independent scientific analysis. Four different research organisations contribute to its tracking data, in order to discern the current global efforts towards keeping global warming beneath 2ÂºC.<ref name="CAT2">http://climateactiontracker.org/about.html</ref> This has been their goal since 2009.<ref name="CAT2" />

The research organisations contributing to CAT are Climate Analytics, Ecofys, NewClimate Institute and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).<ref name="CAT2" />

== What CAT does ==

CAT follows the efforts of 32 countries at this stage.<ref name="CAT2" /> These 32 countries are considered to cover 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name="CAT2" /> This covers approximately 70 percent of the world's population.<ref name="CAT2" />

CAT looks at the effect of current country policies on greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of pledges, targets and INDCs on national emissions until at least 2030 and aims to cover the "fair share and comparability of effort", to determine whether or not a government is doing its fair share in comparison with other countries.<ref name="CAT2" />

CAT also calculates the consequences of global warming and emissions gaps.<ref name="CAT2" /> This involves examining the total global effort of INDCs, pledges and current policies in relation to expected global warming during the 21st century and emissions gaps.

== Using CAT ==

CAT is a useful research tool and source of data, for school and college research, for work, non-profit and community research and for explanation and analysis purposes.
