==Specific technology==
In many organizations, significant resources are allocated to having employees travel to meet new and existing clients. The financial and productivity costs of having employees conduct much of their business with these clients can be dramatically reduced by desktop videoconferencing (DVC); essentially a video- and voice-enabled conversation over the internet between two or more parties. Using [[appropriate technologies]] such as a webcam, microphone and speakers or headset, combined with document sharing software, these meetings can take place from each party's respective office. This analysis explores the potential economic benefits allowed by converting a portion - or all - of your employee's meetings from traveled meetings to DVC.

==ECM Inputs==
This calculator is set up in such a way that the user enters information about several typical meetings that may be recurring each year. This includes:
*The number of people traveling to the meeting
*The length of the meeting (not including travel time)
*Total travel distance and mode of transportation (car, train or airplane)
*Number of nights stay in a hotel required
*Annual frequency of each particular meeting
*Information regarding cost of employees (wages), cost of hardware and software, as well as training the workforce.
*etc.

==ECM Assumptions==
*Assumptions around average travel speeds, costs and CO2 emissions for each mode of transport are made
*Number of meetings the average employee attends each year (used in calculating number of unique attendees)
*''Assumptions of average travel speeds and cost of travel (per km) to be confirmed''
