'''Practical Action Technical Briefs''' are a form of [[technical information for development]] from the pioneering [[appropriate technology]] organization, [[Practical Action]] in the [[UK]].

These cover a wide range of information, often relating to [[village-level]] [[industry]], [[commerce]] and [[agriculture]].

These are being [[Appropedia:Porting|ported to Appropedia]], to enable wider sharing. Many have already been ported and can be found in [[:Category:PATB]].
