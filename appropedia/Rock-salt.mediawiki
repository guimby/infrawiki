This type of [[salt]] comes in large chunky crystals and is intended primarily for use in home ice cream churns to lower the temperature of the ice filled water in which the churn sits. It's also sometimes used in icing down beer kegs. It is used in food preservation by some, but none of the brands I have been able to find label it as food grade so I would not use it for this purpose.
