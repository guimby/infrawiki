<center>I've been working with electric bikes  for almost 3 years now and as I was browsing my favorite site looking for new ideas I stumbled upon a electric mountain board and started doing research. I started becoming more and more interested in working with rc motors and finally took the plunge making one for myself. ''</center>

==Parts== 
Board: MBS Comp 95x from MBS Mountainboards. 

Motor: Turnigy SK3 6364 from [http://www.asiatees.com AsiaTees]

Sprockets : Scooter sprocket and Motor Sprocket from [http://www.electricscooterparts.com Electric Scooter Parts]

Aluminum pieces: from the scrap yard 

The batteries, controller, and throttle were all ordered from  [http://www.asiatees.com AsiaTees]

Batteries: Two 22.2v 5Ah lipo batteries. 

Controller: 150amp car ESC 

Throttle: Wireless 2.4 ghz

Other parts: Wire, electrical tape, wire connectors, nuts and bolts, zip ties, tie down straps.

|1| Gather your needed parts and supplies.  Most important determine which motor you want and what board you want to use. Also you will need these tools. 
Tools Used: 
Socket set,
Sawhorses,
Hacksaw (or equivalent), 
Hammer,
Adjustable wrenches,
Hex key wrenches,
Pliers,
Clamps,
Drill and bits,
Grinder ( or equivalent), 
Metal files,
Wire stripper,
Chain breaker, 
soldering iron.

|2|  Went to the scrap yard and found some aluminum L-channel. This is what I used to make motor mount/bracket piece form.

|3| I measured, cut and drilled the holes for the mount using the truck as your template since it will be bolted to the truck using the pre-existing brake mounting holes.

|3b| I also cut a v out of the center to allow for the mount to sit flush and allow for side to side movement of the truck.

|4| Using pieces cut from the aluminum,  a piece scavenged from another project I was able to come up with this mount. ( This will be different for everyone ) Once the mount was made I mounted the motor using the mounting screws that were provided.

|5| Using the brake disc provided with the mountain board as a mount for the drive sprocket I drilled the holes and bolted it up making sure there was enough space for the chain to clear.

|6| After I mounted the drive sprocket  to the wheel  I installed the motor side sprocket and the chain. ( NOTE* You need to grind down a flat spot on the motor shaft so that the set screw has a flat surface to lock down on.) Also check for chain alignment before tightening down the set screw.

|7| I mounted the controller using industrial 3m velcro as well as the receiver for the wireless remote.

|8| After getting everything mounted and ready I hooked up the batteries in parallel to give me 22.2v 10ah and used Velcro strapping to hold it to the board.
