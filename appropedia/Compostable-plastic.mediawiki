'''Compostable plastic''' is made from organic materials such as [[cornstarch]] and can be composted with no harmful impact to the soil or wider environment.{{fact}}

By breaking down, it:
* reduces the buildup of litter in rivers and drains, thus reducing [[flood]] risk. 
* reduces [[marine pollution]]
* reduces [[air pollution]]
* potentially reduces [[waste management]] dilemmas, if other packaging material also changes to [[compost]]able forms - see ''[[Compostable packaging]]''. 

== Biodegradable versus compostable ==

Some plastics may biodegrade to small fragments of petrochemical-based plastic, reducing but not eliminating their negative impact on the environment.{{fact}}

True compostable materials break down completely into the kinds of materials typically found in compost.

== Standards ==

ASTM International,{{w|ASTM International}} an international standards organization, defines testing methods for biodegradable plastic, in anaerobic and aerobic conditions and marine environments.<ref>http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/D2096.htm</ref>. There are three ASTM standard specifications addressing biodegradable plastics in composting environments:
* ASTM D6400-04 Standard Specification for Compostable Plastics,<ref>http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6400.htm</ref>
* ASTM D6868 - 03 Standard Specification for Biodegradable Plastics Used as Coatings on Paper and Other Compostable Substrates,<ref>http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6868.htm</ref>
* ASTM D7081 - 05 Standard Specification for Non-Floating Biodegradable Plastics in the Marine Environment.<ref>http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7081.htm</ref>
