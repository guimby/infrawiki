==Description==
In the Practivistas Dominicana program, each student lives with a unique family in Santo Domingo, while studying with local students in the prestigious UNIBE and working in one of three different barrios on a project team with locals tackling real problems with existing resources. The program is an intense six week immersion in many different aspects of Dominican culture along a wide breadth of socioeconomic classes. Students are expected to be, and received as, contributing members looking to learn how to improve living systems together. 

In the summer of 2011, students studied appropriate technology and Spanish while working with community members of La Yuca to build a [[La Yuca ecoladrillo schoolroom| schoolroom from plastic bottles and concrete]], lit with [[La Yuca small scale renewable energy|solar and homemade wind power]] from bike parts and newspaper press waste, that catches its own [[La Yuca rainwater catchment|rainwater for cleaning and possibly drinking]].

In the summer of 2012, students returned to Santo Domingo to continue our learning and community collaboration. Students worked with community members of La Yuca to make the [[La Yuca Small Scale Renewable Energy 2012|renewable energy system]] from bikeparts and newspaper press waste more hurricane safe and durable, and to make the [[La Yuca rainwater catchment 2012|rainwater catchment]] more potable and tested. In addition, students worked in Las Malvinas II to build a [[Las Malvinas ecoladrillo schoolroom 2012|classroom]] from plastic bottles, concrete, sawdust, papercrete and industrial wood waste for 25 young students.

In the summer of 2013, students returned again to Santo Domingo. Students and community members worked together to design and construct:
* Rainwater catchment for all the water needs of an urban school ([[La Yuca rainwater catchment 2013]]) and a rural community center ([[Las Malvinas rainwater catchment system]]).
* Solar power for lighting an urban schoolroom (La Yuca) all of the electricity for an off-grid stray animal shelter ([[Ghetto2Garden solar power]]).
* Natural plaster from clay, sand and flour, and other improvements to an urban schoolroom we built from plastic bottles in 2011 ([[La Yuca schoolroom renovation]]).
* A rural public pharmacy (Las Malvinas) made from plastic bottles ([[Las Malvinas botica popular ecoladrillo 2013]]) and blocks made of rice husks, rice husk ash, lime, cement, and sand ([[Las Malvinas botica popular hullkrete 2013]]).

In the summer of 2014 the students collaborated with three communities in Santo Domingo. The students and community members worked together to create:
*[[Arroyo Norte sustainable market materials|Sustainable market materials]] in Arroyo Norte. This was the first year that the practivistas got to work with the community of Arroyo Norte.
*An improved [[La Yuca rainwater 2014|rainwater catchment system]] for the La Yuca schoolroom, a [[Las Malvinas rainwater feasibility study 2014|feasibility study]] for a potential rainwater catchment system in Las Malvinas, and a [[Las Malvinas rainwater 2014|rainwater catchment system]] for a pharmacy in Las Malvinas.
*A [[Las Malvinas community center shade|shade structure]] made from bamboo, bilboard material, and zinc for the community center in Las Malvinas.
*A series of tests on various [[Hullkrete and fiber-crete|eco-blocks]] to assess the potential of cinder blocks that use less concrete and more of materials like sawdust, paper, and coconut.
*A [[Las Malvinas destacamento|destacamento]] (police station) in Las Malvinas made with some of the eco-blocks created in the community.
*A [[La Yuca renewable energy 2014|renewable energy system for the La Yuca schoolroom]], and a [[Ghetto2Garden renewable energy 2014|renewable energy system for Ghetto2Garden]].

This program is open to all skill levels, but does require some ability to do manual work and move around. Expect to work hard, learn a bunch, build lasting projects and friendships.
