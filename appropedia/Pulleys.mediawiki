==Abstract==
* This OSAT is a heavy-duty rope pulley that can be used to raise water from a well <ref> web page: Appropedia Pulley Main Page, Available: http://www.appropedia.org/Pulley</ref>. This pulley can be customized to any desired size, and can be paired with multiples of itself to further increase mechanical advantage.
