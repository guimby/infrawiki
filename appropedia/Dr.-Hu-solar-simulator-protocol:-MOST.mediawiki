==Calibration==
Machine should be precalibrated to approximately 1.0 kW/sq. meter, however this is only within about two inches away from the front of the solar sim.  In other words your samples will be getting exactly one sun as long as they are within two inches of the solar simulator.  The solar simulator will give less radiation the farther away your samples are from the front of the machine.
