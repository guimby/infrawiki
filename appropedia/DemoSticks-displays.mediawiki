===Inexpensive Display System===
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can create an inexpensive, attractive display of objects and text using modular units 
made from sticks and steel wire. This display system is easy to build and transport. The construction is based on the [[Demo Camp Units]].

DemoSticks Modular Display


----

===Key Features ===
NGOs with limited budgets can communicate their message to the
public using an eye-catching and attractive display system. This free-standing, modular exhibit system, like those commercially available, is easy to construct, has a flexible design, is lightweight, and takes up a minimum of storage space.

=== Required Materials ===

*Steel wire (gauge 2.0 mm) for hooks. The cost is about 100 Euro per 25 kg (50 meters of wire per kg)  
*Steel wire (gauge 0.5 mm) for cross-wire 
*Select wire of a hard quality. Wire which is springy and not easy to bend is ideal.

=== Construction Method  ===

The modular display system is set up from identical sticks and metal cross-wire, which forms towers and cubes. These modular units interconnect to allow you to create any design. You can hook transparent folders containing graphics onto these elements. You can also suspend objects within the system.
