==Governing Principles==
Like most organizations the Jewish World Watch has a board that decides whether or not the actions of JWW follow the overall goal of the group. They have created a set of Governing principles which are listed on their website. <ref name= jewish> </ref>  They are as follow:

'''1.''' All members of JWW have at least one member on the Governing Council and all members have one vote on the Governing Council.

'''2.''' Concerning the decision making of the Governing Council:

A. The Governing Council may delegate decision making to its Chair under the following circumstances: guiding the day to day operations of JWW.

B. In the event that a decision must be made under circumstances that will not allow for a full meeting of the Governing Council. These include but are not limited to, response to funders, response to the media and event related decisions.

C. The Governing Council will strive for consensus in all its decisions but if consensus cannot be reached then a vote of two thirds of those present is needed to make a decision.

'''3.''' The Synagogue Advisory Committee will identify the action priorities for JWW on an annual basis. At the request of any member of the Governing Council, the Governing Council will review its priorities prior to its annual review. The Synagogue Advisory Council will use the following criteria to guide its discussion of those priorities:

A. The need is generated by genocide or other similarly egregious abuse of human rights;
B. there is an urgent need to respond;

C. there is an identifiable goal;

D. JWW can have a meaningful impact on the need;

E. it fulfills the mission of the JWW; and

F. JWW has sufficient resources to implement a meaningful response.

'''4.''' The Governing Council will identify the fundraising goals of JWW in conjunction with each action priority. Those fundraising goals will be determined and reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Governing Council. Among the considerations to be used by the Governing Council in both its determination of fundraising goals and its review of those goals are:

A.JWW can have a meaningful impact on the need;

B. JWW can link its fundraising efforts to its education efforts;

C. there is a strong likelihood of success in raising funds;

D. JWW can identify and implement multiple fundraising strategies to meet the goal; and

E. it advances the mission of the JWW.<ref name= jewish> </ref>
