'''Nutrients''' are chemical elements and compounds found in the environment that plants and animals need to grow and survive. For water-quality investigations the various forms of [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are the nutrients of interest. The forms include [[nitrate]], [nitrite], [[ammonia]], [[organic nitrogen]] (in the form of plant material or other [[organic compounds]]), and [[phosphates]] ([[orthophosphate]] and others). Nitrate is the most common form of nitrogen and phosphates are the most common forms of phosphorus found in [[natural waters]]. High concentrations of nutrients in water bodies can potentially cause [[eutrophication]] and [[hypoxia]].
