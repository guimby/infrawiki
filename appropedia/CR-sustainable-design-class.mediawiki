===Sustainable Design Kick-Off Course Approach===
The goal of this Sustainable Design kick-off course was to use [[Open Space Technology]], a highly interactive and sustainable workshop form, to engender the following outcomes:
*	Introduce and define Sustainable Design
*	Recommend Sustainable Design curriculum content and format
*	Identify approaches to Sustainable Design in the past, present and future
These outcomes are depicted in the Course Outcomes section.

===Participant Introduction===
The College of the Redwoods, Hoopa Sustainable Design course participants are incredibly diverse in goals, backgrounds, and ethnicities. 

====Student Goals====
Student goals for this class center on gaining applied skills to design projects for either their personal or work lives. Specific interests are depicted in the Course Outcomes section. In addition, some students decided to complete this three month intensive course to obtain Certifications that will foster future employment opportunities.

====Backgrounds====
The backgrounds and interests of Sustainable Design course students are broad ranging. Their backgrounds and interests include, but are by no means limited to: anthropology, construction, art therapy, music, photography, and motion pictures.

====Ethnicities====
These students are from California, New York, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Texas, Mexico, Ireland and the Philippines. Many participants represent tribes from across the United States, including: Yurok, Hopi, Hoopa, Karuk, Pauite, Tule River, Yokut, Havasu Lake, Chemehuevi, and Pueblo/Navajo.

===Course Outcomes===
====Sustainable Design Definition====
A holistic process to plan specific projects, considering short and long term implications, that promotes health for all involved in the system, such as: individuals, cultures, ecosystems, governments, and economies. 

====Sustainable Design Program Curriculum Recommendations====
Content recommendations:
*	Indigenous cultures as a model (respect/balance)
*	Home construction
**	General design considerations
**	Straw bale 
**	Log houses
*	Hydro-electric and solar power
*	[[UABJO_Demonstration_Wetland_Wastewater_Treatment,_Reclamation,_and_Outreach|Black and grey water treatment systems]]
*	Laws and regulations on course topic areas, and approach to pursuing exceptions
Format recommendations:
*	Address course topics in-depth first (academic presentation of core concepts), then become directly engaged  afterward (site visits, hand-on projects, etc)
*	Invite more expert guest speakers

====Applications of Sustainable Design in the Past, Present and Future====
As a part of the open space format of the course, students groups selected their own topics addressing applied past, present and future sustainable designs. These topics were selected as part of the theme: “Promoting healthy individuals, our schools, our communities and the environment through sustainable design- now and for the future.”  Specific focus areas are illustrated in Figure 1, and depicted in additional detail below. <br>
