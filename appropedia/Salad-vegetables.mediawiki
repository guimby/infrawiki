'''Salad vegetables''' are vegetables that are typically used to create salads. While salads are mostly raw, some salads are also cooked (such as potato or beetroot salads) and even served warm.

Salad vegetables are often seasonal, although with the use of containers, a greenhouse or indoor growing, it is possible to grow salad vegetables all year round.
