[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_ether Dimethyl ether] (DME) can be a diesel substitute. Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn DME. It is also used as a low-temperature solvent and extraction agent.

Dimethyl Ether ([[DME]]) is created by the dehydration of two [[methanol]] molecules methanol across an alumina catalyst.

'''2 CH3OH --> H2O + CH3OCH3'''

DME can be created in two steps with the creation of [[methanol]] across ZnO and CuO, then its dehydration to DME in the presence of Al2O3.

DME can also be synthesized in a single step which is typically a combination of both catalysts, ZnO/CuO and Al2O3. When the synthesis of [[methanol]] and [[methanol]] dehydration happen in the same step, an interesting third reaction interaction happens: the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_gas_shift water-gas shift].
