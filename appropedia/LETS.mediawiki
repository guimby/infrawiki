'''Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)''' also known as LETSystems are local, [[non-profit]] exchange networks in which goods and services can be traded without the need for printed currency. 

LETS networks use interest-free local credit so direct swaps do not need to be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other local currencies, no scrip is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered [[mutual credit systems]].
