the processes which

largely inadvertent activities of humans. A growing number of peer reviewed publications have adopted the terminology <ref>Citing Zalasiewicz are

==Popularization of the concept==

There have been books with tittles that emphasize this point. Examples include
â€œThe .End of Ancient Sunlightâ€ by Tom Hartman, which emphasizes that the
ancient
carboniferous fossil fuel deposits will no longer provide viable energy sources.
Another is by Bill McKibben, ''The End of Nature''. The point to that is that nature
is no longer entirely natural, it is not nature as such but rather nature as it
manages to survive the actions of humans.

The word designating this new situation is a designation for a whole new era in
geologic time: the Anthropocene Era. This indicates that it is the activities of
humanity which determines the fate of the planet.

Another title, ''The Permanent Emergency'', underscores that radical new approaches
will be required insofar as the situation is an emergency. Moreover, the
problems won't go away anytime soon. What little light there is at the end of
the tunnel is largely dependent upon technology, but unfortunately there is
still a great deal of resistance to those very measures â€“ research and
development â€“ which are essential to save the planet.
