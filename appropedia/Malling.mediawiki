== West Malling and its surrounding area ==

West Malling is an historic mediaeval market town based in West [[Kent]], with a hinterland consisting of the parishes of Addington; Birling; East Malling; Kings Hill; Larkfield; Leybourne; Mereworth; Offham; Ryarsh; Trottiscliffe.

The area is unusual in that East Malling, Larkfield and Kings Hill are substantial communities with their own shops and facilities â€“ however they provide the main commercial and industrial estates, leaving West Malling as a traditional market town offering retail shops, services and hospitality to the surrounding area. There are more than 500 businesses in the Malling area.

The parishes are within the Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council (offices at Kings Hill). The town is actually closer to Maidstone, County Town of Kent, than to Tonbridge; however both are substantial centres within easy reach of West Malling. <ref>[[wikia:sca21:MAP Action plan 2009-2011#Introduction]]</ref>
