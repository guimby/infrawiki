This article explores a new open-source method for developing and manufacturing high-quality scientific equipment suitable for use in virtually any laboratory. A syringe pump was designed using freely available open-source computer aided design (CAD) software and manufactured using an open-source [[RepRap]] 3-D printer and readily available parts. The design, bill of materials and assembly instructions are globally available to anyone wishing to use them. Details are provided covering the use of the CAD software and the RepRap 3-D printer. The use of an open-source [[Raspberry Pi]] computer as a wireless control device is also illustrated. Performance of the syringe pump was assessed and the methods used for assessment are detailed. The cost of the entire system, including the controller and web-based control interface, is on the order of 5% or less than one would expect to pay for a commercial syringe pump having similar performance. The design should suit the needs of a given research activity requiring a syringe pump including carefully controlled dosing of reagents, pharmaceuticals, and delivery of viscous 3-D printer media among other applications.

==Materials and Tools==

 Note: This page describes the mechanical build and software installation.  The paper describes the electronics as it was originally implemented.  This method is not maintained anymore.  It is now recommended to use a 3-D printer controller such as a RAMPS or Melzi and [[Franklin]] to control the device. The old method is detailed in the Discussion tab of this page.

==Controller: Connection and Calibration==
This is a description for using [[Franklin]] to control the device. Latest version available for free [https://github.com/mtu-most/franklin Github]. 

(The paper describes the electronics as it was originally implemented.  This method is no longer maintained.  It is now recommended to use a RepRap 3-D printer controller such as a RAMPS or Melzi, which you can pick up online and Franklin to control the device. The original instructions are available in the Discussion tab.)

The motor must be connected to the control board on the terminals that are intended for the first axis (normally called X).  In Franklin, load the profile for the board you have, then set up the profile and calibrate the pump:
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump01.png|thumb|right|Set the nuber of temps to 0, position axes to 1, and extruders and followers to 0.]]Set the nuber of temps to 0, position axes to 1, and extruders and followers to 0.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump02.png|thumb|right|Disable both limit switches.]]Disable both limit switches.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump03.png|thumb|right|Set the coupling to 100 step/mm and the speed limit to 20 mm/s.]]Set the coupling to 100 step/mm and the speed limit to 20 mm/s.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump04.png|thumb|right|Home the pump.]]Set the switch position to 0, then home the pump. This sets the current position to the switch position.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump05.png|thumb|right|Select the x position input.]]Select the x position input. Then press arrow up and down to move the pump in small steps page up and down to move it in larger steps.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump06.png|thumb|right|Change the direction, if required.]]The pump should push liquid out when moving in the positive direction.  If it is moving in the wrong direction, invert it.
#{{clear}}Pull the syringe out slightly past a big marker. Then using tiny steps, push the syringe to the bigger marker so the plunger is exactly on the mark. (Because of backlash, you want to do the entire procedure with pushing only.)
#Click the home button to set the position to 0.
#Push it further until you reach another marker (larger distance is better).  Make sure to do small steps at the end, in order to make sure you do it by pushing only.
#Record the current position.
#Divide the reported number of mm times the coupling by the number of milliliters between the markers.  This is the correct Coupling value for this syringe.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump07.png|thumb|right|Save the profile.]]After setting the correct coupling, adjust the maximum speed to a value that works (if it is too high, the motor will skip) and name and save the profile.  Also set this profile as default.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump08.png|thumb|right|Export the profile.]]Right-click on the export link and save the target to a location on your computer where you can find it.  Use this file to restore the profile if you need it.
#{{clear}}[[File:MOST_pump09.png|thumb|right|Change the units.]]If you want the interface to be correct (of course you do), open the profile in a plain text editor and change the unit_name setting from mm to mL.  Save it and import the new settings.  Note how all the units in the interface change.

{{clear}}
The pump is now ready to use. You can use the x position entry to move it manually, or upload G-Code which moves the X coordinate to move it in a pre-programmed pattern.  A simple G-Code example is:

 <nowiki>
G91            ; Use relative positioning.
G1 X10 F600    ; Push 10 mL at 600 mL/min (10 mL/s).
G1 X1 F120     ; Push 1 mL at 100 mL/min (2 mL/s).
G4 P500        ; Wait 500 ms.
G1 X1          ; Push another mL at the same speed.
G1 X10 F600    ; Repeat.
G1 X1 F120
G0 X-5         ; Pull back 5 mL at maximum speed.</nowiki>

== Minimum Pump Rate==
The minimum pump amount is a single step of the motor; how much that is depends on the size of the syringe. Here the lead screw has a pitch of 0.8mm and the motor does 3200 microsteps per revolution, so one step is a plunger movement of 0.8mm/3200=250nm.  The cross section of a 25ml syringe is around 4cm², so one step is the product of those, which is 0.1mm³=0.1μL.

There is no minimum value for the speed that the pump can go, but if you get near the step size, the flow will be in noticeable steps instead of continuous.  For example, if you want 1μL/min, it will do one step every 6 seconds.
