'''Information silos''' prevent [[knowledge sharing]] - it is the very opposite of [[open sustainability]], and [[open knowledge for aid and international development]]. 

When [[environmental organizations]], [[aid organizations]] and [[development organizations]] act in a proprietary way towards their knowledge, this creates an information silo - information which cannot be shared, remixed, improved or freely used. This restrictions inhibits education, the flow of knowledge, and creativity.

== What not to do ==

Information silos can occur through:
* Thinking that information related to your aid and development projects is only of interest to your organization.
* Enforcing copyright
* Making no clear license statement, which in most countries makes the work copyright due to the [[Berne Convention]].{{w|Berne Convention}}
* Granting limited permission, e.g. for [[non-commercial clause|non-commercial]] and [[education]]al use. This enables only simple and limited sharing which is not usually of great value beyond sharing your information on the web in the first place.
* Keeping your organization's wisdom on hard drives, internal networks, in filing cabinets, or (even worse) only in your head, rather than sharing on the web.

== How to be open ==

The solution is to:
* Make the information you use internally available online, and 
* Use an [[open license]] (one that allows derivatives and commercial use), and
* Consider contributing directly to a wiki, for example [[Appropedia]]
