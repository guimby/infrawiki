Google used to have a custom search for [[Linux]] (aka GNU/Linux) at <code>google.com/linux</code> but they discontinued it on the basis that it's normally enough to add <code>linux</code> as a search term. However, this custom search is useful:
* if you want to avoid spammy search results
* when searching for a rarely used term such as a model number - such searches often give hits which mention merely Linux in a sidebar or footer etc, but where the page itself is are not actually about Linux. 
By narrowing the search down to only Linux-specific websites, these problems are avoided.
