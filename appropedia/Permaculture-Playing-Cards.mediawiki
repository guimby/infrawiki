'''[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paulwheaton/permaculture-playing-cards Permaculture Playing Cards]''' is a crowdfunded project to produce a deck of playing cards with a permaculture topic described on the face of each card. Contributions earn rewards, including the cards themselves.

The project has reached almost three times its goal, with 11 days to go, so will definitely be funded. It  closes on the morning of Sep 9, 2013.

Paul Wheaton, the project owner, operates [permies.com/ permies.com] and several other sites, and has run several successful crowdfunding projects such as a rocket stove CD set.
