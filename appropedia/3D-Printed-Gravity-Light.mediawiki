==Abstract==
# This project was to replicate the already produced gravity light into the 3D Printed and open source world.

==History of the Project==
So the project was taken from [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gravitylight-lighting-for-developing-countries# Gravity Light], and the goal was to turn this product in to a 3D printable product. The project seems so simple but was very hard to get working. We first started off gather some initial data, and it seem like we were going to need a gear reduction of 1:500 which is a crazy amount. 

So we started off with a small Planetary hand crank [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:287490 light], following the directions and scaling the part by 150% and upping the infill. We had some small success, but ultimately it failed due to high stress in the gears. 

So we then moved to  another larger sized planetary [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727833/#files gears]. At this stage this is our working model, but still has a long way to go. So this prototype is a proof of concept, [https://www.youmagine.com/designs/gravity-lamp gravity light].

== Bill of Materials==
From [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1727833  3d Printed Gears]

#1x Front 
#1x Ring 
#1x Carrier 
#3x Planets 
#3x Washers
#1x Custom Shaft
#1x Bottom Servo Holder 
#1x Top Servo Holder

== Common Problems and Solutions==
Most of our issues were with friction, so that is the reason we could not add more than on planetary gear sets.


== Cost savings==
With it still being in the development phase, and for 50 USD you will get one. Printing this cost upwards of 10 dollars and some parts found in the IEEE lab.
