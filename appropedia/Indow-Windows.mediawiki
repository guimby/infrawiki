==Material and Appearance==
Inserts are hand-crafted out of high grade acrylic glazing and edged with a patented compression tube. These tubes allow the inserts to be easily popped in and out of the frame while maintaining a secure fit. The acrylic glazing comes in five different grades:
* Standard: Great performance & value
* Museum: Blocks 98% of UV rays
* Commercial: Scratch resistant coating
* Acoustic: 70% noise reduction
* Privacy: Transmits light but blocks detail
Indow Windows edging also come in several colors, including black, white and brown. Custom Pantone colors are available for commercial jobs.

==Function and Performance==

Indow Window + single pane performance numbers are from independent testing conducted by [http://greenbuilding.pdx.edu/ Portland State University's Green Building Research Lab].  Actual performance numbers will vary depending on the condition of the single pane window.

* Air infiltration (lower is better): The tight seal between the Indow Windows' spring bulb and your window frame stops cold drafts in their tracks.  Industry leading performance. 
* R Value (higher is better): An Indow Window combined with a single pane window provides 94% of the thermal insulation (R-value) of standard double pane replacement windows.
* Noise Reduction: Indow Windows significantly outperform standard double pane replacement windows in noise reduction.  When placed over a single pane window, Standard Indow Windows dampen noise up to 10dB, which equates to a 50% noise reduction.  Acoustic Grade Indow Windows reduces noise by up to 18.9 dB when placed over a single pane window,  equivalent to a 70%+ reduction. The overall sound reduction depends on sound coming through walls and doors. The reduction will not be as great when Indow Windows are placed over double pane windows.
* Lead: Any house built before 1978 is highly likely to have toxic lead paint hidden in the walls.  Indow Window installations do not disrupt walls so lead is not a worry.
