==Gloves and safety glasses==
Dr. Frost requires everyone who is working in her lab wear gloves and safety glasses.

== Lamps ==
In order to switch the lamps on, you must flip the green switch to on.
*Click start button 
*Wait at least ten minutes for the machine to set up before starting program
*There should be a loud cranking noise, which means that the machine is working correctly.

===Cuvettes===

<gallery>

The reference cuvette is the one that is farthest away from the front of the machine.
*Located near the back of the UV chamber.
A beam of light will be split into two beams
*These beams will shine through your sample and a reference then compare the two wavelengths
The sample cuvette should be placed in the sample cuvette holder
*The sample should be taped as flat as possible against the cuvette's outer layer
**do not tape sample to the inside of the cuvette

Once you have the cuvettes and your samples prepared, autozero and start the machine.

== Export ==
To export click file->export, then pick a destination file to export.  

The most important detail about exporting your data is to switch the Data from "spectrum export file" to "XY Data (raw)"

==Finding the spectroscopy beam==
In order to find out exactly where the UV spectrometer is shining its light, you have to set it to the green wavelength (anywhere from 577-492 nm).  First click the change lambda button, then enter your desired wavelength into the input box, and finally use a slip of paper with the UV spectrometer open to find the few-nanometer-wide slit.
