==Abstract==
Damage to crops by freezing temperatures causes [[crop yield]] losses somewhere         in Ontario every year. Such damages range from cold set-back of alfalfa         in spring to loss of tomatoes in a home garden in the fall. Some of these losses can be prevented. A number of different methods are available for         preventing freeze damage to crops. It is important for growers to be aware         of these so that they can evaluate which procedures are feasible and economical for combating freeze damage. This Factsheet provides some information  on various freeze prevention methods that are available.

The methods are described in terms of active and passive techniques.         Active methods are those which are used when the danger of a freeze is         present and include such techniques as adding heat and covering crops.         Passive methods are those which are used well in advance of the freeze         and include proper scheduling of planting and harvesting within the safe         freeze-free period, proper crop and field selection, among others. Specific         examples of both methods will be discussed in more detail.

The terms frost and freeze are often used interchangeably. In this Factsheet         the word freeze will be used for the subfreezing temperature conditions         that cause crop damage, and has the same meaning as 'killing frost'. The         word frost will refer to the condition that exists when air temperatures         drop to the freezing point of water (00C), or lower, but which         may or may not result in freeze damage to crops.

==Types Of Frost==

Frosts are frequently classified as either advective or radiative, depending         on the atmospheric conditions under which they occur. An advective frost         occurs when cold air from another region moves into an area and winds         remain relatively strong. Radiative frosts are produced locally and occur         only during clear, calm nights (see OMAFRA Factsheet The Behavior of Frost         in Ontario, Agdex 079, Order No. 85-055).

==Effects Of Freezing Temperatures On Crops==

To properly evaluate the benefit of freeze prevention methods it is necessary         to understand the effect of below freezing temperatures on the crop(s)         concerned. Some effects are well known while others are less clear and         require more research. The minimum temperature (known as the "critical"         temperature) which must be reached before damage occurs may be influenced         by many factors. These include plant species, variety, growth or development         stage, plant vigor, soil conditions, surface cover; freeze intensity and         duration; thawing conditions, cloud and wind conditions during the freeze;         and others.

Many plants have less freeze-resistance when they become mature than         during earlier stages of growth. A healthy, growing plant can often withstand         a frost better than a weak plant.

The critical temperatures needed for damage to occur may vary depending         on the duration that temperatures remain below freezing. For example,         buds of fruit trees may be damaged if exposed to -20C for more         than 24 hours, but may survive if exposed to -60C for less         than 2 hours. Thus the critical temperature for a radiative frost lasting         for only a few hours in the early morning may be lower than for an advective         frost which may continue even during daytime hours.

Thawing conditions often affect the extent of damage after a frost. For         example, tobacco leaves which are thawed out gradually after freezing         have been known to suffer less damage than if thawing was rapid.

The effect that freezing temperatures have on crops will vary. In some         cases it results in a total loss of the plant parts affected. For example,         frozen apple blossoms will not produce fruit. In other instances it will         only result in a decline in yield or quality. If potato tops are frozen         prematurely, the result will be only a partial loss in yield and/or quality         of tubers. A premature frost can affect both yield and quality of silage         and grain corn as well as other cereal crops. Sometimes a frost can cause         a decline in the ability to store a crop. For example, partly frozen potatoes         may break down sooner in storage and also cause other healthy tubers to         deteriorate. Whether or not freeze prevention methods are economical will         depend a lot on the amount of loss in crop yield or quality that results         from a frost. Therefore growers should be well aware of the effects of         below freezing temperatures on their crops.

Table 1 indicates approximate critical temperatures for some crops grown         in Ontario. These are temperatures of the crop, not in a weather screen         1.5 metres above ground. Keep in mind that the crop temperature may         be below freezing even though the temperature in the weather screen         is several degrees (C) above freezing. (The opposite is also common for         crops such as potato tubers that are beneath the soil surface.)

==Freeze Protection - Passive Methods==

Passive methods used well in advance of the actual freeze danger are         probably the most economical and effective. Some are really only common         sense and already widely used, but it is nevertheless useful to list them.         Following are some examples of passive methods which can be used.

# '''Site selection''' The land selected to grow a frost-sensitive crop should           have an adequate freeze-free period. For high risk crops, avoid low-lying           fields where cold air tends to drain to and be trapped. Dense windbreaks,           forested areas, road embankments or other obstructions can result in           "pools" of cold air by preventing the cold air from moving           down the slopes. Thus the freeze risk above such obstructions may be           increased. However, freeze risk of land areas below windbreaks situated           along a slope may be reduced since cold air movement from higher ground           is partly prevented. Protective shelterbelts properly located can create           a more favourable climate which will promote earlier maturity in heat-loving           crops and thus reduce the risk of freeze damage in the fall. Locations           near large water bodies are usually less prone to frost as air masses           over water cool less rapidly at night than over land. Coastal areas           frequently experience land breezes at night which help prevent frost.           Planting orchards on north-facing slopes has helped to delay blooming           until the danger of frost is past in some areas. Growers should know the risk of spring and autumn frost in their             area and be aware of the variations that can be expected on their             farms. Typical temperature patterns that exist in both the horizontal             direction as well as vertically above crops under different types             of frost situations have been described in another OMAFRA Factsheet,             The Behavior of Frost in Ontario, Agdex 079. Ideally it is desirable             to know when susceptible plant parts are likely to reach critical             temperatures needed for damage to occur. While much information can             be gained through experience, it may sometimes be helpful to make             measurements of minimum temperature at various locations on the farm,             particularly if the terrain is hilly or if the farm is near a lake.             Temperature records can also be useful for adjusting minimum temperature             forecasts for on-farm conditions. Information from nearby climate             stations may often be helpful in determining frost risk, even though             the station may not always represent on-farm conditions accurately.             In general, it is best to seek assistance from an experienced agricultural             meteorologist or climatologist if temperature data are to be collected             and interpreted.

# '''Land clearing''' Thinning hedgerows or clearing forested areas can sometimes             reduce the risk of frost in sloping terrain by allowing cold air to             drain to lower areas. It is preferable to seek professional advice             before attempting this method since sometimes it can increase frost             risk below the windbreak. In small clearings in forests, the risk             of frost increases with size of clearing up to about one hectare.             However, as clearings become larger than a few hectares the risk of             frost is usually lowered by allowing for more air movement.

# '''Crop management''' Select crop species and varieties which will mature             within the available freeze-free period. For example, when growing             grain corn, hybrids that reach maturity before killing frost should             be selected. If spring frost is a threat to strawberry blossoms, growing             late-flowering varieties or delay removing the straw mulch may help.             Dwarf apple trees may be more likely affected by frost than taller             varieties since air layers near the ground tend to be colder than             at higher levels during nights with frost.

# '''Plant and harvest frost sensitive crops within the available freeze-free period on your farm.''' Plant early enough to ensure crops are mature             before killing frost in the fall. It may be advantageous to take a             slightly bigger risk in spring than in fall with some crops which             can be replanted if freeze damage does occur. Plant around a relatively             low risk date (e.g. one which would result in freeze damage in less             than 1 yr in 10, or 10% risk) rather than the average date which would             result in damage in 5 yrs out of 10 (50% risk). If planting before             the risk of freezing temperatures is over in spring is desirable to             capture early, higher priced markets, then only plant out acreage             which can be protected by one of the active freeze prevention methods.             Know the risk of experiencing frost in spring and fall in the field             in which the crop is being grown. Some plants can be hardened to withstand frost by exposing the seeds             or young seedling plants to varying temperature conditions, although             much of this work is still in the experimental stage. Greenhouse plants             are often hardened by exposure to outside conditions prior to transplanting             in the field. Treatment of seeds with certain chemicals has been shown             to increase hardiness in some plants. Application of proper amounts             of required nutrients can also help to maintain plant hardiness.

# '''Soil management''' The condition of the soil will affect the risk of           freeze damage to both above and below ground plant parts. Loose soil           surfaces reduce conduction of heat to the surface at night and therefore           tend to have lower surface temperatures than compacted soils. Thus it           is advisable not to cultivate the soil just before a killing frost is           expected if plant parts near the ground need to be protected.

Moisture in the soil has some counteracting effects. Excessively             wet soils gain less heat energy during the day as more of the sun's             energy goes into evaporating moisture. This can reduce the heat available             to the crop at night. On the other hand excessively dry soils are             poorer heat conductors and are able to store less heat, and therefore             result in a higher risk of frost. A dry peat soil is a particularly             poor heat conductor and has a very low heat storage capacity, so that             nighttime minimum temperatures over such surfaces may be considerably             lower than over mineral soils. It may be possible to improve the heat             characteristics of peat soil by the addition of mineral soil.

Mulches on the soil surface increase risk of frost by behaving as             insulators. Less heat is absorbed by the soil during the day and less             is released at night. Mulches can help to avoid freeze damage, however,             if they completely cover the sensitive plant parts. Delaying the removal             of straw mulches in strawberries in spring can sometimes help to delay             the bloom date past the time when there is danger of frost. However,             the straw will also delay the warming of the soil, and if it remains             underneath the blossoms at the time of frost, it will increase the             risk of damage.

Cover crops under orchards act similarly to mulches and thus can             increase the risk of frost. They may have other beneficial effects,             however, such as reducing soil erosion, which outweigh the freeze             risk factor.

Covering of plant parts beneath the soil surface with a layer of             soil is a way of protecting against frost. Well-hilled potatoes are             less prone to experience frost damage to tubers than if the hills             are poorly formed. Dry soils cool more rapidly near the surface and             therefore adding moisture to the soil may sometimes help to reduce             risk of frost damage to tubers.

While soil management practices may only provide a few degrees (C)             of protection, even this small amount could affect freeze dates by             1 to 2 weeks or more, and in some cases could mean the difference             between a total loss of the crop and relatively little damage.

The above passive methods of freeze protection are worth taking so             that active methods are not necessary in most seasons because the             latter are expensive and can only be afforded when the crop has a             high value per unit area.

 

==Freeze Protection - Active Methods==

Active protection takes place just before and during the occurrence of         the frost after a warning has been issued in the weather forecast. They         are usually only effective under radiative frost conditions when winds         are light or calm, and are most suitable in low-lying, frost prone areas.         Advective freezes usually cannot be prevented by active means.

It is very important to have good forecasts of on-farm minimum temperature         and wind conditions for active freeze protection. Moreover, knowledge         of the critical temperatures that cause crop damage is needed. Farmers         should know the nighttime temperature variations as they occur over their         land and which fields are most prone to frost, so that action can be taken         in these fields first. The basic concept of these methods is very simple.         They either depend on the reduction of heat loss from the surface, stirring         the air to break up the temperature inversion, or adding heat to maintain         the temperature above the danger point.

In order to determine if it is economical to invest in the equipment,         materials and labor for active freeze protection many factors must be         considered. These include the degree of risk, the likely duration and         severity of frosts, value of the crop, and effectiveness of the method         to be used. Some of the active methods are described below.

#'''Covering''' This method reduces heat loss from the surface. Home gardeners           and growers of small acreages of low-growing commercial crops often           use materials such as straw mulch, boxes, tar paper, plastic, etc. to           reduce the heat loss from the surface. The cost of the materials, their           storage and the time and labour needed to place the covers are the main           drawbacks to this method for large areas of crops. Foams have also been           used experimentally to protect plants but materials and applicators           are not readily available on a commercial basis. Some materials are more effective in reducing radiative heat loss             than others. Clear plastic may transmit some long-wave radiation whereas             dark, opague covers do not. Any cover is effective in reducing heat             loss by convection. When covers are placed, particularly thin materials             such as plastics, care must be taken to prevent contact with the plant             to reduce heat loss by conduction, as the temperature of the exposed             surface is usually lower than the air below it. Straw [[mulches]] should             cover all plant parts as any protruding leaves are more susceptible             to freeze damage. Mulches underneath plants prevent heat coming out             of the soil at night from reaching these plants and thereby result             in lower plant temperatures. Covers should be removed during the day as air humidity would be             higher under the cover and this would increase the danger of certain             plant diseases.
#'''Fog or smoke''' Clouds and fog are well-known for their ability to reduce             radiative heat loss from the surface. Smoke from smudge pots or burning             tires or refuse and mist from fine water nozzles have been used in             attempts to reduce this heat loss. Since it is difficult to maintain             the smoke over the sensitive crop area and to produce droplets the             optimum size to intercept the long-wave radiation, this method is             not very effective. In addition, our environmental laws now prohibit             the use of this method, where smoke is involved.

# '''Wind Machines''' During freezes which occur on calm, clear nights, the             air layer near the ground is colder than the air aloft. This is known             as a temperature inversion. Wind machines or helicopters are sometimes             used to bring the warmer air down to the crop level to replace the             cold air layer at the surface. This method can be effective when there             are large temperature differences between air layers near the surface             and those up higher. Equipment and operating costs are high. Effectiveness             varies in the range of 1 to 4 degrees C.

# '''Sprinkling''' A very low rate of application of water through irrigation             can be effective in preventing freeze damage through the release of             heat during cooling and freezing. Protection from freezing temperatures             as low as -60C have been reported for low growing berry             and vine crops, when 1.5 to 2.5 mm per hour of water was applied.Sprinkling of the crop should begin with the onset of freezing conditions             and a film of water continuously maintained until temperatures have             risen above the freezing level (0 C). If sprinkling is discontinued             prematurely, heat will be drawn from leaves to melt the ice and freeze             damage may result. This method creates another problem if the frost             lasts too long, because the plants must be able to support the added             weight of ice that builds up on the leaves and branches. A forecast             of the duration that temperatures are expected to remain below freezing             is very useful when using this method. In spite of the problems, this method has proven effective for low             growing crops such as strawberries, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, peppers             and squash as well as vine crops and tree fruits. It is important             to recognize that this method only prevents the temperature of the             protected plant from falling below the freezing point. It does not             warm the plant parts nor does it raise the air temperature appreciably.             Moreover, sprinklers need to provide constant, uniform coverage. There is controversy over the use of irrigation as a protection method             prior to frost occurrence. The added moisture has the beneficial effects             of increasing the capacity of the soil to store heat and improving             conduction of heat to the surface. Nevertheless, heating of the soil             during day time is reduced because increased evaporation uses up heat             energy. Moisture may also change the critical temperature which is             needed to cause freeze damage to a crop. Since there are counteracting             factors, a general recommendation cannot be made.
#'''Heating''' This method is intended to add enough heat to the layer of           air surrounding the crop and through radiant heat to the crop to maintain           the temperature above the freezing point. Many small heaters uniformly           spaced throughout the crop are the most effective in doing this. Large           fires or heaters create a "chimney effect" and draw cold air           in at the surface, which may create colder conditions in parts of the           crop area (Figure 1).Fuel costs are high whether solid fuel bricks, oil or propane gas             heaters are used. Capital and labour costs add to the expense and             therefore only crops which have a very high value per unit area can             be protected from frosts using this method. Taller crops such as grapes and tree fruits are protected most effectively.             The best results occur when the air is calm, so that a steep temperature             inversion exists. This method can provide protection from frost as             low as -4C.

==Summary==

Crops can be protected from freeze damage by proper site selection and         certain crop and soil management practices (passive methods) or by taking         action when frost warnings are issued. The various passive and active         methods of freeze prevention are described herein. The terms frost and         freeze are defined and the atmospheric conditions in which active freeze         prevention can be taken. No discussion of the economics of freeze prevention         is included.
