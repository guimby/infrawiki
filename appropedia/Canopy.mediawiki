The '''canopy''' is the top of vegetation that forms a dense, roof-like cover in forest environments. The term canopy can refer to the top of a tree, kelp or algae forest. Tree crowns usually form a canopy in a land forest.

A canopy can also be created in a community of other land plants than trees, such as a woodland, scrub land or a crop. In this case, the crowns are formed by the relevant community of plants.
