<center>''To create innovative and environmentally friendly CO2/lubricant absorption technology for power generation from low temperature industrial waste heat to reduce emissions and costs.''</center>

The Icarus project is a multi-disciplinary project working on an absorption power system for highly efficient power generation from low temperature industrial waste heat.

== Understanding the market ==

The main target group for ICARUS technology is in the lime and cement industries who need this technology to improve efficiency and lower emissions in the industry.   


== Project goals ==

Describe project goals here.

# Create an absorption power generation technology for low temperature (60-120C) heat
# Create a waste-heat power generation system for industrial (chemical, cement) applications that can achieve an efficiency of up to 20% for electricity to be generated from industrial waste heat (<120C) without affecting industrial processes. 
# Offer improved environmental performance and improved efficiency 
# Reduced CO2 emissions at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.

=== Next steps ===

Further technical issues must be solved, but a 20kW system looks like a viable option.

== Conclusions ==

The prototypes have shown that a 20kW system would achieve a payback period of 1 year and 5 months and the GHG emissions cut per year using the 20kW system have been estimated as 88.12 tonnes CO2e in the UK and 124.45 tonnes CO2 in Greece.
