All stock working '''dogs''' are an asset, they don't have to be fancy, just under control, and every one expecation are diffrent as to the work the dog has to do. There are plenty of books, videos, web sites and trainer out there, conatact the local Border Collie Assn. even if interested in another working breed, as they will have contact too for people with other breeds. When looking for a pup, do your homework, ask questions. Good breeder will only be too willing to help out or give contacts, make sure you have time and some stock to train on, ever offer help to a farmer to get some stock knowledge and help with stock for your lesson with your dog. If interested, I will do some short articles and talk people through the basic building block's to train a working dog.
