The '''Owner's Manifesto''' on Makezine.com states:

<blockquote>If you can't open it, you don't own it: a Maker's Bill of Rights to accessible, extensive, and repairable hardware.</blockquote>

The manifesto then lists '''The Maker's Bill of Rights''', including:
* "Meaningful and specific parts lists shall be included" 
* "Cases shall be easy to open," "Special tools are allowed only for darn good reasons"
* "Components, not entire sub-assemblies, shall be replaceable"
* "Consumables, like fuses and filters, shall be easy to access"
* "Circuit boards shall be commented" and
* "Ease of repair shall be a design ideal, not an afterthought"
