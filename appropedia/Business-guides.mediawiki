'''Business guides''' have a place on Appropedia. The ability of people in society to run successful businesses is a key part of [[international development]] - especially [[small businesses|small]] and [[micro businesses]], whether or not supported by [[microfinance]].

E.g. See this advice for running a high-class restaurant ([http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/29/one-hundred-things-restaurant-staffers-should-never-do-part-one/ 100 Things Restaurant Staffers Should Never Do] & [http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/one-hundred-things-restaurant-staffers-should-never-do-part-2/ Part 2]). A version of this for simple restaurants would be really useful, with advice about hygiene as well as attracting customers and improving the customers' experience.
