'''Salad burnet''' (''Sanguisorba minor'') or (''Poterium sanguisorba'') is a perennial herb that has an appearance similar to a fern. If care is not taken to keep this herb in check (it seeds freely), it can escape the herb garden and become weed-like in other areas of the garden.<ref name="illinois" /> The salad burnet plant is frost, cold and drought tolerant, and is often found growing well in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides.<ref name="utah" />

== Description ==
Salad burnet has leaves that are very fine, delicate, loose, and fern-like. The flowers are small and pink, purple-pink to reddish, with a roundish appearance.[[File:Burnetfloralhead.png|thumb|The flowers of salad burnet|right|250px]]

The plant grows to about 25 to 32.5cm tall.

Although the leaves are fairly bland in colour, in bright light they can appear tinged with pink.

== Growing salad burnet ==
Choose a location which has full sun.<ref name="illinois">http://extension.illinois.edu/herbs/salad-burnet.cfm</ref> It can tolerate light shade.<ref name="psu" /> It is fine with average garden soil.<ref name="illinois" /> The soil should be well drained.<ref name="utah">http://extension.usu.edu/rangeplants/htm/small-burnet/</ref> Either alkaline or slightly acidic soils will work for this plant.<ref name="utah" />

Choose between sowing seeds in the spring or dividing the plant in the autumn or fall. 

Salad burnet will tolerate dry soil once established.<ref name="illinois" />

Although the herb is perennial, it will benefit from being divided every three to four years, to encourage new growth and maintain its vigour.<ref name="illinois" />

== Harvesting ==
The leaves will last until winter, up until which time they can be picked and used as needed. However, only harvest the fresh new growth of leaves, as older leaves are tough and tend to be bitter.

To encourage more leafy growth, remove the flowers when they form.<ref name="illinois" /> This will also help you to keep the plant under control, as it can't seed unless the flowers are left in place.

== Uses of salad burnet ==
=== Culinary ===
Salad burnet has a mild flavour of cucumber. This matches well with vegetable dishes, especially with [[celery]] and [[asparagus]]. Use as a fresh herb for best results. It is high in vitamin C when used fresh.<ref name="utah" />

At the beginning of winter, the fresh leaves can be added to stews, casseroles, soups and sauces, to add a refreshing flavour.

Salad burnet can be added to vinegars,<ref name="psu">http://extension.psu.edu/plants/gardening/herbs/salad-burnet</ref> herb butters and cold drinks.<ref name="utah" />

=== Animal feed ===
The plant is useful for wildlife forage (big game, birds, and rabbits) and it is a good sheep forage, with high levels of protein and carotene.<ref name="utah" />

=== Restoration ===
Salad burnet has a role to play in erosion control after fires.<ref name="utah" /> It can be used to grow in place of invasive or noxious weeds when repairing land after a fire.<ref name="utah" />
