==Effective charging method for ultracapacitors==
Abstract:One of the advantages of ultracapacitors is its high power capability, which is applicable for high rate of charging
and discharging operation like motor starting and regenerative braking of an electric vehicle. This paper presents
a new charging method for ultracapacitors. Comparing with batteries, ultracapacitor can accept a wide range of
charging current and can be fully charged within a few minutes. Common chargers for ultracapacitors are usually
equipped with current transducers and closed loop circuitry for current control, which are expensive and complicated. The proposed circuit consists of a minimum number of components. It does not require any current transducer or dedicated voltage/current control circuitry. A simple open-loop control system is applicable for the whole
charging stage. It is free of stability problem and protects itself from being overloaded by ultracapacitor with zero
initial charge. This paper presents the design and operation of the hardware circuit. Both simulation and experimental results are included.
==Use of Super-Capacitor to Enhance Charging Performance of Stand-Alone Solar PV System==
Abstract:The battery charging performance in a stand-alone solar PV system 
affects the PV system efficiency and the load operating time. The New Energy 
Center of National Taiwan University has been devoted to the development of a 
PWM charging technique to continue charging the lead-acid battery after the 
overcharge point to increase the battery storage capacity by more than 10%. The 
present study intends to use the super-capacitor to further increase the charge capacity before the overcharge point of the battery. The super-capacitor is connected 
in parallel to the lead-acid battery. This will reduce the overall charging impedance during the charge and increase the charging current, especially in sunny 
weather. A system dynamics model of the lead-acid battery and super-capacitor 
was derived and the control system simulation was carried out to predict the 
charging performance for various weathers. It shows that the overall battery impedance decreases and charging power increases with increasing solar radiation. 
An outdoor comparative test for two identical PV systems with and without supercapacitor was carried out. The use of super-capacitor is shown to be able to increase the lead-acid charging capacity by more than 25% at sunny weather and 
10% in cloudy weather.
==Maximum power transfer tracking for a photovoltaic-supercapacitor energy system==
Abstract:It is important to maintain high efﬁciency when charging electrical
energy storage elements so as to achieve holistic optimization from
an energy generation source (e.g., a solar cell array) to an energy
storage element (e.g., a supercapacitor bank). Previous maximum
power point tracking (MPPT) methods do not consider the fact that
efﬁciency of the charger varies depending on the power output level
of the energy generation source and the state of charge of the storage
element. This paper is the ﬁrst paper to optimize the efﬁciency of
a supercapacitor charging process by utilizing the MPPT technique
and simultaneously considering the variable charger efﬁciency. More
precisely, previous MPPT methods only maximize the power output
of the energy generation source, but they do not guarantee the maximum energy is stored in the energy storage element. Note that the
load device takes its energy from the storage element so it is important to maximize energy transfer from the source into the storage
element. We present a rigorous framework to determine the optimal
capacitance of a supercapacitor and optimal conﬁguration of a solar
cell array so as to maximize the efﬁciency of energy transfer from
the solar cells into a bank of supercapacitors. Experimental results
show the efﬁcacy of the proposed technique and design optimization
framework.
==A novel charging control scheme for super capacitor energy storage in photovoltaic generation system==
Abstract:A control scheme is described to charge 
series-connected super capacitors for photovoltaic generation 
systems. Based on the features of the super capacitors charge, the 
control scheme consists of three modes, i.e., the constant current 
charge mode, the constant power charge mode, and the constant 
voltage charge mode. The shift of three modes can be realized by 
controlling the duty of IGBT in the Boost-Buck converter system. 
Meanwhile, the high voltage, which is more suitable for 
application, can be obtained. Compared with the normal charge 
method with series-connected current-limiting resistance and the 
charge method with the constant current charge mode and the 
constant voltage charge mode, the proposed charging control 
scheme can shorten the charging time and improve the usage of 
the electric power generated from the PV arrays. The advantage 
described above is verified by simulations. 
==Research on Supercapacitor Charging Efficiency of Photovoltaic System==
Abstract:the model of supercapacitor and its charging 
performance with constant voltage charging mode, constant 
current charging mode and constant power charging mode were 
studied. A numerical method to calculate the efficiency of these 
charging modes was inducted. To analyze the storage 
performance of supercapacitor in PV system, using this method, 
the maximum charging efficiencies of supercapacitor when its 
terminal voltage raise from zero to the rated voltage with 
different charging modes were presented. The multi-stage 
charging efficiency curves were retrieved, which indicated that 
the constant power charging mode is more suitable when 
supercapacitor are charged in PV system. A MPPT plus constant 
power control charging strategy using two-stage Buck-Boost 
converter to charge supercapacitor in PV system was proposed. 
The simulation results showed that this strategy effectively 
ensure the charging efficiency of the system. 
== Technology Research Of Novel Energy Storage Control For The PV Generation System==
Abstract:Recent years, technologies for new energy have developed rapidly since the energy crisis and the environmental pollution got worse. And the solar energy generation technology tends towards the stage of a large number of applications in engineering from the research stage. This paper designed a grid-connected PV system firstly, then introduced the operation principle of the various parts as well with the control strategy of the power flow. The design of energy storage is of great significance as the output power of PV cells array is greatly affected by the light intensity and the temperature change. Battery is used as the energy storage device normally in the traditional energy storage system. In this paper, it used the Ultracapacitor as the energy storage device after comparing with the battery, and designed the charge-discharge control strategy according to the characteristics of the ultracapacitor. Finally it verified the feasibility of the energy storage control strategy through the simulation models which was built based on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform.

==Control of Bidirectional DC-DC Converter for Supercapacitor Automotive Application==
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study a sliding-
mode controller to regulate the voltage and current
a bidirectional DC-DC converter . The converter
is placed between a supercapacitor array (SA) and
a DC-link �xed at 42V. Supercapacitor array is re-
garded as powered system with high current and
low voltage source. The DC-DC converter is bidi-
rectional: it is a Boost converter when the SA pro-
vides the power requirement of the DC link and a
Buck converter when SA is charged from the DC
link. The output voltage ( Boost case) and the
inductor current (Buck case) are regulated at con-
stant values using a sliding mode approach.

==MCU Controlled DC-DC Buck/Boost Converter for Supercapacitors==
Abstract: This work is focused on DC to DC conversion, what is a crucial function to enable the use of
supercapacitors for energy storage. A theoretical study and comparison of methods, algorithms
and techniques for software controlled DC-DC converters have been used to develop a system
what can step up or down a DC variable voltage and transform it into a steady state voltage.
As a result a new control theory based on Bang-Bang control has been developed with an
ARM LPC1768 processor. It was implemented to solve the commercial converters problems
because they cannot work with supercapacitors due to their low internal resistance.
The outcome is a device what can provide a programmable voltage between 4.5 V and 25 V,
hardware can support up to 6 A and it is able to control the operating current 
owing through
the converter. It can be used with the supercapacitors as shown in this work but it can also be
used as a general platform for voltage and energy conversion.
Furthermore, the designed hardware has the potential to work with smart grids via Ethernet
connector, solar panels with MPPT algorithms and, at last, manage energy between di�erent
kinds of DC voltage sources and devices.

==Isolated Bidirectional DC–DC Converter for SuperCapacitor Applications==
Abstract: This paper proposes a new bidirectional DC/DC
converter for supercapacitor applications. The proposed converter
has a parallel structure in supercapacitor side (where voltage is
low and current is high) and a series structure in the other side.
This structure increases efficiency of the converter. For current
sharing in the parallel side of the proposed converter, two
different methods are recommended and compared in this paper:
Current balancing transformer (CBT) and two separate inductors
(TSI). Simulation and experimental results show performance of
the proposed converter.

==MODELING BATTERY-ULTRACAPACITOR HYBRID SYSTEMS FOR SOLAR AND WIND APPLICATIONS==
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to quantify the improvement in the performance of a battery with
the addition of an ultracapacitor as an auxillary energy storage device for solar and wind applica-
tions. The improvement in performance was demonstrated through simulation and modeling. A
ceraolo battery model and a third order ultracapacitor ladder model were implemented in Mat-
lab/Simulink. Sample battery load cycles for solar and wind applications have been obtained
from literature and the corresponding C-rates were quanti�ed. The C-rate for the solar load
cycle was found to be 0.3C and 0.2C for the wind load cycle. The performance of the battery-
ultracapacitor system was checked for the sample solar and wind load cycles and compared with
the performance of the battery system without an ultracapacitor. A reduction of 50.5% in bat-
tery RMS currents was found for the solar load cycle and 60.9% for the wind load cycle. This
reduction in battery RMS currents was found to be directly proportional to the ultracapacitor
contribution. Given the low C-rates for the sample load cycles it was deduced that the addition
of an ultracapacitor will not signi�cantly improve the battery life to justify the high initial costs.

==Sizing Ultracapacitors For Hybrid Electric Vehicles==
Abstract: An efficient energy storage medium is essential in all
hybrid electric vehicles. The advances in double layer
electrolytic capacitor technology have opened new areas to
complement batteries as a storage medium. In this paper we will
review some of the present applications of ultracapacitors as
well as to provide guidelines for sizing ultracapacitors for
minimal mass in hybrid electric vehicles. Equations for both
constant current as well as constant power discharge are
discussed. An iterative method for determining the minimum
number of ultracapacitor cells is introduced. The effects of
ultracapacitor sizing on the rating of interface power electronics
are examined.

==ULTRACAPACITOR/ BATTERY HYBRID FOR SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE==
Abstract: All stand alone photovoltaic systems require an energy buffer to bridge the mismatch between available and required
energy. Battery technology, chiefly the lead acid battery, is the most popular form of energy storage utilized. Nevertheless
in a photovoltaic application, the storage battery generally has the highest life time cost in the system, it has a profound
effect on the systems reliability and global performance. Photovoltaic panels are not an ideal source for charging batteries as
the output is unreliable and heavily dependent on weather conditions an optimum charge/ discharge cycle cannot be
guaranteed. Using an ultracapacitor and battery hybrid system it is aimed to prolong the lifetime of the battery, making the
overall system more efficient and reliable. The ultracapacitor/ battery hybrid system will be controlled by an energy
management system (EMS) implemented in labview. The EMS will implement maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and
the chosen battery charging algorithm.

Abstract:A microsource interface with energy storage would help to
realise the plug and play functionality of a MicroGrid. This
paper discusses the energy storage interface. Selection and
sizing of the energy storage unit is explained. A bi-directional
converter is used to interface the storage, and a controller is
implemented to keep the output voltage of the converter
approximately constant. The energy storage unit was
connected to a PV system in simulation. The system response
to the irradiance, temperature and load variations were
analysed in this paper.

==TurboCap: A Batteryless, Supercapacitor-based Power Supply for Mini-FDPM==
Abstract: This paper describes TurboCap, a batteryless,
supercapacitor-based power supply subsystem for a handheld,
laser-based breast cancer detector named the Mini-FDPM. Supercapacitors
have high power density and are a better match
with the power usage pattern than batteries. However, the multivoltage
requirement poses a new problem on the selection of
supercapacitor topology for conversion efficiency and for formfactor
minimization. Experimental results show that our design
can efficiently power the Mini-FDPM system for energy-efficient,
untethered operation in a compact size while supporting fast
recharge.

==Energy Harvesting by Sweeping Voltage-Escalated Charging of a Reconfigurable Supercapacitor Array==
Abstract: EscaCap is an energy harvester that uses a boostup
charge pump to perform maximum power-transfer tracking
(MPTT) while charging a reservoir supercapacitor array
(RSA) with a reconfigurable topology. Unlike buck-down type
harvesters, the voltage-doubling charge pump of EscaCap enables
the sensor nodes to operate under low ambient power conditions.
The supercapacitors in the RSA can be dynamically configured
for series or parallel topologies by means of a switch array
for not only minimizing leakage of the supercapacitors but also
improving the charging speed. Furthermore, the RSA of EscaCap
is modular and can be easily expanded. Experimental results
show that EscaCap can harvest energy efficiently under low and
high solar irradiation conditions, achieve shorter charging time,
and demonstrate flexibility and robustness.

==Efficient Charging of Supercapacitors for Extended Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Nodes==
Abstract: This paper describes an efficient charging method
for a supercapacitor-operated, solar-powered wireless sensor
node called Everlast. Unlike traditional wireless sensors that store
energy in batteries, Everlast’s use of supercapacitors enables the
system to operate for an estimated lifetime of 20 years without any
maintenance. The novelty of this system lies in the feed-forward,
pulse frequency modulated converter and open-circuit solar
voltage method for maximum power point tracking (MPPT),
enabling the solar cell to efficiently charge the supercapacitor
and power the node. Experimental results show that by its
low-complexity MPPT, Everlast can achieve over 89% conversion
efficiency with lower power overhead than the state-of-the-art by
two orders of magnitude, while enabling charging a supercapacitor
up to 400% faster than direct charging. This makes Everlast
particularly applicable to miniature-scale, high-impedance energy
harvesting systems.

==A new simplified model of Double-Layer Capacitors ==
Abstract: The paper introduces a simplified model,
named “two branches model”, to characterize the electrical
behaviour of the DLCs (Double Layer Capacitors). The new
model is very similar to many others in literature from the
circuital point of view, however the process of identification
of its parameters is easier and faster. This new identification
process can be followed in other some model proposed in
literature. Experimental charge tests have been executed on
supercapacitors of two different labels (Epcos and Maxwell)
and size (between 100F to 600F). The experimental results
and the performed simulations have been reported in order
to verify the validity of the new identification proposed
method.

==Modeling and Simulation of Supercapacitors==
Abstract: In this paper we present some models for supercapacitors. The supercapacitors are used
more and more in high level industries such as: traction systems, automotive industry, aerospace
industry, telecommunications etc. Undestanding supercapacitors operation mode is necessary so we
can be able to determine the applications which require these components, and to be able to choose
between supercapacitors and other energy storage devices. In this paper were used some models for
the implementation of supercapacitors, and the simulations made in Orcad 9.2 to determine their
operation, are in time and frequency domain. Also, the models were implemented in Simulink 7.5 and
the simulation results prove the models accuracy. Two test measurements on the ECOND Pscap350
supercapacitor were realized and using the measurement data, two methods to compute the
parameters are presented.

in time domain. All theoretical results are compared
with the response of the physical system with the ultracapacitor.
Then the issue of capacity for the ultracapacitors is shown and
discussed.

which theoretically leads to a transmission line with
voltage dependant distributed capacitance.

==PSiM Based Electric Modeling of Supercapacitors for Line Voltage Regulation of Electric Train System==
Abstract: Supercapacitor can be used for energy storage
and peak power control in order to increase the efficiency
and the life cycle of the system. Recent developments in the
field of supercapacitors have led to the achievement of high
specific energy and high specific power devices. Due to the
capacitances of several hundred farads and serial
resistances of less than one milliohm, these new components
are suitable for energy storage in high power electronic
applications, especially in the field of management of
embarked electrical power (hybrid power sources, energy
recovery). This paper presents a method to identify the
equivalent circuit parameters of supercapacitor by the
experimental results. In order to validate this method,
parameters of a Maxwell BCAP 3000F are extracted from
the experiment and then the equivalent circuit model using
parameters is implemented by using the PSiM software.
Finally, experimental and simulation results are compared
to verify the electric modeling of some supercapacitors.
