:''For "mapping" in the sense of physical locations, see [[Location and sustainability]].''

The mapping of [[knowledge resources]] for and about [[sustainability]] - in the sense of providing a guide to available knowledge and [[data]] resources and their relationships to each other - is an important part of [[sustainability knowledge management]]. 

Appropedia does this using a [[wiki]] ([[MediaWiki]]) as the [[platform]]. The category structure provides an open source ontology (or knowledge map). [[:Category:Portals|Portals]] with their expandable category trees provide more focused maps. These may be enhanced if features such as category clouds or tag clouds are added.

Other efforts include [http://gssd.mit.edu/GSSD/GSSDen.nsf/frameLinks?OpenPage&BaseTarget=Right GSSD's "Mapping Sustainability"], from [[MIT]].
