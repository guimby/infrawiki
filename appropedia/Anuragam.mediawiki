==Background==
* The right to participate is on of the less understood and implemented rights of children. The children are an integral part of any family or society. They have a right to participate in the affairs of the family, village, District and state. If participation is encouraged there is every chance that children will grow up to be citizens who feel the responsibility to develop the community. To encourage this participation the children need assistance from the adults. The parents, teachers, and politicians are the significant adults who can enhance participation of the children. 

* Now that we know that children have rights we need to make the children/parents aware of these rights. One of these rights is the right to education. Every child has to be in school up to the age of 14. If the child is not in school then it is assumed that he/she is a child laborer. Though this is true many villagers/parents who never admit their children to school or have advised them to drop out of school may not agree that their children are child laborers. It is easier to establish the fact if the child is sent out to work for some one else for wages. But when the child is drawn to the family business it is much more difficult to convince the parents that their ward is a child laborer.
