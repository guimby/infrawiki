'''Insectary plants''' attract [[beneficial insects]], including predator insects and pollinators.

==Components==

Insectary plants can provide food, water, shelter or space eggs and larvae. These are provided in these forms: 
 
* Plant matter for direct forage
* Plant matter for pest insect forage, which in turn provides forage for beneficial insects (EG: a "trap crop" of [[dill]], which attracts [[aphids]], which in turn attract [[ladybugs]] and their voracious larvae)
* Plant or ground environments for new generations of beneficial insects
* Shallow water sources, frequently with pebbles to provide perches

==Commonly seen in==

* Biodynamics
* Wineries
* Organic agriculture & gardens
