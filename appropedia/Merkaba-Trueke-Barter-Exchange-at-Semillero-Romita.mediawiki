==Intro==
Merkaba Trueke is a group that gets together to exchange resources, knowledge, and services through barter.  Rather then using money, people must exchange goods and services and this exchange is based on trust, solidarity, cooperation, reciprocity and mutual assistance rather then hierarchical market values.  In this way people within the Merkaba Trueke not only value the items and services they value other people within the group.  This is barter exchange is part of a group called [[Semillero Romita]].  

===Meeting Time===
The group meets every last Sunday of the month in Plaza Romita, [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]].

==How does the Barter Exchange Work==
===Using barter or Romitas===
Each member brings their products and a list of knowledge and services that they offer or they can bring Romitas.  Romitas are like a ticket that can be used at the exchange if you do not have something to trade.  Each person sets Romita cost of their products. No cash is allowed. Romitas are much different from Money. 

===Difference between Romitas and Money===

==Who can Participate==
*New members are asked to attend a short introduction the morning of the market so that they can learn about the process, “rules”, and meet other members before trading. 

*People do not have to have fresh garden veggies or fruits in order to trade.  Other items and services for trading include: cooking, knitting, bookbinding, crafts, lessons in some skill, or anything else you can think of that would be attractive to other members. 

*The market tries to promote the value of handmade items, thus if someone want to sell second hand items they can, however it is generally not valued at the equivalent cost of those handmade items.



===How do you know the supply and demand of other members?===
The group has a directory of supply and demand with data from it’s members.  When joining the group you receive a directory and it is updated each time a new member joins.
