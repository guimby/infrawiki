=Video Production=

This project will need a dedicated video production worker or team familiar with digital video publishing. We intend to rely on YouTube and/or Vimeo as the chief distribution venue for the series with episodes between 45-90 minutes each. Our approach to the fabrication of the project will determine the degree of indoor and outdoor production work, but we also anticipate the use of many location shoots and personal interviews in places around the world. We are not concerned about a very high production value--in fact, that would somewhat work against our project's intended aesthetic. Production style should reinforce the impression of a DIY project even for the video production itself while being well made and professional.
