This article compares the pumptypes to allow the selection of the best type of pump for any given situation. Note that the maximum lift height also determines the applications it can be used for. Low lift pumps are only suitable for the pumping of surface water (e.g. irrigation, drainage of lands, ...), while high lift heights allow deep water pumping (eg potable water pumping from wells).<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E05.htm Table of pumps; classification and charisteristics]</ref>
