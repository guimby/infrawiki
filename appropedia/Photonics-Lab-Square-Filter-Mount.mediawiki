==Project==

This is a two part square (50.8 mm^2) filter stand for the photonics lab at Michigan Tech. The square filter is placed into the slots on the top half of the mount which is then placed into the bottom half and held in place with a set screw. The hole for a 1/4" set screw; an appropriate nut is press fit into the designed hole on the base. The lab has requested for a spot to place labels on the stand so a standard size label black was added to the top mount.

==Prototype==

The print is made up of two parts, the base and the filter mount. The base is to be printed right-side-up along with the filter mount. The filter mount needs support (printed at 20%) to be able to print it right-side-up. The slot is meant to hold a 2.8mm thick filter within a 3mm channel, the printer must be able to meet the required resolution. The set screw may need to be epoxied if the press fit is not sufficient. The channel for the filter must also be smother and have no burs. The commercial equivalent of this product is $100.
