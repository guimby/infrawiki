===Volunteering for development work===

Note: There are sites and organizations which ask you to pay to volunteer. This may or may not be a good way of supporting a good cause. It's normal that you pay your own airfare, and perhaps pay a reasonable amount for food and accommodation, but some Western agencies charge volunteers well above the usual local rates in third world countries. It may be wiser to deal with non-profit groups or arrange things yourself (taking proper precautions, of course).{{fact}}{{expand}} Be aware of the realities of "[[voluntourism]]."

It's also important to recognize your limitations - on your first trip to a developing world context, the most valuable things you can do are to listen and learn. Consider a [[Cultural exchange in international development|cultural exchange]] program.
