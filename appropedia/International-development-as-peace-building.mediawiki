If we have a world where all people have opportunities and freedom from [[poverty]], there is less motivation for conflict.

== Many kinds of connection ==

Many mutually beneficial relationships can be built - and each of them is an incentive for ongoing relationships between the parties of the relationship. For example:
* [[Trade]] - which may be increased through [[free trade]] or by more specific arrangements
* [[Foreign worker]] programs
* [[Cultural]] relationships, including [[cultural exchange]] programs and television programs from the other country. These build friendships and [[empathy]].
* [[Aid]] and [[international development]] programs - although even these can build suspicion (see [[Honesty as policy in aid and development #Community suspicion and acceptance]]).
