[http://www.biomimicryinstitute.org The Biomimicry Institute] is a not-for-profit organization that promotes the study and imitation of natureâ€™s remarkably efficient designs, bringing together scientists, engineers, architects and innovators who can use those models to create [[sustainable technologies]]. '''The Biomimicry Institute''' offers short-term workshops and two-year certificate courses in [[biomimicry]] for professionals, and helps to develop and share biomimicry-related curricula used in a range of educational venues, from K-12 classrooms to universities, as well as in non-formal settings such as zoos and museums. The Biomimicry Institute does not conduct its own research; rather, it serves as a clearinghouse and resource for those who do.

    * Developing educational programs for students, professionals and the general public.
    * Working to create public policies that use biomimicry as a solution to sustainability challenges.
    * Encouraging companies that are profiting from biomimicry to provide financial support for [[biodiversity]].
