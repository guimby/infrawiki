The '''Hippo Water Roller''' was specifically designed to alleviate the suffering caused by a lack of access to [[water]].  The Hippo Water Roller is a barrel-shaped container designed to transport 90 liters (20 gallons) of water.  It comprises of a drum with a large screw-on cap and a clip-on steel handle.

The drum is manufactured from UV stabilized Polyethylene and has been designed to withstand typical rural conditions such as uneven footpaths, rocks and even broken bottles.  The large opening (135 mm / 5.3 inch diameter) allows for easy filling and cleaning of the interior.  The sealed lid ensures hygienic storage of water and the steel handle provides firm control over difficult terrain while pushing or pulling the roller.  

The innovative design allows water to be placed inside the "wheel" rather than carried above the wheel.  The 90kg (200 pound) weight of water is borne on the ground resulting in an effective weight of just 10kg (22 pounds) on level ground. Children and the elderly can easily manage a full roller over most types of terrain.
