==Assembly - Summary==
# Prepare and attach motor mounts
# Attach X-axis

==Assembly - Step-by-Step==
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_15.jpg|thumb|right|.]][[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_14.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Attach the guide rod clamp to one of the motor mounts.  Don't tighten the screws yet.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_13.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Make sure the nuts are inside the recesses.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_12.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Next, attach the motors to the mounts.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_11.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Make sure the wires are on the proper side.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_0.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Next step is to assemble the lead screws.  The washers in the picture shouldn't be used.  The bottom nuts are in the picture, but aren't used yet.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_1.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Assemble the top part of the screw.  Add the top screws as well, but don't tighten them (not shown in the picture).{{clear}}
#Screw them into the X-axis and screw the bottom nut on.
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_4a.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Set the top nuts of the lead screws to approximately halfway of the lead screw, then push the X axis into the spring to thread the bottom nuts up.  Thread them so far, that when letting the X axis rest on them, the top screws are flush with the plastic.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_1a.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Put the X axis with those rods on the base of the printer.{{clear}}
#Attach the motor mount with the guide rod clamp to the right side of the top rods.  Make sure the rods don't stick out.
#Attach the other motor mount to the left side of the top rods.  The rods will stick out considerably.
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_3.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Put the smooth rod from the top through the motor mount block.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_5.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Then through the X-axis.  {{clear}}
#Then through the lead screw support.  Note that there are some [[RepRap_lead_screw_support_issues:MOST|issues]] with this, so you may want to skip this.  It is also not on the pictures for this reason.
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_4.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Finally, put a clamp at the bottom of the bar with nuts and washers.  Push the smooth rod through it.  Don't tighten anything.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_3a.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Attach the other smooth rod in the same way.  Note that it doesn't have the top clamp.{{clear}}
#Slide the extruder onto the top rods, so that it clamps the smooth rod.
#Put the tube through the top rods.
#Click the X carriage onto the X axis bearings.  You will need considerable force for this; be sure to support the bearings from underneath.
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_alignment_5.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Connect the lead screws to the motors.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_alignment_0.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Next we will align the frame.  We use gravity, which is exactly vertical.  This means we want the base of the frame to be perfectly horizontal.  Position the frame in a way that allows easy access to both sides, then using paper under the footed verices (the parts that touch the table), make sure the y axis is horizontal.  Check this with a spirit level.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_alignment_1.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Put a piece of flat material on the Y-axis smooth rods and check the x axis to be horizontal with the spirit level.  Add paper to the feet as needed.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_alignment_3.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Hang a nut on a string to make a vertical line.{{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_alignment_4.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Adjust the bar clamps on the bottom (in both horizontal directions) to make sure the smooth rods are completely vertical.  {{clear}}
#[[Image:MOST_HSPrusa_z-axis_6a.jpg|thumb|right|.]]Attach the z-axis limit switch to its holder and then place the assembled end stop on the guide rod under the x-axis motor end. Insert an M3 nut and an M3 x 20mm screw into the end stop holder and tighten just enough to keep the holder in place on the guide rod.  Don't worry about its height yet.{{clear}}
