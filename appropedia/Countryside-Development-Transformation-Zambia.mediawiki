Countryside Development Transformation Zambia (CDTZ)  is a newly formed organisation with the mission of transforming undeveloped rural areas in Zambia.  Our areas of concern include promotion of [[appropriate technology]], health and education promotion.

(In order to reduce costs, CDTZ does not maintain their own website at this time.  For now, they use Appropedia to post their web information as needed.)
