==Introduction==
[[image:Reprap.png|thumb|RepRap]]

[http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page Reprap] is an [[Open source 3-D printer|open-source 3-D printer]], under development with the goal of being able to print all the components which are used to build it. 
* useful for enabling local technological development
* self-replicating
* open-source, community project
* developed on its [http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page wiki] and through its mailing list
* Mendel is RepRap v.2; Darwin was v.1
* In most cases it is environmentally beneficial to locally manufacture plastic products with a RepRap than to manufacture and ship them conventionally. See : [[Environmental impacts of distributed manufacturing from 3-D printing of polymer components and products]]

'''Reprap.org is a community project''', which means you are welcome to edit most pages on their site [http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapWiki:Community_portal community portal] and [http://reprap.org/wiki/Development New Development] pages have more information on how to get involved.

The RepRap is becoming more self replicating every day. New projects may be of interest for nearly completely 3D printable versions:
