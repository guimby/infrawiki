|1 |Trace 8 diamonds on an aluminum sheet made up of two equilateral triangles with dimensions of 1 foot. Add tabs a 3/4 of an inch wide on all four sides (this will be used for attaching the triangles to each other).

|2 |Use available resources to bend tabs on the aluminum diamond. One way is to screw together two pieces of wood and place the tab in between them (this is our suggestion but there are other ways to bend the aluminum).

|3 |With the assist of a square metal tube of no larger of 3/4 of an inch wide, fold two of the diamonds in half to approximately 90 degrees and use sheet metal screws to fasten the diamonds with one folded corner to each other on to the metal tube. Create a X shape with diameter of 2 feet.
