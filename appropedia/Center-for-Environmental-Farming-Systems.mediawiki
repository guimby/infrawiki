==Mission==
[http://www.cefs.ncsu.edu/index.htm The Center for Environmental Farming Systems] develops and promotes food and farming systems that protect the environment, strengthen local communities, and provide economic opportunities in North Carolina and beyond.

==History==
The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) was established in 1994 by North Carolina State University, North Carolina A&T State University, and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to serve as a center dedicated to sustainable agriculture research, extension, and education. CEFS was the result of several years of work by a task force of university faculty and administrators, state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, farmers, and citizens charged with developing a strategy to build a strong sustainable agriculture program in North Carolina. Located at the Cherry Research Farm near Goldsboro, CEFS began its sustainable agriculture programming in 1996. Today, CEFS is one of the nationâ€™s largest centers for the study of environmentally sustainable farming practices.
