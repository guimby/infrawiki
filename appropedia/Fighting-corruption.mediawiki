'''Fighting corruption''' requires recognizing that [[corruption]] damages [[society]] and the [[economy]], and taking the appropriate steps:
* Pay civil servants enough that corrupt practices are not necessary and not excusable.
* Crackdown on the ringleaders and punish to the full extent of the law.
* Provide an amnesty for regular members of the civil service who were enmeshed in standard corrupt practices.
* Educate, so that corruption is understood to be unacceptable.
* Carry out [[institutional strengthening]] and create new institutions such as an [[ombudsman]], as appropriate.
* Protect whistleblowers
