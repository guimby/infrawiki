Cargo bike centre in Budapest promotes sustainable transport solutions and environmentally-conscious business models, June 1 <ref>[http://blog.acceleratingtransitions.eu/?p=2373 Accelerating Transitions Blog]</ref>

:Last month the do-it-yourself non-profit bicycle cooperative Cyclonomia teamed up with an organic vegetable farm called Zsámboki Biokert and Kantaa a mainly cargobike-focused bike messenger enterprise to cooperate in work and build communities upon the ideas they believe in. Cargonomia is aimed not to be only a fruitful business co-op but also an example to promote environmentally conscious transport and food production solutions to citizens and businesses.

:The model leans on the distribution of bio food grown in farms near Budapest to costumers in the city on cargo bikes which are maintained and built by the Cyclonomia community.

:Cargonomia also plans to be a logistics centre for sustainable urban transport solutions where community members can borrow, rent and buy locally manufactured cargo bikes.

:As a community centre they are planning numerous activities such as cultural events, workshops, discussions on DiY culture, sustainable transitions and the idea of degrowth.

:The centre which was opened in May was acquired through the ‘Lakatlan’ project of KÉK (Contemporary Architecture Centre) which aims to revitalise empty buildings, shops and properties in Budapest with community activities and businesses.

:Cargonomia finds it important to promote concrete alternatives to standard profit-driven social and economic systems.
