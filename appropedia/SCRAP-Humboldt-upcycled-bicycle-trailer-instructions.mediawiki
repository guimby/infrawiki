==Building the Bicycle Trailer==
These are the steps that our team The Trailer Park Boys used to construct our bicycle trailer. The components below include a wheel chair, a conduit frame, a road sign tub, a cover, the tongue, and hitch. Instructions are listed below for each component.

==Preparing the Wheelchair==
The wheelchair is an essential item in our design. 
*Disassemble wheelchair into individual parts.
*Determine which parts of the wheelchair frame will remain.
*Remove excess material from wheel chair frame. 
*Grind and file cuts 
*The wheelchair frame will be the starting point from which the rest of the frame will be constructed.

==The Frame==
The primary material of the frame was galvanized 3/4" conduit. Small sections of standard water pipe where used as well.
*After acquiring conduit, sketch a rough layout for the frame
*Using a conduit bender, bend the conduit appropriately based out your layout. (Note practicing with the conduit bend beforehand is good idea)
*Cut the water pipe into eight four inch sections, these will be used to attach the conduit to the wheelchair frame. 
*Braze or weld the water pipe to the wheelchair. 
*Cut eight six inch section of conduit and cut parallel half circles in the end, these will separate the two horizontal loops of the frame
*Tack weld the frame together and check for general fit before permanently welding the frame together.

==Street Sign Tub==
The tub was constructed entirely out of two aluminum street signs. 
*Measure dimensions of your frame to sketch dimensions of your tub.
*Use a jig saw to cut the signs to your dimensions.
*Two sections of angle iron clamped to a table can be used as a solid base to make the appropriate bends in the sign.
*Use a large round object if rounded bends need to be made.
*Using extra sections of your sign for backing strips, pop rivet the tub together. (It helps to place the tub in the frame before riveting)

==Cover Installation==
We used Kokotat material supplied by SCRAP Humboldt for it's great defense from the elements 
*Take measurements of the tub dimensions for a rough cut. Add additional length to drop down the sides for snaps and for vertical slack (in case payloads are taller than sidewalls).
*Once the cover is rough cut, lay atop the tub to fold, cut and trim as needed for a more finished fitting.
*Acquire snaps and separate female and male parts.
*Drill holes through the tub and pop rivet the male snaps in place.  
*Use a proper punch to secure female snaps to Kokotat.

=Tongue Instillation=
We used conduit to construct the trailers tongue as well for maximum stability.
*The first bend you want to make is a 90 degree bend that lies parallel with the front of the trailer
*Next the pipe will need to be bent so that it has a lift from the ground, rotate and make another bend so that the desired section of the pipe is ten inches off of the ground
*The tongue needs to be attached to the frame. Our solutions was to mold some of the excess road sign into a shell that fit around both the frame and the tongue and bolt road sign shell and tongue together.

=Hitch Construction=
The primary components of the hitch are an aluminum slug, heim joint, angle iron, and hitch pin. 
*The aluminum slug was fitting to the inside of the open end of the tongue. 
*The aluminum slug was then drilled and tapped appropriately for the already acquired heim joint. 
*Next the slug was fastened to the conduit via machine screws.
*A nut with a lock washer was threaded onto the heim joint prior to threading heim joint into the slug. This allows the heim joint to be fixed in a horizontally position
*The receiving end of the hitch is simply a small section of 1/4" angle iron that has be shaped and drilled to fit the rear axle diameter and the hitch pin.
