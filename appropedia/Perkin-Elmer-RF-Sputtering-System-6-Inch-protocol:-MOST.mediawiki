==Background on RF Sputtering System==

Physical sputtering is driven by momentum exchange between the ions and atoms in the materials, due to collisions.The incident ions set off collision cascades in the target. When such cascades recoil and reach the target surface with an energy greater the surface binding energy, an atom would be ejected, known as sputtering. If the target is thin on an atomic scale the collision cascade can reach the back side of the target and atoms can escape the surface binding energy `in transmission'. The average number of atoms ejected from the target per incident ion is called the sputter yield and depends on the ion incident angle, the energy of the ion, the masses of the ion and target atoms, and the surface binding energy of atoms in the target. For a crystalline target the orientation of the crystal axes with respect to the target surface is relevant.The primary particles for the sputtering process can be supplied in a number of ways, for example by a plasma, an ion source, an accelerator or by a radioactive material emitting alpha particles.[https://sites.google.com/site/semiconductorequipmentsource/sputter-deposition-system].More information on the basics of sputtering can be found at;

The Sputtering System used is in our lab for deposition of metals and ITO films is a 6" Perkin Elmer Model 2400. This is the oldest model of all the sputtering equipment in our labs current. However, it is still capable of high quality uniform films as confirmed by AFM characterization. The tool is available in M&M Room 432 at MTU's Multi-Scale Facility. [http://www.me.mtu.edu/Institutes/MuSTI/index.htm]

To use this tool, prior training leading to qualification is a prerequisite.

===Clean the Sample and Target===

Before the actual sputter deposition one of the following 2 steps to either clean the Sample or clean the Target is usually done.

====Pre-Etching (Clean Samples 5 min.)====

Samples should be cleaned for 5 min to remove any organics that may have built up on its surface. There are four targets plates installed in the sputter system. Three     of them have a metal target attached to them. The forth plate does not have a metal target attached to it. The blank forth plate is selected to be face over the table  holder with the samples. Plasma is generated between these two plates to clean the samples in the sputter etch process. Note: The Pre-Etch process requires an argon gas  flow of 30 SCCM.

6.	'''Pre-Etching Settings'''

*6.1 Adjust the argon gas flow to 30 SCCM.
*6.2 Adjust the knobs on the sputter deposition front panel to the following (See fig 6):

      Set Load = 5.00
      Tune = 3.05
      Mode = Sputter Etch
      Target selector = Etch
      Table position = Etch

*6.3 Press the white button on the panel to turn the RF power On.
*6.4 Slowly increase the RF power by rotating the Power Adjust button clockwise and  check to see if the plasma is On before stopping at a FORWARD POWER of 50 watts.

If the plasma is on, the TARGET BIAS will be greater than zero and there will be a purple light inside the chamber.

*6.5 Adjust the Load and Tune values to reduce the REFLECTED POWER and keep it below 10 Watts. Do not allow the FORWARD POWER increase beyond 100 watts. ( The scale on the meter is x 10)
*6.6 Increase the RF power further up to 100 watts and check to see if the plasma has turned on. If there is no plasma, press the ignition button.
*6.7 Adjust the Load and Tune values to minimize the reflected power and increase the forward power to a desired level. (usually 100 watts) Retune as needed.
*6.8 Set and start the timer for the 5 min Pre-Etch.
*6.9 Reduce the RF power (Power Adjust knob) to zero when the timer runs out.

====Pre-Sputter(Clean Target)====

Targets should be cleaned for 5 min before sputtering to remove any oxides and impurities that may have accumulated on them. The Au target is not to be cleaned.

For the pre-sputtering process, plasma is generated on one side of the chamber to clean the Target while the samples are held on the opposite side of the chamber.
Each Target in the chamber has a number associated with it. The number is written on the white board for reference and indicates the Target’s position in the chamber. Set the Target´s Selector accordingly to the desired Target to be cleaned. Always set the TABLE position to be furthest away (180 degrees) from the Target being used.
Each target has a starting LOAD and TUNE value, written on the white board,  that will be used in the pre-sputter sequence.	

7.	'''Pre-Sputter Settings'''

87.1 Adjust the knobs on the sputter deposition front panel to the following:

      Set Load = Value written on white board next to Target being used
      Tune = Value written on white board next to Target being used
      Mode = Sputter Deposit
      Target selector = Set to the Target you want to clean
      Table position = Set Table opposite Target being used

===Initiate Plasma====
*7.2 Press the white button on the panel to turn RF power on.
*7.3 Slowly increase the RF Power by rotating the Power Adjust button clockwise and check to see if the plasma is on before stopping at a FORWARD POWER of 50 watts.

If the plasma is on, the TARGET BIAS will be greater than zero and there will be a purple light inside the chamber.

*7.4 Adjust the Load and Tune values to reduce the REFLECTED POWER and keep it below 10 watts. Do not allow the FORWARD POWER to increase beyond 100 watts. 
(The scale on the meter is x 10)
*7.5 Increase the RF power further up to 100 watts and check to see if the plasma has turned on. If there is no plasma, press the ignition button.
*7.6 Adjust the Load and Tune values to minimize the reflected power and increase the forward power to a desired level. (usually 100 watts) Retune as needed.
*7.7 Set and start the timer for the 5 min Pre-Sputter.
*7.8 When there is 5 sec left on the timer slowly reduce the Power Adjust knob to achieve a FORWARD POWER of 25 watts.
				
===RF Sputter Deposition (Immediately following Pre-sputtering)===

8.	'''Deposit on samples'''
*8.1 Set the timer to the desired deposition time 
*8.2 Turn and set the TABLE POSITION knob to move your samples under the desired TARGET. Look through the chamber window to see exactly when the Table has moved under the target. 
*8.3 Slowly increase the POWER ADJUST knob to achieve a forward power of 100 watts. If the reflected power is not zero, minimize it by adjusting the Load and Tune.
*8.4 Start the timer.
*8.5 Midway through the deposition sequence make note of the high pressure gauge chamber pressure and fill this information into the logbook.
*8.6 When there is 5 sec left on the timer slowly reduce the Power Adjust knob until it reaches 0.
*8.7 Set the TABLE POSITION to the ETCH POSITION.
