'''Gaia University''' is an international learning community collaborating for eco-social regeneration. This is a permaculture university that credits your work in the world.

Gaia University offers a unique approach to higher learning by offering students (called "Associates") access to Bachelors and Masters degrees and Graduate Diplomas whilst the Associate is actively engaged in self and planetary transformation. Linking your ideals with self-directed practical experience, you act as a world changer, by working for local and global sustainability and regeneration, justice and peace. 
Our self-directed action learning methodology enables you to study locally, at work or on project, in your own language, supported by Gaia University's Regional Organizers, and a worldwide network of learning providers, tutors and mentors. 
No longer do you have to choose between earning a living and studying. With action learning your work and your projects become your places of study.
