==Abstract==
# The use of 3D printing in developing countries to replace broken or warn parts is greatly beneficial.  The low cost printing can be difference between having a mode of transportation or walking.  By printing bicycle parts the need to buy new parts will be eliminated.  I have printed a bicycle hub using PLA as a prototype for a simple road bike hub.  This model uses loose ball bearings which are not as ideal as sealed cartridge bearings when used with PLA.  For future designs a sealed cartridge bearing should be used.  The hub profile was modeled in FreeCad, rotated around the axle, then sliced with slicer and printed on a MOST-Delta Printer.

== Bill of Materials==
# Hub Axle- $1.25
# Hub Nut x2 $0.10
# Bearing Set x2 $.25
# PLA $1.50

## Upload and link to all STLs

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Drill bit for reaming spoke holes
# Open ended wrench
# Grease

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
# 3D printing
# Bicycle Maintence
# Bicycle Wheel Building

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

How To:
# Print hub halves (approx. 1 hr per half at 70% infill)
# Load greased ball bearings into bearing assembly
# Secure Bearing Top
# Thread Axle
# Secure Lock nuts
# Lace Wheel with correct spokes

* Assembly about 30 mins plus wheel construction time
* Total time around 2 hours



=== Common Problems and Solutions===

# Be sure to use grease on bearings and axle shaft to minimize early wear
# Use grease to hold bearings in bearing cup

== Cost savings==

# Estimate: $4.50 (with new parts) $1.50 with used parts
# Commercial Equivalent $10.00
# Savings of $5.50 or 55%
