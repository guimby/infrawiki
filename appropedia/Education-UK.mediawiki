=== Funding ===

{{#widget:YouTube|id=0TQFaanJ2as}}

[http://www.solarschools.org.uk/ Solar Schools], Project now closed according to website, Sep 2016. Community fund raising scheme for renewable energy projects. Each school has its own webpage where parents, ex-pupils, local businesses, and other supporters can buy squares of a ‘virtual’ solar roof. Once they have raised the total cost of the solar roof, they can erect it. The idea is that the solar roofs will help the schools reduce their carbon footprint, turn a profit from the renewable energy it sells and provide the children with a platform for learning about clean energy. {{W|10:10#.22Solar_Schools.22}}
