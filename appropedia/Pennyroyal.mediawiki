== Growing pennyroyal ==

Grow pennyroyal in the herb garden or as a border plant. It can also be grown as groundcover as it tolerates poor soil.<ref name="O">http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/node/695/print</ref> It can become invasive quite quickly, in the manner typical of members of the mint family. Planting in containers or surrounded by polyethylene bags can curb its spread.<ref name="psu" /><ref name="O" /> If planting more than one, plant 25cm or 12 inches apart.

Plant in partial shade to full sun.<ref name="psu" /> Pennyroyal prefers well-drained, rich soil that retains moisture.
