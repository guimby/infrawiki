==Problem being addressed==
Many mosquitos in tropical and subtropical regions carry protists that cause malaria in humans.  The mosquitos are abundant in these regions because of the optimal climate. Hence, there is a need to control mosquitosâ€™ habitat to prevent malaria spread.
==Detailed description of the solution==
Since mosquitos are attracted to light sources as well as CO2, they are drawn in to the CO2-baited CDC light traps.  Reducing the number of mosquitos near houses and villages will help prevent bites that could cause malaria. 
==Designed by==
*Designed by: W. Daniel Sudia and Roy Chamberlain in 1960 

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
Tested in Kenya (Mwea division in Kirinyaga District), Republic of Korea (Paju County, Kyonggi Province), and Taiwan
