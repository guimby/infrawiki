The centre of Southampton is located above a large hot water aquifer that can provide Geothermal power to some of the city's buildings. This energy is processed at a plant in the centre of the West Quay region in Southampton city centre and is the only geothermal power station in the UK. The plant provides private electricity for the Port of Southampton and hot water to a city centre district heating scheme. In a 2006 survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest carbon emitting cities in the [[United Kingdom]]. <ref>[[wikipedia:Southampton#Energy]]</ref>
