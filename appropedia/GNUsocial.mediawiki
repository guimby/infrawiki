GNUsocial is a social interaction platform on the Internet.
It is similar to the commercial service Twitter but is uncommercial and based on the open-source-thinking.
GNUsocial is also based on the thinking that ethics and solidarity are values of great importance and that these are not represented 
well by centralized commercial services in the world wide web.

On the english start page of GNUsocial you can find the following words (looked up on November 26th, 2016):
''"We are a federation of microbloggers who care about social justice and solidarity and want to quit the centralised capitalist services."''
