'''Neocolonialism''' was referred to by Sukarno{{w|Sukarno}} as part of ''Nekolim'', short for "neo-colonial imperialists." This was an example of his rhetoric against the established world powers which he saw as carrying on colonialism through other means. 

However this rhetoric (whether accurate or not) and the Non-Aligned Movement{{w|Non-Aligned Movement}} which he supported as part of this way of thinking, has not been seen in history as effective in the struggle against [[poverty]] and for the (self-determination? freedom? prosperity?) of the [[majority world]].
