Started in 2004 by MIT Researcher Bradley Martin-Anderson, GraphServer is an Open Source multi-modal public transport trip router, written in Python.

One of the uses of GraphServer was providing the back-end computations as part of the Transit Time Maps visual application on the Walk Score website. 

Much of the core capability of Graphserver was also ported into the [[OpenTripPlanner]] tool.
