'''Deforestation''' is the removal of [[trees]] and the surrounding [[ecosystems]] which make up [[forests]].

Deforestation is a particular problem in tropical [[forests]], which are disappearing rapidly due to human influence. The forest landscape is cleared for [[farms]] and pastures, for the harvesting of [[timber]] for [[construction]] and [[fuel]], and for [[roads]], [[housing]] and commercial use. 

Deforestation has profound and often devastating consequences - most obviously on loss of [[biodiversity]], loss of [[carbon sinks]], increasing [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere, interruption of water cycles and destroying [[water quality]], 
It may also cause social conflict, loss of livelihoods, and loss of food sources from forests and [[rivers]].

NASA conducts research on tropical forests using space-based and ground-based observations.
