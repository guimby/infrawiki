== Definition ==
'''Direct gain''' is a type of [[passive solar]] heating system that uses direct solar radiation to heat a building.  Buildings using a direct gain system use large, south-facing windows to admit sunlight. However using a direct gain system requires that a structure uses [[thermal storage]] material to absorb the [[radiation]] or inside temperatures will rise to more than 90deg F.
