==Objectives==
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will understand:
# Where our water come from
# Where our water goes after we have used it
# The sustainable paradigms and technologies we can employ while the water cycle is in our hands
# The careers involved in water management and sustainable use

==Goals==

The following are some of the main goals for the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module.
===Concepts===
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will understand the following concepts (among others):
* Global Water Cycle
* Personal and global human use
* Watershed Management
* Water Treatment (municipal and home)
* Waste Water Treatment  (municipal and home): Conventional, Marsh, Digesters, Solids Management
* Storm Water Management Systems and Design
* Sustainable Use Technologies: Greywater Systems, Rainwater Catchment, Municipal Water Reuse, Residential Technologies

===Vocabulary and units===
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will be able to confidently use the following vocabulary and/or units (among others):
* liters, gallons, GPM, CFS, mg/l, acre-foot, liters/flush
* hydrograph, watershed, flocculation, hyporheic zone, interception, through-fall, flow, pressure, friction, BOD, Stormwater, TSS, fecal coliform, low flush, aerator

===Calculations===
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will be able to do the following calculations (among others):
* Flow
* Water Cycle, Respiration and Photosynthesis 
* N Scale
* C Scale
* Hydrostatic Pressure
* Rainwater Catchment Calculations 

===How to===
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will be comfortable doing the following (among others):
* Read a hydrograph
* Measure flowrate
* Design a simple Rainwater Catchment system
* Design a simple Greywater system
* Determine hydrostatic pressure
* Convert between flow (cfs-gpm)
* Asses a region for most appropriate: Wastewater treatment systems, Stormwater management, Water storage

==Field trips==
By the end of the {{SUBPAGENAME}} module, students will be have gone on the following field trips (possibly among others):
* Pump station (e.g. West End Road)
* [[Arcata marsh]]
* Stormwater (e.g. Janes Creek Meadows)
* Residential greywater installation (e.g. [[AEF greywater]])
* Residential rainwater catchment system (e.g. [[M Street Eureka rainwater catchment]])
