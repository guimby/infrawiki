Decrease in [[China]]’s coal use sees global emissions fall in 2015, December 7 <ref>[http://www.carbonbrief.org/decrease-in-chinas-coal-use-sees-global-emissions-fall-in-2015 carbonbrief.org]</ref> The rapid growth in global carbon dioxide emissions over the last decade appears to have stalled, a new study says. Early estimates suggest that global emissions will decrease by 0.6% this year, following a small increase of 0.6% in 2014.

:The break in the emissions trend is mainly down to a drop in coal use in China, the study says, which drives a projected decrease in Chinese emissions of around 4% compared to 2014.

:However, this is unlikely to signal a peak in global emissions just yet, the researchers say.
