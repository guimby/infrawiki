'''[[Corruption]] mitigation''' includes very simple measures such as:
* sending beneficiaries a letter in their own language:
** tell them about the benefits they are supposed to receive (including the amount of any money) programs which will affect them, and selection processes.
** inform them that they don't need to pay any money or any fee to get selected as beneficiaries.
** even if they can't read, they can generally read numbers, and can often find a literate person if they have any doubts.
* putting in place “[[whistleblower]]” programs 
* strengthening internal audit functions. 
* putting things in writing. 
* using an independent translator. 
* using independent panels for making decisions, such as selecting villages. 
* using a money dealer rather than having staff deal with money.
