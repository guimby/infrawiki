'''Allspice''' (''Pimenta dioica'', ''Pimenta officinalis'') is also known as Jamaica pepper and myrtle pepper. It's a commonly used kitchen spice. Contrary to its name, it is not a mixture of different spices but is a single spice in its own right. The name was given to reflect the fact that it has overtones of nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper and cloves all in the one spice. It has an intense aroma and a delicate, bittersweet flavour. To some, the flavour is reminiscent of a combination of nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves but it is a spice all in its own right.

The allspice tree is an evergreen. It has large, glossy leaves around 12.5cm/12 inches in length. The fruit first appears after three years. After flowering, small berries appear; they begin green and ripen to a brown colour, which is the allspice. They have an appearance similar to that of a large peppercorn and are of a dark-grey brown colour, with a rough skin.

== Origins ==
Allspice is a native to the West Indies/Caribbean and Central America. It was grown mainly in Jamaica, hence its other common name, "Jamaica pepper". It is now grown commercially in other places, including Mexico and Indonesia.

Allspice tends to prefer limestone soils. It is usually grown in hilly areas.
