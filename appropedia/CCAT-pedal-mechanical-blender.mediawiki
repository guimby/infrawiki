'''THE PEDAL POWERED MECHANICAL BLENDER'''
<small>Designed and Built By Bart Orlando and Saremy Graves</small>

The pedal powered mechanical blender was designed by Bart Orlando and built with the assistance of Saremy Graves, an HSU student who received class credit for her participation in the project in 1997. It was used to make smoothies, salad dressings and in the process of creating homemade paper.  A skate board wheel rolls along the side of the exercise bike's flywheel. This spins a driveshaft which is attached to the skateboard wheel. The driveshaft is supported by two pillow blocks. The top end of the driveshaft is modified to mimic the shape of the piece that inserts into the blade assembly at the base of the ingredient container on the original blender.

These features include a larger crank ring for higher gearing and a pivoting pillow block mount plate that can swing the skateboard wheel and drive shaft out of the way when working on the bike. The large crank-ring was custom machined by the Industrial Technology department at HSU. In this way the engines of this university can be harnessed to make practical contributions toward bringing CCAT pedal powered projects to fruition.

Chronical searched for an answer to Enron they featured an article about CCAT on the front page of their paper, ........ "above the fold"!
