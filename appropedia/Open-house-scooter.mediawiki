The Electroscooter should be a relatively simple project as it can rely largely on off-the-shelf hub motor systems commonly made in China and sold in kit form for the electrification of conventional bicycles. The basic design consists of a traditional adult-sized Amish kick-scooter whose front wheel has been equipped with an electric hub motor on its conventional bicycle wheel, with battery pack carried in the front basket. Amish kick-scooters differ from commonly seen scooters in that they are designed specifically for adult use and the varied road conditions of the countryside. They are commonly used in Amish communities as simple personal transportation. Variations are possible based on the use of a CNC plywood chassis design or the use of T-slot profile construction, but the Amish designs are already open source and locally manufactured, offering a fine at-hand example of local open production.
