Bart Orlando demonstrates the [[pedal powered]] grinder which he designed and built with the assistance of [[HSU]] appropriate technology students. An exercise bike is substituted for the [[electricity|electric]] motor.

A fanbelt is wrapped around the outer circumference of the flywheel of the exercise bike and around a pulley mounted on the same drive shaft that the grinding stone and wire brush are mounted. The shaft is supported by two bearing assemblies. A 24 inch wheel rim is welded to the outer circumference of the flywheel in order to keep the belt on track.
