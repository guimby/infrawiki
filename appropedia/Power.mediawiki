:''For electrical power and other forms of power, see '''[[Energy]]'''.''

= Definition =
In a physics term, '''power''' is the rate at which work takes place or energy is transmitted.  It can also be defined as the amount of [[energy]] needed or used to complete an activity over a period of time.

= Units =
The SI unit for power is the the Watt or "W". Other non SI units include:
* horsepower "HP", 
* calories per hour, "cal/hr", and 
* foot pounds per minute "ft-lb/min".

== Equation ==
The equation for power is <math>P = W/t</math>  where P is power, W is work and t is time.  A second equation for power is <math>P = E/t</math> where E is energy and t is time.
