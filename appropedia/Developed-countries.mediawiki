The challenges facing a '''developed country''' include:
*Dramatically reducing their impact on their environment, particularly through [[greenhouse gas emissions]] (''see [[global warming]]''), with affordable political and economic cost. 
*Avoiding [[incentives to pollute]] such as fossil fuel subsidies.
*Maintaining security - ideally through creating a world in which all countries and all people have a stake in the shared prosperity, and thus have a shared interest in peace and cooperation. 
*Aiding poorer countries achieve prosperity sustainably, for example through ending [[agricultural subsidies]] and carefully targeted [[foreign aid]].
