==Background==
Students will have the opportunity to work with the McKinleyville High School (MHS) students and the Humboldt County Office of Education (HCOE) to design lectures tailored to appropriate technology. During the Spring 2017 semester Caroline Stoddard and Kelsey Summers will design a bike power project and corresponding educational curriculum to be delivered in McKinleyville, CA once per week. The intent is to design and construct a bicycle capable of producing electricity. The goal of the class is to provide students with strengths in hands on activities while working to serve the community. This pedal power project also has the potential to provide future curriculum ideas for bike power service learning projects.

==Problem statement==
The primary objective of this project is to develop a mechanical [[pedal power]] bike project capable of powering a blender. MHS students will participate in 50-minute lectures that will focus on the primary tenets of appropriate technology, prototyping, project design, mechanical bike blender construction building and testing. Introductory projects will include a t-shirt to tote bag and DIY notebooks. Depending on student needs, interests and time future projects could include edible garden design and/or papercrete stepping stones.

===Literature Review===

Creating energy from pedal power can be used as a demonstration of what harnessing the human potential can do. Throughout history, human power has been used to meet all sorts of needs. In the 1940’s manual crank devices, including human-powered radio were common but the energy generated from leg-powered devices is much greater. Soon came the advent of bicycle pedal power parts, capable of generating up to 60 Watts of power. <ref> Starner/Paradiso{{www.cc.gatech.edu/~thad/p/.../human-generated-power-for-mobile-electronics.pdf</ref>

That cranking or pedaling motion serves as mechanical energy that is then converted into electrical energy. <ref> Gilmore, A. "Human power: Energy recovery from recreational activity." Guelph Engineering Journal, Guelph 1 (2008): 8-16. </ref>Pedal power can be used to charge a battery or used directly to assist in agricultural processes, operate tools, power blenders, washing machines, devices, light bulbs; the possibilities are vast and can be tailored to fit different objectives and needs. 

Pedal power is often divided into two categories, mechanical and electrical.

====Electric Pedal Power====

Electrical bike power harnesses the mechanical power of pedaling and converts it to electrical energy. Electrical bike design may lose some potential energy between conversion through the generator or alternator and even more so if used in conjunction with a battery.

[[File:Bikepower2.jpg|thumb|left|Basics]]
 
These schematics can be used for any bike by removing the back wheel and mounting the frame. <ref> Ajayi, Arinola B., and Frank N. Okafor. "Development of Improved Dual-Purpose Fitness Bike for Electricity Generation." Development 3.7 (2013). </ref>
 
====Mechanic Pedal Power====

Mechanical bikes use the power of the cranking motion to directly operate some mechanism. 

====Parts====

First things first, you need a bike. Many people recommend using an exercise bike since it solves any bike stabilization issues, others have used training stands, but creating a custom frame or using cinder blocks can also accomplish mounting the bike. 

There are two major modes of power transmission for bicycle attachments, chain drive and friction drive. These two drives can be used to meet the power requirements of most pedal power attachments.

Chain drives should be paired with low-speed devices. Chain drives are more efficient; a study at Johns Hopkins found efficiency rates from 81 % to as high as 96.8 %.  <ref> Spicer, J.B.; Richardson, C.J.K.; Ehrlich, M.J.; Bernstein, J.R. (2000). "On the Efficiency of Bicycle Chain Drives," from Human Power: Technical Journal of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association, Number 50, Spring 2000.
</ref > Chain drives are often used most because of this, however can be more costly and less accessible. 

Belt drives and roller drives are the two main types of friction drives. Belt drives, can be fashioned out of recycled rubber, but eventually stretching is bound to occur especially in humid conditions. <ref> Wu, Jodie. Bicycle-powered attachments: designing for developing countries. Diss. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009. </ref >

A pulley is the simple machine that will generate the mechanical energy. A small pulley on a generator will spin faster than a large one. The type of drive shaft the pulley will be connected to; chain or friction drive will determine the size of the pulley. <ref> CASL and EDC. Portable Pedal Power. A proposal for AAA and Burt Rutan, 2005.</ref>

A generator or alternator is used to create electrical energy. A permanent magnet direct current (DC) motor is typical for pedal power devices. Internal magnets create a magnetic field; generators with ratings of 500 to 1000 rpm are recommended. Using a car alternator is an option but internal electromagnets are capable of running at thousands of rpms, this pace may be too fast for pedal power needs. <ref> CASL and EDC. Portable Pedal Power. A proposal for AAA and Burt Rutan, 2005.</ref>

A diode is a circuit element that allows electrical current to run in one direction and not the other. <ref> https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-semiconductor-devices/ee-diode/v/ee-diode</ref>  

A fuse protects the equipment. When too much current passes through a fuse it pops, also known as an open circuit. The break stops the surge from continuing and protects your electrical system. <ref>magnificentrevolution.org</ref>

A battery is a container of one or more cells that converts chemical energy into electricity that is used as a source of power. 

An inverter is essentially a portable electrical outlet that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. <ref> CASL and EDC. Portable Pedal Power. A proposal for AAA and Burt Rutan, 2005.</ref> 

A Flywheel is a heavy revolving wheel in a machine that stores the energy of your pedaling. This increases the machine's momentum and increases the available power. A heavy wheel with good bearings is recommended. <ref> Preuit Amy. How to set up a Pedal-Powered washing machine </ref> 

Lever Arms can be used to increase power output. A design that has been used for past pedal power projects by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maurice_Houbracken%27s_bicycle.png Maurice Houbracken]

Bike Sprocket/Elliptical Sprocket: “A disc with teeth on its circumference for driving a chain, a general term that applies both to chain rings and to freewheel cogs.” <ref>http://www.engineering-dictionary.org/Sprocket</ref> This is what the bike chain wraps around, sprockets are measured by the number of teeth (pitch) and width. An elliptical sprocket can also increase energy output by using elliptical opposed to circular shaped sprockets. <ref> CASL and EDC. Portable Pedal Power. A proposal for AAA and Burt Rutan, 2005.</ref>

====Teaching bike power====

Pedal power has been used as an educational tool to teach students the basics of energy and power. Exercises can be tailored to highlight mechanics or electricity function, energy efficiency, or environmental concerns. Bike power also gives rise to appropriate technology (AT) and utilizing human power to meet our needs. AT is an important topic to teach youth because it incorporates hands on learning, simple design, maintenance, low cost and local knowledge base. AT uses local resources to solve problems and provide services for people. <ref> nau.edu/CEFNS/Engineering/Mechanical/.../Energy/_.../bike-generator-curriculum/
</ref> 

====Client Criteria====

We are waiting for administrative approval at the Mckinleyville school and a meeting with the teachers from the TLC classroom until we establish project criteria. While planning this project our objective is to remain mindful of the students individual grade levels, since the classroom is a mix of middle schoolers with varying skills and interests. Criteria and constraints are based on information provided by MHS teachers and students.

==Operation==

===Instructions===
Instructions for use are pretty straight forward. Pedaling turns the back wheel which spins against the rotating rod attached to the skateboard wheel powering the blender. Make sure the blender is fully seated and that pedaling is consistent and slow.
