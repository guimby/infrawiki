California Valley Solar Ranch consists of the following proposal:

* 250 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic solar power plant on land zoned Agriculture on the Carrizo Plain.

* solar arrays that would cover nearly 1,900 acres, an electric substation,
operations
* maintenance facilities, public viewing areas, and an approximately
* A 230 kV tieline.

* commercial aggregate surface mine or quarry north of
the solar project where a small surface mine currently exists at the proposed
location north of Highway 58.

Also proposed for that area is the [[Topaz Solar Farm Project]] at a site approximately 4 miles
west.

Endangered species subject to impacts include the [[Giant Kangaroo Rat]], [[San Joaquin ground squirrel]] and [[kit fox]].
==Environmental Impact==

A Draft EIR was released for public comment in 2010.{{Expand}} Many parties have expressed concern (including litigation (Citation needed), because the project is proximal to the Carrizzo Plain National Monument. As described by The Nature Conservancy, the site has a diversity of wildlife comparable to Africa's Serengeti, and the highest concentration of threatened and endangered wildlife in California ‚Äùthese are the
irreplaceable assets of the Carrion Plain National Monument.<ref>http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/california/preserves/art63\|Cited in Bard/URSA Comment on DEIR</ref>
