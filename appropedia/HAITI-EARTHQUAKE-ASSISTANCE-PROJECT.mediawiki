'''This Appropedia Web page is Dedicated to creating an appropriate technology emergency response to the catastrophe in [[Haiti]].''' 

by Bart Orlando [http://www.appropedia.org/Projects_with_Bart][http://www.appropedia.org/HAITI_EARTHQUAKE_ASSITANCE_PROJECT_FOR_HSU_ENGINEERING_305]

Shelter, water pasteurization, cooking food, dealing with human waste, lighting, telecommunications, bathing and methods of aid cargo delivery are essential needs of Haitians that can be provided using appropriate technology. The U.N. now estimates 2 million are left homeless by the earth quake and are now living in makeshift refugee camps. For them, Appropriate Technology could mean the difference between life and death.
