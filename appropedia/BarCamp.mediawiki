A BarCamp is a common and popular type of [[unconference]], where participants give talks (typically 20 to 30 minutes), posting them on a schedule board. Specific talks and timings are arranged on the day. 

Normally there are at least two or three rooms and participants are encouraged to move to a place where they are either learning or otherwise benefiting, or contributing. 

Typically the focus is on tech topics such as Web 2.0, but more specific camps are held, such as [[OpenSustainabilityCamp]], [[EcoCamp]], [[TransitCamp]] and [[BarCampAfrica]]
