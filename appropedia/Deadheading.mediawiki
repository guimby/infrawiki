'''Deadheading''' is the practice of removing spent flowers from plants. The removal of spent flowers encourages the growth of new flowers, as the plant doesn't have to keep sparing energy for the spent flower. It is of special use in the case of annuals, some of which may only flower once if not deadheaded. 

In order to get repeated flowering from flowering plants, remove the spent flowers either by hand or cutting with pruning snips or clean scissors.

Not all plants need deadheading or will be improved by this practice. Do your research on the plant type first, or experiment and see what happens.
