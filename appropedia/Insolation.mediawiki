By definition, '''insolation''' is the incident [[solar]] radiation.  That is, the amount of solar radiation reading the earth per day.  This is usually measured in units of Btu/square ft/d.  

This is the sunlight that directly hits a surface and causes energy in the form of heat.  This [[energy]] that we eventually feel as heat, is due to a nuclear reaction in the sun which is converted into energy.  Only about 19% of this is absorbed by the atmosphere, 31% is reflected by the atmosphere, and the remaining 50% gets to earth absorbed almost totally.
