== Introduction to Potawot ==
United Indian Health Services organization began in 1968 when Native Americans united to provide health care for their people. People from this organization acquired a 40 acre plot of land from the City of Arcata in California known as Potawot Health Village.    Potawot began to construct in the 1990's.  The people of Potawot restored the piece of land into having native plants, wetlands, wellness gardens, and a sanctuary for birds and other wildlife.  

The land around the Village provides many opportunities for people to learn about the ecology, the traditional use of native plants, and other information pertaining to how to live a healthy lifestyle. The site has walking trails, interpretive signage, a basket garden, and is a venue for many cultural and environmental activities. Most importantly, "the restored landscape around the Village is intended to be a comfortable place for United Indian Health Services clients, and a place that fosters the healing of the mind, body and spirit." ([http://uihs.org/index.php United Indian Health Services])

Potawot has restored the landscape to not only be a place where humans can visit, but also where different species of wildlife can also visit.  This includes birds of all species.  The following information provides a short description of the different species of birds that can be found at Potawot.  Some of the birds call this place home and others use this as a temporary spot to stop while traveling through on their migrations.  
 The following descriptions were provided by the Audobon Society and the images are from Eric Johnson which were taken at Potawot.
