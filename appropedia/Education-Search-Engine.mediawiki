This '''Education Search Engine''' finds information from education domains globally, including .edu, and specific country domains such as ac.uk, ac.kr and edu.au. It also includes many university sites which do not fit a higher level education domain, such as queensu.ca. 

As of early 2012 it searches 1384 domains, and more will be added as we come across them. If you find any we've missed, please leave a note on the {{talk page}}.
