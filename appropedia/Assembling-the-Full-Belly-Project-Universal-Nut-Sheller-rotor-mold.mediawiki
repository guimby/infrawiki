== Grease Inner Rotor Mold ==
Locate the '''Inner Rotor Mold (#7)'''. Wipe the smooth exterior surface of the inner rotor mold with cooking grease or heavy oil. This ensures an easy release of the concrete from the mold.

== Insert Rotor Shaft into Outer Rotor Mold ==
Insert the '''Rotor Shaft (#9)''' into the center hole of the '''Outer Rotor Mold (#6), '''threaded end first. The threaded end must be facing down, otherwise you will be unable to assemble your machine.

== Assemble the stool ==
