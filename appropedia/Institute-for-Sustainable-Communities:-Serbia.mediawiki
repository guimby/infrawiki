== Introduction ==

The Institute for Sustainable Communities (ISC) is a nonprofit organization that helps communities grow stronger through sustainable living projects. <ref> http://www.iscvt.org/what_we_do/ </ref>. The organization defines a sustainable community as one that “one that is economically, environmentally, and socially healthy and resilient.” <ref> http://www.iscvt.org/what_we_do/sustainable_community/ </ref>

 “We never come to a country or community and say, ‘This is how you do it.’ We always take great pains to engage the 
 local people and to work with local nonprofits. While we can't provide all the answers, we can offer some hope, some
 technical assistance and education that can help people solve their own problems.”
 — Madeleine M. Kunin, Board Member and Founder, ISC

ISC works in 21 countries around the world, including Russia, China, the United States, Serbia and Poland. It was founded in 1991 by Madeleine Kunin. The Vermont-based company has offices worldwide, in China, Serbia, Washington D.C., and Kosovo. <ref> http://www.iscvt.org/who_we_are/history/ </ref>

===The Green List===

The Green List, an alliance of 12 nonprofit groups in Serbia organized volunteers to take part in helping to collect trash throughout the country. To date, over 525 cubic yards have been collected. <ref> http://www.iscvt.org/how_weve_helped/green_list/ </ref> One such project, ''Oplaneti Se!'', which roughly translates to “Planetize Yourself”, is a campaign created by The Green List that mobilizes community members to taking 
part in environmental activities, such as trash removal, tree planting and environmental education. <ref> http://www.oplanetise.com/ </ref>

 "Society, much like an individual, changes, grows and evolves. Just as an individual can not go through important 
 changes alone, neither can a society without citizens gathered around shared ideas and interests."
