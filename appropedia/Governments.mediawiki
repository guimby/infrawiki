'''Governments''' play a significant role in [[sustainability programs]] and in [[foreign development assistance]]. These roles are often controversial, in regard to the manner of their involvement, the extent of their involvement, and even whether they should be involved at all.

== Governments and development ==
Governments play a very important role in development, spending large sums on development projects. This is the subject of conflicting calls to:
* Greatly increase the level of [[foreign aid]] (e.g. Jeffrey Sachs, Bono)
* Eliminate [[subsidies]] as these [[disempower]] the recipients - notably by the Indian development consultants [[Kamal Kar]] (who developed [[Community-led Total Sanitation]] or CLTS) and [[Dipankar Chakraborti]] (water expert, early whistleblower on [[arsenic in groundwater]] in Bangladesh and India.)
* End [[tied aid]], where aid must be spent on products and services from the donor country
* End development aid and use other means to help development instead (e.g. Dambisa Moyo; William Easterly stops short of this)
* Rethink the aid process - recognize that most aid is not effective or even damaging, and work out how to fix it (e.g. Paul Collier, William Easterly)

== Open government ==
Open government involves:
* [[Open content]], using [[open licenses]] or [[public domain]].
* [[Open data]]
* [[Transparency]]

==Forms of government==
Several forms of government exist, including [[Democracies]], [[Anarchies]], [[Anocracies]], [[Kritarchies]], [[Republics]], [[Theocracies]], [[Monarchies]], [[Oligarchies]], Authoritarian forms of government

One idea that builds further on a council to govern a country has been proposed at [http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcwtr665_14324vr6 this article]
