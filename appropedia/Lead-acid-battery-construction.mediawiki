Remark: image 3 still incorrect, will correct this soon

==Filler material==
Batteries can have either lead oxide (PbO) or lead tetroxide (Pb3O4) as positive filler material.

==Repair==
Appearantly, only the positive plates and filler material are damaged (and not the negative ones) when the life expectancy of the battery has been passed. These will thus generally need to be replaced. Any other parts of the battery will not.<ref>VARTA:Technische leergang: Startbatterijen</ref>
