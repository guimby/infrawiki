The Concrete Gray to Green movement is a recent development with the goal to reduce the evironmental impact of concrete and other cement based construction materials. It has become a topic of high interest for industry leaders, such as the [http://www.cement.org/homes/brief12.asp Portland Cement Association (PCA)], [http://www.nrmca.org/GreenConcrete/ National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NRMCA)], [http://precast.org/2011/09/from-gray-to-green/ National Precast Concrete Association (NPCA)], and the[http://www.usgreenconcretecouncil.com/editorial.htm U.S. Green Concrete Council] and has been publicized by several sources (e.g [http://www.nature.com/news/green-cement-concrete-solutions-1.12460 Nature.com], and [http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/masonry/gray-to-green-how-to-make-cleaner-concrete#slide-3 Popular Mechanics]). 

==The Problem==

Concrete is the most used construction material in the world <ref name="Crow"> Crow, James Mitchell, The concrete conundrum, Chemistry World, March 2008, 62-66 </ref> and according to the [http://www.wri.org/chart/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2005 World Resources Institute (WRI)] 2005 report on world greenhouse gas emissions contributes to 5% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emmissions. In comparison iron and steel only contribute to 4% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This high percentage has been said to be primarily due to the vast amount of the material used in the construction industry.<ref name="Scrivener"> Scrivener, Karen L.  and Kirkpatrick, R. James, Innovation in use and research on cementitious material, Cement and Concrete Research, 38, 2008, 128â€“136 </ref> It is therefore essential that environmental friendly solutions are implimented to improve the sustainability of the world's buildings and infrastructure.

==Solutions==
Much of the research and education consists of mix optimization and using partial replacment alternatives to portland cement, however, other solutions also exist. Two of which are ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) and geopolymer cement concrete.
