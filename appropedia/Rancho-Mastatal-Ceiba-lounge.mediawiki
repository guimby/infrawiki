==Introduction==
[[File:RMSeibaLounge.jpg|thumb|upright=3]]

The Ceiba lounge at [[Rancho Mastatal]] was built using various natural building techniques, including [[cob]], [[wattle and daub]], [[earthen plaster]], [[chorizo]], [[taquezal]], [[natural paint|clay paint]], [[earth bag]], and a nylon web technique. It serves as an example for many of the natural building techniques used around the farm. It is also a space slightly away from the bustle of the main house where one may relax. The roofed area around the lounge will be made into a processing kitchen for making things like cheese, soda balm, stocks, soap, and homemade beer known as "hooch".
