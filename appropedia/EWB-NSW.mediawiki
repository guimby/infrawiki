{{topic header| default.png |EWB NSW}}
[[Engineers Without Borders]] in NSW, Australia. 

Feel free to add information, here or on separate pages. 

==Suggestions==
* Start a page on a project you are or have been involved in (and add {{Cl|EWB Australia projects}} at the bottom, to put it into the category). 
* Work on [[EWB NSW - Coming events]]
* [[Special:Upload|Upload]] pictures (only if they are public domain or free licence, or you own the rights to the pictures because you took them, and you release them under a free licence).

==New to wikis?==
Wikis aren't too hard to use, and there's an introduction at [[Help:Contents]]. And remember - your editing doesn't have to be perfect.

If you're having trouble, ask for help (e.g. at the [[Appropedia:Village Pump|Village Pump]])
