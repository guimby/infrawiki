==Abstract==
<center>''Short abstract describing the project from background to conclusion''</center>

==Background==
Describe the background of the project. Make sure to cover who, what, why, when and where…

==Problem statement==
Start your project objective statement in the format, "The objective of this project is to..." 

===Criteria===
Include a brief intro to the criteria and then include a table with constraints and weights (0-10 highest). Feel free to use the code from examples, such as [[CCAT pedal powered TV#Evaluation Criteria]].

Grading Criteria for previous sections:
* Formatting (should look good, sortable table for criteria) +20
* Thoroughness of content (who, what, when, were, etc.) +40
* Considers audience (this will be read by people outside the US and in the future, consider things such as most people do not know where Arcata is) +30
* Extra (e.g. images) +10

== Literature Review ==
Introduce the literature review briefly and then use heading and subheadings for topics.  This should focus on information… NO PLAGIARISM! Make sure to see assignments on Moodle.<ref>For example at [[305 literature review template]] you will see the recommendation to use [[Help:Footnotes]].</ref>

Grading criteria for Literature Review:
* Formatting (should look good, see Appropedia suggested formatting) +20
* Thoroughness of research (at least 3 books and 1 peer reviewed journal per person... lots of credible web refs) +40
* Uses reference format +30
* Extra (amazing sources) +10

== Prototyping ==
Show examples of the prototyping process including what you learned.

==Construction==
Very complete description of how final project is made. This large section should have lots of pictures. Use the [[Help:Images#Galleries]] and probably [[Template:How_to]] (e.g. [[Barrel O' Fun Worm Bin Instructions]]). 

===Timeline===
Introduce the timeline and include a table of the timeline. 

Grading criteria for timeline:
* Spelling and grammar +15
* Completeness of timeline +35
* Table formatting +15
* Timeline introduced +15
* Separate columns for propose and actual completion date.

===Costs===
Description of costs, donations, the fact that this is just proposed, etc.
See [[Help:Table_examples#Cost_Table]] for a very nice looking table format.

Grading criteria for costs:
* Formatting (should look good, see [[Help:Table_examples#Cost_Table]] formatting) +20
* Thoroughness and up-to-dateness of budget (should display necessary components, including donations, have an introduction, etc)  +40
* Mathematical accuracy +30
* Extra (sortable, etc) +10

== Operation ==
This is how to operate. It should have a brief introduction and very useful images with labels. Also it may work best for your project to use the step by step how to template {{Tl|How to}}. See [[#Troubleshooting]] for an example.

=== Maintenance ===
Introduce this maintenance section.

=== Schedule ===
This is when to maintain what. 
<!-- Please keep the format the same as it populates the kiosk in CCAT. -->

;Daily

;Weekly

*a weekly task

;Monthly
*a monthly task
*a monthly task

;Yearly
*a yearly task
*a yearly task

;Every __ years
*task
*task

=== Instructions ===
This is how to maintain. The step by step how to template {{Tl|How to}} is most likely best for this part. 

{{How to
 |title=How to Do Something
 |File:Bpack bike trailer - demo 1.jpg |Backpack frame bike trailer |1 |Do something.
 |File:Aleiha dish.jpg |Aleiha's parabolic solar cooker |2 |Do something really complicated but made simple, etc.

===Next steps===
Discuss any next steps for the project as it goes on into the future.

=== Troubleshooting ===
This is only how to troubleshoot basic operation. For complex issues, the solution might just say contact ________. It should be a table in this format:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Problem
! Suggestion
|-
| Example issue
| Example solution or suggestion
|-
| Does not turn on
| Make sure it is plugged in
|-
