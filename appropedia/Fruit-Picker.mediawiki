==Abstract==
# This project is made for people who wish to pick unreachable fruit from trees. Forcing fruit out of a tree causes it to bruise and spoil quicker than that that is picked from with care. The fruit picker is printed in two parts. It uses a regular 2 liter soda bottle along with five screws to assemble. It does also require an old broom handle or piece of pipe to use as a handle. This is a cheaper alternative to what is already on the market and is more universal in the handles it can use.

== Bill of Materials==
CAD Files
*[[File:Fork.scad|Fork]]
*[[File:Stem.scad|Stem]]
Extra Parts
*1/8" x 3/8" sheet metal screw (x2)
*1/4" x 1-1/4" machine screw (x3)

== Tools needed for fabrication==
# 3D printer
# Equivalent screw drivers to match screws used 

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* There is no special skills needed to make this tool.

== Technical Specifications==
# If any changes to the design want to be done, open the SCAD file and adjust the parameters.
# Slicing instructions:
## Fill % = 50 
## Speed = 70 mm/sec
## Layer Height = .15 mm
## No support Needed
# Print time with above settings will be about 3 hours per part

== Assembly Instructions==
# Cut bottom off of 2 liter bottle at desired location
# Screw sheet metal screws through bottle so they line up with holes in poth 3D printed parts
# Evenly screw last three screws to fix to handle

== Cost savings==
Cost of creating this hammer
   *Filament needed: 82 grams @ $22.98/kg = $1.88
   *Hardware needed: 5 screws @ $1.50
   *At a total cost of $3.38
Commercial Equivalents
   *Equivalent: $10.69
