==About Us==

This is a student discussion group hosted by the MES students at Queen's University in Kingston, ON.

=====Vision=====

‘To provide a social and intellectual space where knowledge is freely shared, passionate discussions are expected and taking action on ideas is encouraged’

=====Goals=====

'''1. Provide a venue where members can discuss (i.e. hash out) environmental issues that they consider important/interesting.''' 

In order to facilitate this activity, one member will be asked to lead each meeting; this will be done on a rotational basis. The leading member will be responsible for selecting an article, book chapter, film clip etc. for all members to review before the meeting. S/he will also be responsible for providing the members with easy access to the selected article or other media.  Finally, s/he will facilitate the discussion amongst group members.

'''2. Facilitate learning and [[knowledge sharing]]  amongst MES students, as well as campus community members and members of the greater community of Kingston.'''
 
There are several ways that this knowledge sharing will be encouraged. First, members will be encouraged to invite guest speakers to the group meetings (the leader may elect to invite a guest speaker rather than assign an article for discussion). Second, members will be asked to invite friends, family members, colleagues, etc. to group meetings. Third, the group will engage in activities that involve interacting with other campus and community members. Fourth, the group will utilize technology platforms such as Wiki to encourage communication and to raise the profile of the group.
(Note:  membership to the group is not formal, nor is it restricted to MES students. The hope of the group is to keep the membership fluid, with a core group of members dedicated to ensuring momentum is maintained) 

'''3. Identify and engage in environmentally-related activities within and outside the School of Environmental Studies.'''

These activities might include volunteering at environmental events in Kingston, as well as organizing events on behalf of or in conjuction with the SES, such as an Environmental Studies week (opportunity for SES to profile its programs and students), Seminar Speakers Series, etc. 

'''4. Enhance communication and share information amongst group members, SES and Queen’s campus community.'''

Communication and information sharing to be facilitated through various methods. The group will develop a website/wiki which will serve as a main source of information regarding group meetings, SES events, campus events, community events, conferences, etc.  Discussion group meetings will also serve to facilitate communication and information sharing.  Social networking and marketing opportunities may also be considered if/when the group see these as beneficial.

'''5.  Identify and seek to answer questions or address challenges faced by MES students with respect to the MES program.''' 

In this respect, senior (i.e. 2nd year) group members will be available to mentor first year students and answer questions they may have regarding the MES program. Members may also, on occasion, serve as a sounding board for fellow students with respect to their research work (i.e. providing feedback on research design etc.).  Members will also be invited to raise any challenges they are encountering with regards to meeting program requirements or finding pertinent information pertaining to the program (e.g. thesis defense details).  The group may also search out ways to assist students in job hunting (e.g. by organizing networking events, etc.)
