'''Hookworms''' are a parasite passed through feces, and picked up through the feet. They can crawl up to 4 feet (1.2 m) through sandy soil, and die after around 7 days.

This is an excellent reason for:
* Proper [[sanitation]], including adequate storage times and separation from areas used by humans. The principle of [[outhouses]] keeping [[human waste]] 6 feet (1.8 m) below the surface is based on the abilities on the hookworm.
* Wearing [[footwear]] in areas where [[fecal contamination]] might be present.
