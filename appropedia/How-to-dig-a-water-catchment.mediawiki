#[[Water catchments]] need [[Clay]] [[Soil]]. [[Sand]]y soil will allow water to leak. (This is fine as a step in [[Groundwater recharge]], but no good for a catchment.) 
#Don't dig new water catchments without knowing about the soil underneath.&nbsp; Expanding existing water catchments may be a better idea. 
#Find out where the clay layer finishes, and don't dig past it. If you do, or there is any leakage, use more clay to patch it. 
#Where evaporation is high, water catchments should be deeper and narrower. Shallow and wide means more water lost to evaporation. 
#Look at water quality as well as quantity. E.g. use a [[Sedimentation trap]] or [[Settling pool]] to allow [[Sedimentation]], reducing solids (including soil and animal waste). An [[Infiltration well]] is a useful step in improving water quality. 
#Manage the catchment. Look at inlets and the catchment area.<br>
