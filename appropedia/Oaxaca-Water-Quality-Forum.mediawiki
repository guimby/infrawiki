===The Need for Healthy Forests===
Forests affect watershed quality. Cutting down forests removes a protective layer over the soil and increases rains erosive impacts.

===Impacts of Large Dams and Hydropower===
There are 667 dams in Mexico, which have altered or fragmented about 60% of the rivers in Mexico.  40- 60 million people have been displaced for these dams directly, and possible 60-100 million have been displaced indirectly.  About 30 to 40% of the farms in Mexico are irrigated with the water from these dams and 19% of the electricity is generated.  
Problems from Dams discussed: 
*Those people displaced by a dam are often relocated to areas much higher up in areas of dense forest and sloped hillsides, where they need to cut the forest in order to make for themselves a new home and farm. Forest removal reduces the precipitation and therefore reduces the current of the river, making the seasonal influx become permanent.

*The diversion of water from its normal course and naturally irrigated areas to artificially irrigated areas creates problems of saturation and salinity in the soil.
