'''Garden fleece''' or '''horticultural fleece''' refers to a special fabric used to protect young and tender plants in the garden or in outdoor containers. The main protection offered is against frost and the cold, although it can also keep off some pests as well as a side effect.

Garden fleece can be used to protect the blossom on fruit trees if frost is predicted or for sudden unexpected weather changes.

The fleece is usually made from a polypropylene fabric that is both thin and unwoven.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticultural_fleece</ref> It lets through light, air and moisture but protects from frost and creates a microclimate that helps the protected plant to grow.<ref name="wp" />
