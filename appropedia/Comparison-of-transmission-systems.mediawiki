This article details the advantages and the disadvantages so that one can determine which trensmission is best for each particular task.

ie a CVT shifts quicker, does not require a clutch and has a broader range of gears. It is more complicated to design, and is much less durable as a manual transmission
a manual transmission requires a clutch, shifts less quick, and has a more limited range of gears. It is however much more durable than a CVT

--> User:Armlamp's 3D model of a manual transmission needs to be reworked, and reuploaded (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=cb30b1bbcad7ca2788e7662971dc736f&prevstart=0 In ). Then, snapshots need to be taken to replace the earlier pictures at wikimedia commons.

--> A 3D model of an AT manual transmission has been made by Torch for Appropedia. See http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=de93ddad1c32aaa3aee554f9566360dd

--> A CVT 3D model needs to be made, ie using an already modelled (incomplete) CVT from an all terrain vehicle (http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=35c553f6a4abe52498a754607d664cbe&prevstart=0 ). The model can be made using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission#Uses and http://www.usaatvs.com/pdf/CVT%20Basics%20Guide.pdf
