== Definitions ==
; Depth:
: Determines how much of the page hierarchy will be displayed. Legal values are <code>0, 1, 2, 3, and full</code>. <code>Full</code> represents an effective depth of 100. If no depth value is specified, a default of 0 will be used.
: '''Note:''' Depth has no impact on report data.
; Titles:
: Set of page titles to query on. Category pages must start with the prefix ''category:''

== Exporting ==
Reports may be exported into CSV and MediaWiki formats. The report is available for direct copy or download from the exports menu.

== Direct Links ==
Apprount is fully RESTful meaning results can be accessed directly. Queries must be formatted as so:
; Syntax using EBNF:
: <code>pequals.com/apprount/?[depth=<depth>&]titles=<title>[{|<title>}]</code>
; Example queries:
: <code>pequals.com/apprount/?titles=energy|category:microhydro</code>
: <code>pequals.com/apprount/?titles=category:hydropower&depth=full</code>

== About ==
