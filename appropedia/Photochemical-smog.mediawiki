== Definition ==

A type of [[air pollution]] that results from the chemical reaction between airborn pollutants and high amounts of ultraviolet radiation. The products of this chemical reaction then go onto function as catalysts which may then act as [[atmospheric pollutants]] and contribute to [[ozone depletion]].

== Components ==

* Nitrous Oxides
* Hydrocarbons ( [[Volatile Organic Compounds]] (V.O.C.))
* Ultraviolet Radiation
* Oxygen

== Factors Contributing to Pollutants ==

* Fossil fuel burning (ie.) Coal burning, automotive emissions,  
* Man-made chemicals (ie.) Pesticides, solvents, nail polish removers
* Natural biological phenomenon

== Alternatives ==
The alternatives methods listed below can help to reduce the production of air pollutants, and thus photochemical smog.

* Riding bike/ walking
* Utilizing energy efficint techniques 
* Substitute plant based products for man made products
