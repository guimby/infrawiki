'''Really Simple Reporting''' or '''RSR''' is an [[SMS]] capable reporting and monitoring service from [[Akvo]][http://www.akvo.org/] which is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It is designed for [[accountability]] and assessment in [[international development]], and is intended as a tool for [[open development]].

The concern leading to the development of RSR was that established processes don't scale easily or well, and that reporting often becomes complicated even when it was intended to be simple. A key design goal was to ensure that the process of monitoring and reporting stays really simple.<ref>[http://www.akvo.org/blog/?p=161 RSR + RSS = Making monitoring more efficient] Akvo.org blog, 8 October 2008 by Malte Beckmann.</ref>
