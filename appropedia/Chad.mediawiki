'''2009'''

Mahamat ZÃ¨ne Bada, the mayor of Chad's capital [[N'djamena]], has noted that irregular rainfall patterns and deforestation in and around the city had led to major flooding in 1999, 2001 and 2008. The city is flanked by two rivers and most people rely on wood products for energy, which causes the deforestation. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=562&ArticleID=6096&l=en&t=long United Nations Environment Programme]</ref> February 27
