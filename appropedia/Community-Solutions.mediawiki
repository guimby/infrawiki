The '''Arthur Morgan Institute for Community Solutions''', founded in 1940 as Community Service, Inc., is a non-profit organization that educates on the benefits and values of small local community living. We envision a world where people live sustainably and cooperatively in [[local communities]] which are diverse, equitable, and just.

The Community Solutions program, started in 2003, is a national resource for knowledge and practices on [[low-energy living]] and [[self-reliant communities]]. We educate about the coming global [[peak oil|oil production peak]] and [[climate change]], and design solutions to the current unsustainable, fossil-fuel based, overly centralized way of living.

Community Solutions seek alternatives to both non-renewables ([[hydrogen]], large scale coal/gas-to-liquids, [[carbon sequestration]], [[tar sands]]) and renewables (large scale [[wind]] systems, [[biofuels]], [[solar]]) that are risky and intended to maintain inequitable and unsustainable levels of resource consumption.
