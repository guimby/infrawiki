==Problem being addressed==
Infants who have difficulty breastfeeding can miss out on the many benefits of breastfeeding and face a greater risk for malnutrition. Since breast pumps can often harbor infectious pathogens in water in low-hygiene settings, the WHO recommends that mothers of children with feeding difficulties produce breast milk into a small cup and use the cup to feed the child.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Neonatal Intuitive Feeding TechnologY, or NIFTY, Infant Feeding Cup, is an easy to clean, easy to use technology that seeks to address the needs of both mother and child. It is designed to be simple for the mother to capture expressed milk, and to be simple to feed to the infant.
