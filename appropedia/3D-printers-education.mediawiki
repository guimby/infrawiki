This page summarizes likes useful for integrating open-source 3D printing into education at any level.

Open-source 3D printing can be used to enhance education while focusing on methods to minimize costs by leveraging free and open source sharing by
# printing low-cost science lab tools - see [[3D printable science equipment]]
# making low-cost 3D visual aids to illustrate challenging concepts,
# helping students clearly see the benefits of mastery of mathematics and computer programming, and
# the ability to enhance hands-on learning by using the 3D printer to prototype student ideas.
