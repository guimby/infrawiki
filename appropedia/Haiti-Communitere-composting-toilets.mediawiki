==Overview==
There are a few [[composting toilets]] at [[Haiti Communitere]]. The image to the right is of an [[Haiti Communitere Ubuntu Blox house|Ubuntu Blox]] composting toilet made with support from [https://www.givelove.org/ Give Love]. A bucket is placed underneath the toilet seat, and after every use some dried sugar cane shavings from a local rum factory are tossed into the bucket. Every week [https://www.oursoil.org/ SOIL] comes to Haiti Communitere to take the buckets of waste from them. They turn the waste into compost and sell it to farmers and gardeners. Composting toilet remedies issues of poor or non-existing sewage systems and insufficient nutrients in soil by turning a waste product into a resource. These composting toilets, along with a [[Haiti Communitere biodigester toilet|biodigester toilet]], process all of the waste for Haiti Communitere.
