The availability of clean safe water in underdeveloped countries around the world is a huge problem. [http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=13&ReportId=61155 1]   
“Worldwide, 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean water, and 2.6 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation” [http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=13&ReportId=61155 1]   

Every twenty seconds a child dies due to unclean water and  3.75 million people die each year because of diseases that are related to dirty   unsanitary water.[http://water.org/water-crisis/water-facts/water/ 2] 

In addition to health concerns there are also social concerns that are caused by the lack of clean water, such as having to defecate under unsafe conditions at night in secluded areas, therefore putting women at risk for violent attacks.  [http://nikawater.org/the-crisis/ 3] Many children are not able to attend school due to the lengthy and tiring process of securing water. [http://nikawater.org/the-crisis/ 3]
