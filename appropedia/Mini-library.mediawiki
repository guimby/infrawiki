'''Mini libraries''' (also called '''micro libraries''', '''community bookshelves''', or '''book boxes''') are small-scale, sharable book and media collections similar to public libraries. The concept is often explained in the simple phrase "take a book, leave a book". Mini libraries may be initiated by community organizations, private individuals or even public library systems. The mini library concept is remarkable in its deployment all around the world, and the creative methods for sharing the collections. Probably the most prominent mini library initiative is the Little Free Library. A related concept is Book Crossing, which focuses more on individual books than small collections.
