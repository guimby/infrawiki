'''Integrated cooking''' combines the use of: 
# An appropriate [[solar cooker]] model whenever the sun is shining; 
# A [[retained heat cooker]] (hay basket or fireless cooker) to extend cooking time and keep food hot for 3-4 hours after cooking; and 
# An [[improved cookstove]] (i.e. efficient cook stove) for use when there is not sufficient sunshine.
