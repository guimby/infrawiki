There are many post-mining communities around the world that face economic hardship and are left with abandoned mine shafts. These mine shafts then fill with water and are kept warm by the surrounding ground and thus provide a  source of potential energy. The warm water in these mines can be used as [[geothermal energy]] to heat and cool buildings, giving communities energy beneath their feet.
