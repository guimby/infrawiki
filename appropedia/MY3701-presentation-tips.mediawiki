# No note cards or notes
# Never point out your own ignorance
# Never slam yourself unless it is funny (really funny)
# Never apologize for being boring (corollary: Do not be boring)
# Never say anything wrong
# Make eye contact, be confident
# Choose something you are interested in and excited about

=== Presentation ===
# Stick to time limit
# Make your slides readable -- all of them and all text on them
# Do NOT make slide transitions the highlight of your talk
# Minimize all text slides
# Limit visual distractions (a few are ok)
# Annotate or put refs on slide page
# Fully read background on your topic
# Provide sufficient evidence for all claims
# Do not speculate
# Make sure you understand the science before you stand up
# Only cite primary sources -- wikipedia is a good tool but always a secondary source
# This is not a history class - do not spend too much time on it
# Make your own equations so that variables are consistent
