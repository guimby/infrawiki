==Abstract==
* This project is designed so that it could be used for tracking the sun light and convert it to electrical power using the solar panel. I have very simple designs without curves and complexity. Integration is simple. Principal behind the working is simple. I have used simple photo resistors to track the sun light which are placed in the same plane of the solar panel to get maximum power output. I have attached scad and stl files below which shows the design of the setup. Because the electronic parts integration is also involved in this project, I have uploaded rest of the data on the other page where I have shown all the steps for integration of the mechanical design and the electrical circuit integration and the code explanation.

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
* [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* [[MY4777|MY4777/MY5777/EE4777/EE5777: Open-source 3-D printing]].
* OpenSCAD
* Slic3r
* Printrun

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
All these project needs is printing the parts with a 3D printer and assembling them using the instructions given in the page link given below.

Because the electronic parts integration is also involved in this project, I have uploaded rest of the data on the other page where I have shown all the steps for integration of the mechanical design and the electrical circuit integration and the code explanation.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Because the design is very simple there is just one problem you will face. It is the placement of the solar panel holder shaft--adjusting the length and gluing it together with the servo motor. But that too is fairly simple, you just need to do it carefully.

== Cost savings==
Because that's just printing part you will save 90% of the cost as needed for the other setups available in the market.
