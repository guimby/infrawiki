# Picture of completed print seen to the right [[Image:IMG_4934.JPG|200px|right]]
This OSAT prototype is a community comment box where members can drop in comments that can not be removed other than by removing the lock from the back. This fulfills the need for communities to provide a location for honest feedback that can not be tampered with.
