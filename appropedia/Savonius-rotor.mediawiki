[[Image:savonius.gif|right|Savonius]] The rotors are not as effective compared to other low-cost windmills. For example, "The data from Bodek and Simonds' experimental S-rotor in the West Indies shows that the useful energy from a 12 mph wind ... means that one can pump 75 Imperial gallons/hour up to 30' above the water level (341 liters/hour up to 9.14 m). In an 8 mph wind ... only 25 Imperial gallons/hour (104 liters/hour) can be pumped to the same height." 

This is not quite as good as the 5.4 m Cretan sail windmill, which is reported to pump as much as 15 times this volume of water in an 8 mph wind. Low-cost sail or [[bamboo]] mat windmills in Thailand also appear to be considerably more productive.
