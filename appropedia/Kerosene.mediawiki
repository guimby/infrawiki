Kerosene is widely used for [[lighting]] and [[cooking]] in [[less developed countries]].

It can be an improvement over [[traditional biofuels]] such as [[wood]] and [[dung]] in terms of [[indoor smoke]]. However it can be a safety hazard, as a stove or lamp can be knocked over and start a [[house fire]].
