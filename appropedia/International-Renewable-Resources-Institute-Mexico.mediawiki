=='''Mission'''==
The mission of the International Renewable Resources Institute-Mexico (IRRI-Mexico) is to promote programs and businesses that produce [[sustainable]] goods and services and help reduce human reliance on [[fossil fuels]] and consumptive resource allocation.  IRRI-Mexico supports rural and low-income communities with the objective of improving the quality of life through generating, developing, and conserving local resources.  IRRI’s vision is sustainable and equitable prosperity in a world without contamination.

=='''About IRRI-Mexico'''==
IRRI-Mexico works with a number of renewable and efficient energy technologies, water treatment and purification systems, and agricultural management strategies in order to address the complex environmental challenges that Mexico and the world face today.  We offer a wide variety of courses, consulting services, project management, and products in order to build human capacity and promote direct positive environmental change.  Through strategic alliances with community members, government and non-governmental organizations, and educational facilities we are able to provide a wide network of services without forgetting the importance of the individual personalities of each project.

=='''Up-Coming Events and Courses'''==
'''[[Appropriate Technologies]] for the Developing World'''
With '''Solar Energy International'''
 
'''Help install a working biodigester for a family in Eronga, Michoacan, Mexico. Join our Hands-on Biodigester Installation Course, August 8-10th, 2008'''

This three-day course will cover an overview of biodigester applications, and the impacts this technology can have on the energy production, health, water quality, emissions and economics of households and communities. The science of [[anaerobic digestion]] and its many applications will be covered, but the course focus will be the installation of a functioning biodigester and working with the family members to design, install, and support the system.

The goal is to provide a fuel source to a local family for cooking and heating as well as a waste treatment system for the production of organic fertilizer. Biodigesters convert [[organic waste]] into clean [[renewable energy]] for heating, cooking, or the production electricity and has the potential to make significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The byproduct of biodigesters is a high quality organic fertilizer that can support local agricultural systems. IRRI-Mexico is promoting an inexpensive, yet durable design that can be easily installed and maintained in a variety of contexts.

This installation will primarily be taught in Spanish, but there will be opportunities for translation English. Translation and extra time can be given to those who need clarification or more English materials.  

'''Course Cost:''' $275 USD for an evening session and two days of installation and helps support the installation of the equipment. Does not include lodging, food or local transportation, but arrangements can be for all of these by IRRI, and inexpensive options (less than $30 USD/day) are available. Discounts are available for students or renewable energy installation program representatives.

This course will be taught in both English and Spanish.

=='''Projects'''==
'''Adopt-a-Biodigestor'''

Help improve the lives of people in rural Mexico by adopting a biodigestor, a system that converts organic waste into a methane gas mixture which can be used for cooking, heating, and generating electricity. Through the International Renewable Resources Institute (IRRI) and SEI you can provide a custom installed biodigester for a family in rural Mexico. These systems receive manure and agricultural waste from small family farms and convert it into a high quality soil amendment, while producing methane gas. In many cases it can provide enough gas for all of a family's cooking and heating energy needs.

Any size donation is welcome, but people donating $500 or more receive an IRRI Mexico Biodigester Manual, photos of the construction process and biodigester you helped install, and a certificate for your participation in the program.

International tax deductible donations can be made at the Solar Energy International Website: http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaID=124186
