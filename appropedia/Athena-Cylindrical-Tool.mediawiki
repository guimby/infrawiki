The cylindrical tool mount can be made to fit either the large or small tool effector.

= Assembly =

# [[File:Athena_cylindrical_dressing.JPG|thumb|right|Dress the print.]] Clean up the print and scrape out the bearing pockets with the small screwdriver.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_cylindrical_nut.JPG|thumb|right|Press in the M3 nut.]] Press the M3 nut into its pocket.{{clear}}
# Remove all grease and corrosion inhibitor from the ball bearings. Use acetone if necessary.
# [[File:Athena_cylindrical_bearings.JPG|thumb|right|Put bearings on magnets.]] Put the ball bearings on the three inner magnets on the bottom or bottom (depending upon how it is to be used) of the small tool effector.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_cylindrical_tool_epoxy.JPG|thumb|right|Epoxy bearing pockets.]] Mix a small amount of epoxy and smear some around the interiors of the bearing pockets. Align the fiduciary marks on the sprung tool mount and small tool effector and squeeze the sprung tool mount onto the ball bearings. Set aside to let epoxy cure. NOTE: If too much epoxy is applied to the bearing pockets, it can run down and epoxy the tool mount permanently to the tool effector.{{clear}}
