=Abstract=
The need for connecting the MOST Delta printer with a PC using USB cable could be eliminated by implementing this simple hack. 
This makes the printer a stand alone device within the range of bluetooth.

=Building=


==Setting up JY-MCU bluetooth module==
*The JY-MCU module need to be programmed to receive the g-code instructions from the computer.
*This can be done by programming up the module by hooking up with Arduino and programming it with AT commands.

*Connect the Arduino UNO microcontroller and JY MCU Module using a breadboard and some jumper wires to make connections.
The following images show the schematic of the required connections and the actual setup.

}}

NOTE: The TX pin of the Bluetooth is connected to pin 10 and RX pin of the Bluetooth is connected to pin 11
      

*Open Arduino IDE and select the board type to Arduino UNO and the corresponding COM port

*Copy and paste the following Code found at Github[https://github.com/jayantchalke/Bluetooth_Melzi.git] in the compiler 

*Now click on the serial monitor icon and wait for the following message

 Starting config
 OK
 OKlinvorV1.8
 OKsetPIN
 OKsetname
 OK115200
 Done!


*You are all set now
*But Instead if you get the following message, then try changing the mySerial.begin baud rate


 Starting config




  
 Done!

*You may need to play with the mySerial.begin baud rate as it varies from firmware to firmware installed on the JY-MCU module 

*Once the serial monitor output is as desired, you may try pairing the device with you PC using the pass code as set in the Arduino code (0000 set in the code provided)

*This generates 2 COM ports to communicate with.
*Open your bluetooth settings and note down the corresponding outgoing COM port number generated after pairing the device. 
*Now open Repetier Host software and to printer setting and select the same COM port as noted before

==Soldering on Melzi Board==
Overall 5 wires needed to be soldered on the melzi board

}}

*Connect the RX pin on the Bluetooth ----> TX wire soldered on Melzi
*Connect the TX pin on the Bluetooth ----> RX wire soldered on Melzi

*Ensure that the shorting block on the controller power supply selector pins in the middle of the printer controller are set so the right-most pair of pins are shorted (controller powered over VREG) as shown in the picture.

==Pairing the Device and Printing==
*Connect the Delta printer to power supply, the bluetooth dongle should start rapidly flashing red light.
*Now open Repetier Host and connect the printer as you would usually do (provided you have followed the change of printer settings as elaborated in the previous steps)
*You should see a solid red light instead of a flashing one. This means the device is successfully paired

*Try homing the printer using manual home button
*If it homes, you should have successfully configured the device and made your printer wireless!
