== Humboldt Interdisciplinary STEM Initiative ==

"Math and Science teachers in grades 6-12 from Fortuna, Arcata, McKinleyville, and the Trinity River Valley have been invited to attend and participate in the [https://fesd-ca.schoolloop.com/hisi Humboldt Interdisciplinary STEM Initiative (HISI)].

HISI will combine professional development in STEM content with collaborative teacher teams. These teams will engage with the lesson study model to support each other in STEM pedagogy as we all move to implement the Common Core. The STEM-focused training will support existing school initiatives to prepare teachers to successfully engage their students with the critical thinking skills necessary for the Smarter Balance Assessments.

Through coaching from teacher leaders from each high school (or one of its feeder schools), participating teacher leaders will receive training to prepare them to support their fellow teachers—with the ultimate goal of nurturing students who are prepared for college and career readiness. Teacher teams will develop, pilot, and finalize common core aligned lessons that integrate algebraic and scientific critical thinking skills that will ultimately be, after practice and refinement, used throughout Humboldt County schools as model STEM Lessons." <ref>https://fesd-ca.schoolloop.com/hisi</ref>

File:IMG_0586_2.JPG.jpeg|[[RCEA_Energy-Caters]] Modeling Renewable Energy is a three period lesson plan designed to educate sixth grade students on many types of renewable energy including wind, hydro, solar, wave, biomass.  Lesson one  is a hypothetical situation, Lesson two is a model landscape, Lesson three is a class debate.
File:Dock1.jpg|[[RCEA_Bust-A-Watt]] Bust-A-Watt educates middle school students through a weeklong curriculum about energy conservation through hands on activities, interactive discussions, home assessment assignments, and  a reflective art assignment. 
File:Layout.png|[[RCEA_CAN_YOU_WorKIT]] CAN YOU WorKIT is designed to teach high school student about conservation of energy.  In one or two class periods students assemble and operate a hand crank electrical generators in order to understand the connection between work and energy. An activity worksheet helps students observe the amount of work that goes into powering every day appliances.
File:Team_Aero.jpg|[[RCEA_Energy_in_a_Cinch]] The Energy In A Cinch kit is designed to teach High School students about renewable energy through the use of a Windbelt. The kit contains a powerpoint presentation on RE and Wind, and material to build five complete Windbelts of various sizes.
