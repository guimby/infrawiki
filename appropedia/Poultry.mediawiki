'''Flightless birds''' are kept for [[eggs]], [[meat|animal flesh]], [[pest control]] services and [[waste management]] services (eating leftover human food).

==Types of birds==
The type of flightless birds that are kept are often large birds such as:
* Birds which are flightless only if their wings are clipped: 
** [[chickens]]
** [[ducks]]
** [[geese]]
* Birds which are truly flightless:
* [[ostrich]]es
* [[emus]]

===Chickens===
Due to their small size (which makes them a viable option for private persons/small residences) and the pest control, and waste management services they provide, aswell as a steady supply of eggs and meat, they are often able to provide considerable ecologic benefit. However, they are nonetheless an exotic species in any country (being a human-bred cultivar of the Red Junglefowl). As such, care must be taken to avoid them reproducing in the wild in your region. Atleast provide confinement (fencing).
