# Second extruder nozzle using foam rubber or plastic for high speed infill
# A foaming material can be utilized in combination with large scale machines to quickly prototype large objects
# Heat resistant, high density foam rubber can be used as a print surface, and would maker for relatively easy print removal
# Lock a section of disposable sponge around the start or end of extruder drives to clean filament before it enter the system
# Optimize infill gcode to create 3 dimensional infill structure for structural integrity at similar density to more common infill structures
# A sponge, in lieu of a hotend, could be injected with ink or paint to paint pictures on print surface
# A sponge, in lieu of a hotend, could be used to thoroughly clean the print surface
# Injection molded sponge structure (heat resistant) could be used as a buffer between heated bed and body of printer
# Sponge mounted against hobbed bolt/extruder drive could clean the drive gear as it extrudes
# Sponge mounted to linear bearings (on applicable printers) could keep the guide rods clear of debris
