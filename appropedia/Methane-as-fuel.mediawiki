[[Image:Methane production.PNG|thumb|400px| This is one example of how methane fuel can be produced sustainably. More info can be found from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis Wikipedia:Electrolysis] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction Wikipedia:SabatierReaction]]]

'''Methane''', CH<sub>4</sub>, is the lightest (least dense) and simplest [[hydrocarbon]]. It is the major constituent of [[natural gas]], and a potent 
[[greenhouse gas]].

==Production==
{{Main|Methane generator}}

Many biological processes produce it as it is a a byproduct of [[fermentation]] and [[composting]]. This method of production is called [[methanogenesis]]. Methanogenesis generally combines '''water with CO²''' to form methane. <ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090330111257.htm Methane production using methanogenesis]</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090330111257.htm Methane production using biohydrogen]</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/07/10/will-cambrian-innovation-revolutionize-waste-water-treatment/ Methane generation using microorganisms being looked into by Cambrian Innovation for commercial use]</ref> This is done in a device known as a [[Methane reactor]]<ref>Also called [[microbial electrolysis cell]] (MEC), yet the latter is also used for generating hydrogen</ref>

Besides using a MEC, another biological process can be used to produce methane. This process uses a [[Biogas|biodigester]]. Basically, [[biogas]], which contains methane, can be used: the methane is simply separated out of the biogas-mixture. Besides biogas, the same technique can be used with [[natural gas]] (both gases basically containing the same gases). This method hence does not use electricity at all, but in some cases this may also be a disadvantage is it then doesn't allow to store the electricity ie generated using PV-panels.

It can also be produced chemically. The first artificially production method uses electricity and is called the '''Sabatier process'''. This process basically combines '''CO² and hydrogen (H²)'''. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_process

A second chemical production method is called [[coal gasification]]. [[Coal]] can be converted into [[syngas]] and [[methane]] (also known as [[town gas]]). The methane can then be separated out of the town gas. This production method however is -as clear- not environmentally friendly at all.

==Storage==
Methane has fewer storage problems than hydrogen. It ie does not leak through materials as easily as hydrogen, meaning that regular tanks can be used. 

==[[Syngas]] conversion==
Methane can be converted to [[syngas]]. This is done using a process called [[steam reforming]]. Basically, at high temperatures (700–1100 °C), steam (H2O) reacts with the methane (CH4) and yields [[syngas]]. '''As syngas is a gas that is much less easy to store, the uses of this process are limited.'''

==Uses==
* Methane can be used very easily for low pressure/relatively low heat uses, such as [[mantle lighting]] or [[cooking]].

* It can be used as a vehicle [[fuel]], yet then requires pressurisation (so a [[gas compressor]] needs to be added to the system<ref>[http://www.environmental-protection.org.uk%2Fassets%2Flibrary%2Fdocuments%2Fbiogas_as_transport_fuel_june06.pdf Biogas composed of 95 percent methane useful as vehicle fuel, can also be used in regular CNG systems]</ref><ref>[http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/maintenance/should-you-convert-your-car-to-natural-gas Compressor used in very similar fuels, ie natural gas for transport]</ref>). It can be compressed to a specific pressure at which methane is still a gas (say 3600 psi for the tank/125psi injected to motor). It can also be compressed untill it becomes a liquid fuel; however at these pressures the fuel has actually consumed more energy for the compression than what it can actually release in work when combusted.<ref>[[http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/MethaneDigesters/MD4.html Journeytoforever on methane for vehicle use]</ref>

==Risks==
If allowed to escape it has a negative impact on the climate. This, as it's a very potent GHG-gas. It breaks down when burned, so not a problem if burned; yet it can be a problem ie in case of leaks. Although it is a potent greenhouse gas, it does not last as long in the atmosphere as many other such gases, eventually breaking down into [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]].
