Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a technology that integrates biomass systems with geological carbon storage. During combustion, fermentation, putrefaction, biodegradation and other biological processes, large amounts of CO2 are emitted from trees, plants and agricultural crops. These processes are for example found in biomass fuelled power plants, pulp and paper industries, ethanol plants and biogas plants.  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/online/27026|title=Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=2011-12-14}}</ref>.
