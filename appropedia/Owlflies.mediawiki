'''Owlflies''' (Ascalaphidae) are large insects, many of which resemble dragonflies (although they are only distantly related to them). The larvae are ambush predators that can be helpful in the garden.

Some species of owlflies prefer to live in the leaf litter where they forage for food.

== Description ==

Owlflies grow to about 3 to 5cm or 1 to 2 inches in length. They have large eyes, a long abdomen and long antennae that end in a small ball or club-like shape. These insects have wings with net-like veins.

The larvae tend to camouflage well and look like leaves, twigs and vegetation. This enables them to lie in wait for their prey.

Adult owlflies eat flying insects. Many species of owlflies will catch the prey while flying themselves.
