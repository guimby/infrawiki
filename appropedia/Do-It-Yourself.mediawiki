â€˜Do it yourself' is an old term and represents the very core of [[sustainable living]]. We deal with [[energy]], [[soils]] and [[agriculture]], [[water]] supplies and [[construction]], all in a do it yourself sense, in other parts of Appropedia. Here we gather together all the other aspects of sustainable living in one section.

Many of these activities have long been seen as mere hobbies but they were once considered as essential human arts and surely will be again. Their present practice is very necessary to keep them alive and well for when they again will be needed. Can you make [[soap]]? Or a pair of shoes? So what will you do if these are no longer easily available?
