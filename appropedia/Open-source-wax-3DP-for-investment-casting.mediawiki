<center>''Wax printing combines the centuries-old processing method of casting and the decades-old processing method of additive manufacturing.''</center>

==Introduction==
This procedure for open-source wax printers is based on work done at MichiganTech with [[Athena_Build_Overview|RepRap derivative printers]] and custom RepRap driver [[Franklin]].

==Safety==

Follow all safety procedures for your printer and the space you are in.

==Equipment or Bill of Materials==

Information about how to construct a delta-based printer can be found [[Athena_Build_Overview|here]].

# 3D printer capable of printing wax
# Printable wax (found from [http://www.machinablewax.com/product.php?product=52 Machinable Wax])
# Glue stick

==Calibration & Tolerances==
Information on how to calibrate a delta-based RepRap printer is found [[Athena_Franklin#Calibration|here]].

==Operation & Procedure==

===Generating g-code===

# Obtain an CAD model of your desired part
## Search 3D model repositories ([https://yeggi.com Yeggi], [https://thingiverse.com Thingiverse], [https://youmagine.com YouMagine]) for existing models
## Design a custom part using CAD software (free and open-source options include [//www.freecadweb.org FreeCAD] and [//www.openscad.org OpenSCAD])
# Slice your model using a slicer (options include [https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software Cura] and [//www.slic3r.org slic3r]) using suggested settings:
## Print speed: 25-40mm/s
## Brim-type adhesion
## 130C
# Save g-code

===Printing===

# Inspect the work area for any potential hazards and ensure equipment is properly hooked up
# Turn on printer and computer and navigate to your printer control software and load g-code to printer (if using Franklin, additional information can be found [[Franklin|here]])
# Apply glue stick to print bed and allow to dry completely
# Press print

===Processing===

# Printed parts can be removed carefully by hand or by gently lifting the edges from the print bed with a razor
# Printed parts can be wax welded to other pieces
# Print lines on the parts can be smoothed with hot utensils

==Shutdown==

# Allow hot end to cool to 50C before shutting off the printer
