==Abstract==
Buckles are very useful and found on a wide variety of items; however, if one breaks, it is hard to find a cheap replacement.  Since buckle sizes vary depending on the application, I made a fully parametric OpenSCAD design.  There are several other buckle designs available, but none of them can be scaled easily; many of the designs found only provide STL files. [[Image:Parametric_Buckle.jpg|500px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# Filament (amount depends on size of buckle)
# Design files (OpenSCAD and STL): [https://www.youmagine.com/designs/parametric-buckle | Youmagine Link] 

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Knowledge of OpenSCAD is needed to manipulate the parametric settings in order to customize the buckle (such as changing the buckle width in the code to match application).

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

# Print Settings
## Male Buckle: 30% infill, 0.2mm layer height, 60mm/s print speed, print with prongs flat on bed. No support needed. Print at 210 degrees Celsius for PLA.
## Female Buckle: 30% infill, 0.2mm layer height, 60mm/s print speed, print flat on bed.  Support recommended for the female casing; use Cura's "everywhere" support feature.  Print at 210 degrees Celsius for PLA.

# Print Times (Varies on size of buckle)
## Male Buckle: 23min
## Female Buckle: 27min
## Overall time: 50min

# Assembly
## Estimated time: ~5-15min. This time accounts for removing supporting structure inside the female component and restitching fabric through the clips.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* The female buckle can be made without supports; however, this results in a buckle that is easily susceptible to wear and tear.  Using Cura's "Everywhere" support feature makes the buckle more robust.
* Make sure to take time to clear the female buckle of support material before trying to use it.  Failure to do so will result in a hard to use buckle.

== Cost savings==
* Cost estimate uses the base STL files on Youmagine.  Varying buckle sizes can result in different costs and savings due to the parametric nature of the project.
# Total cost: $0.46 (20 grams PLA)
# Commercial Part: $0.82 - $6 + S&H [https://www.buckleguy.com/7315-7316-3-4-rock-lockster-plastic-side-release-buckle/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAperBBRDfuMf72sr56fIBEiQAPFXszTH8WvwJFAprRLFIz-q0qukZa3f4yJZZXPIUcj9S6CMaAiF78P8HAQ]
# Minimum savings of $0.36 (43.9% savings)
