A [[solar refrigerator]] has been developed by the [[Appropriate Technology Collaborative]] (ATC). The purpose is for storing vaccines, but it could easily be used for other purposes.

It does not use electricity, but directly uses the sun's heat to run its [[refrigeration]] process.

It has "no moving parts that need maintenance" and it can also run on biofuels.
It is made out of simple, widely-available materials: steel, charcoal and ethanol or methanol.
Being a simple technology, it can be [[made locally]].
