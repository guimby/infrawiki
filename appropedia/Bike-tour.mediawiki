== In a nutshell ==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriate_technology Appropriate technology.] Isn't that something for hippies and [[poverty]]-stricken nations? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source Open source.] Isn't that a strange hobby only relevant to computer nerds?

We don't think so. We're convinced that '''[[appropriate technology]] is just good design and open source is just good practice,''' and that we're not alone; a burgeoning socially and environmentally conscious appropriate technology hacking movement is spreading across the United States.

There are hackers out there, and two young engineers are biking across the United States to find them and tell their stories. Instead of loading up on the newest, slickest commercial gear, they're creating and cobbling together open-license and public domain [[appropriate technologies]] for their water, food, shelter, and even bicycling needs as they tour the country from Boston to Burning Man writing a book on the people and projects they find.

== The bikers ==

'''[[User:Ccarrick|Chris Carrick]]''' is a 22-year-old photographer from Florida who happens to also be a mechanical engineer and appropriate technology enthusiast and hacker.

'''[[User:Mchua|Mel Chua]]''' is a 21-year-old writer from Illinois who happens to also be an electrical and computer engineer and open source programmer and advocate.

We're open to companions for any segment of the ride; contact us if you're interested.
