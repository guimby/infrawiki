Written by Jeffrey Adams:

Design occurs through out our daily practices as well as in our built environment, social institutions, and economic systems. The outcomes and impacts of design activities vary immensely across scales and applications. The following spectrum of design (adapted from a presentation by Andres Edwards) illustrates a range of design frameworks:

Business as Usual – Green – Sustainable - Restorative – Regenerative

(Least positive impact -----------------------------Highest positive impact)

As most/all ecosystems are in decline, and many/most people have been extracted from direct daily connection to the land and means of production upon which their lives depend, the health of people, environment, and economy are degrading and disconnected.  Regenerative design is about the purposeful creation and execution of plans that strengthen and revitalize the natural connection between people and place. Regenerative design seeks to bring about a more harmonious and healthy way of being in the world, as well as the infrastructure and social structure needed to most effectively catalyze and support this relationship. 

Regenerative design applies a whole-systems perspective to form cycles by reconnecting linear applications and integrating aspects once segregated. From a vision of wholeness and abundance, the design of creative solutions and strategies for the re-integration of people and place towards thriving, abundant local economies and ecologies is attainable.
