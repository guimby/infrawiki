==Problem being addressed==
Phototherapy is the most common form of therapy for jaundice in newborns. However, it is difficult to measure the amount of light waves that penetrate the newbornâ€™s skin. In addition, these phototherapy units cost more than $2,000, a cost too high to be utilized in low-resource settings.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This phototherapy light meter allows physicians to determine the effectiveness of phototherapy lights. The light meters allow technicians to identify the amount of light that is given off in the spectrum of visible light. In addition, these meters also have filters that can block interference. In this way, these light meters can be used to validate the irradiance of tube-based phototherapy devices.
