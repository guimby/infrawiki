The '''GardenPool''' is a large run-down pool that was turned into an inexpensive & [[self-sufficient]] urban [[greenhouse]]. Self-sufficiency was achieved in mid-2010, with about 8 fresh [[eggs]] per day, unlimited [[tilapia]] fish, organic [[fruit]], vegetables, and [[herbs]] every day of the year.
