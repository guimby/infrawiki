== Community participation in development ==

In recent years development work has shifted from a [[top-down]] approach to a [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#B|bottom-up]] approach. While sometimes this is rhetoric, there is also a recognition that participation (and preferably initiation) by the community is essential to an effective project. 

This approach is more costly and time-consuming, but is also more cost-effective as it gives much better and longer-lasting results.

==Participatory rural appraisal==

'''Participatory rural appraisal''' is a term describing the incorporation of the knowledge and opinions of rural people in the planning and management of development projects and programs. [[Robert Chambers]], a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies (UK)]],<ref  name="IISD">See the IIDS page [http://www.iisd.org/casl/CASLGuide/PRA.htm Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)].</ref> has written on this topic, and it is described in the World Bank Participation Sourcebook.<ref>[http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sba104.htm Participatory Rural Appraisal. Collaborative Decisionmaking: Community-Based Method]. (From ''[http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sbhome.htm The World Bank Participation Sourcebook], [http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sba1.htm Appendix I: Methods and Tools].''</ref>

The Institute of Development Studies explains that it builds on [[rapid rural appraisal]] (RRA),[http://www.iisd.org/casl/CASLGuide/RapidRuralAppraisal.htm][http://www.fao.org/docrep/W3241E/w3241e09.htm] and highlights five central additional concepts and three dangers and drawbacks.<ref name="IISD"/>
The five central additional concepts are
* Empowerment
* Respect
* Localization
* Enjoyment - the emphasis is no longer on being "rapid" but on the process.
* Inclusiveness

Dangers and drawbacks
* "Hijacking" - being used to create legitimacy for an external party.
* Formalism - an abrupt and exploitative approach is common where there is a deadline to meet.
* Disappointment - when expectations are raised and nothing tangible emerges.

==Three caveats==

Three warnings regarding participation:<ref>based on [http://www.southbound.com.my/communication/parcom.htm Participatory Communication for Development], 2004, citing White, S.A. (1994). "The concept of participation: transforming rhetoric to reality" in White, S.A. et al (1994) Participatory communication: working for change and development. New Delhi, India: Sage Publications. p.18</ref>
*Participation is not a panacea, and does not suit every circumstance. The mother of a child dying of diarrhea does not want to "participate". 
*Beware of manipulation - conscious or unconscious, e.g. when a "participatory social communicator" has preconceived ideas.
*Remember the opportunity cost - villagers do not have endless free time, and may be giving up time on productive work in order to participate.

== Community power in Turkmenistan ==

:<tt>In [[Turkmenistan]]'s Karra Kum desert, one of the themes to emerge from early participatory video work was a strong local desire for electricity to improve people's lifestyles and enable them to stay in the desert. Participatory video is again being used as a tool for documenting the challenges and decision-making processes involved in the community-led installation of solar power within different shepherding villages. The solar panels are neither sold nor given to the communities; instead, villagers decided that each family should exchange one ewe and one female lamb for their solar lighting system - these animals become the collective property of the village and are used as a "community action fund"...</tt><ref>from [http://www.comminit.com The Communication Initiative]'s newsletter, ''Environment & Communication - DB Click'', October 31 2006.
