'''Fire extinguishing''' refers to the extinguishing of a fire. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher#Dry_chemical chemical powder extinguisher] is nowadays used for pretty much any type of fire, however appropriate fire extinguishing assumes analysing the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_classes fire class] first, and then selecting a (environmentally harmless) extinguishing agent. For powder extinguishers, this means using particulate matter (ie sand, soil, ...), and for foam extinguishers, this means using a ecological soap mixed with water. CO² and FM 200 extinguishers can be used as is (already ecological). Both however only work in confined spaces (indoors).

==Appropriate extinguishers depending on fire class==
* Class A: use water, or water + foam
* Class B: use powder, or CO² or FM 200
* Class C: use powder, or CO² or FM 200
* Class D: use powder, or CO² or FM 200

Note: never use water with class B fires, the water can spread the combustible fuel making the fire larger. Foam with water can also not be used with B fires, for the same reason. CO² finally can be used indoors, but make sure not to use it when inside the room (can asphyxiate the user).
