Functional categories simply describe the overall type of a page: is it

* [[:Category:Page Type]]
** [[:Category:Technology]] - Describe a technology and how to apply it
** [[:Category:Best Practice]] - Describe the best way of doing a common task (like, say, digging a latrine)
** [[:Category:Decision Support]] - Describe the differences between options and help a reader choose between them ("which CF bulb is best for me?", "how should I spend my home energy efficiency renovation dollar?")
** [[:Category:Project Homepage]] - The home page of a project hosted here
** [[:Category:Open Question]] - see [[Provisional Research Workflow]]
** [[:Category:Answered Question]] - see [[Provisional Research Workflow]]

I would expect a lot more page types to arise.
