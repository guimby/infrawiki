===16 panel solar array===
* There are 8 panels each of [http://www.nexpw.com/seriesproducts.php?s_id=1 Nexpower] amorphous silicon framed 100W and 8 panels of [http://www.bosch-solarenergy.de/fileadmin/downloads/Datenblaetter/Bosch_Solar_Module___m_Si_plus_englisch.pdf Bosch] unframed micro-morph silicon 100W panels positioned at angles from 0 to 70 degrees from the horizontal in 10 degree increments.
*The panel at 0 degrees can pivot and allows for "dump" tests to determine the critical angle for snow shedding. 
*The short circuit current of the panels is measured by a datalogger to give real time power outputs correlated directly with meteorological and thermal measurements.

===Meteorological sensors===
*Snow sensor- Ultrasonic Snow sensor measures current snow depth. This is the same sensor used by Environment Canada for their snow depth measurements
*Ambient temperature- Radiation Shielded thermometer gives an accurate indication of the ambient temperature
*Wind speed and direction
*Incident solar radiation- Direct and diffuse solar radiation data will be used from a nearby solar laboratory

===Thermal and panel power sensors===
*32 channels of T-type thermocouples measure the temperature at the top and bottom of each panel
*16 channels of shunt wiring measures the voltage drop across a resistor in series with each PV short circuit loop. This gives an accurate measurement of short circuit current.

===Visual observations===
*A outdoor rated digital camera will be mounted nearby and used to take photographs of the array at constant intervals. 
*This will allow for an analysis of the total snow cover, the snow melting patterns over time, as well as the collection of the snow shed beneath a panel.

===Campbell scientific datalogger===
*A stand-alone datalogger running on battery power with a [[Digi-Connect WAN modem for cellular connection of dataloggers| cellular modem for external communications]]
*Monitors meteorological conditions, panel power, and panel temperature through two multiplexers

===Physical measurements===
*Measurements will also be taken by hand at larger intervals on the following parameters
*Snow water equivalent- This is a measure of the relative density of the snow, and will be taken using snow cores. 
*Accumulated precipitation- Measured using a standard rain gauge, will give another measure of the total precipitation between measurements
*Panel snow accumulation- Will measure the height of snow accumulation at the top and bottom of each panel.
