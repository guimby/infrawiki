Daikon radish will make fat white roots that are a favorite grated condiment with Japanese food and a constituent of some Chinese noodle dishes. In the mustard family, it is very vigorous, and it is capable of tilling hardpan (though you will not get the big fat roots you see in the grocery store from growing daikon in hardpan). The yellow flowers are attractive, and the scent is probably agreeable to most people. It is subject to mildew in damp climates, but you just take it down if it starts to look bad. 

Can also be used in [[Kim chee]]

Dried, it is an ingredient in some Thai dishes as well.
