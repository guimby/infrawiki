*Shows high association of risk for lung cancer and cardiopulmonary mortality and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter

*doubling the time of follow-up researchers saw mortality numbers triple due to the causes listed above- relative to other studies

*Provides great picture of fuel cycle- primary and secondary coupled with adverse health effects at each stage

*Electricity considered secondary source of energy as traditionally formed from combustion of fossil fuels

*Factor in household fuel use- such as coal for cooking- indoor air pollution here

*Health effects from fossil fuels span across life cycle: mining to transport to combustion to waste management

*Coal: major energy source: ~25% energy use, ~40% of electrical use, ~40% contribution to climate change through carbon dioxide

*Coal mining dangerous to workers: ~15,000 mining injuries per year, ~3800-6000 premature deaths per year in China (numbers correct have direct source in lit rev)

*Injuries from mining accidents (explosions, floods, falling rocks, misuse of machinery) and respiratory exposures to silica and coal dust, along with risk of lung cancer

*Areas near coal mining operations report higher risk of CVD, pulmonary, kidney diseases

*Once transported for electricity- occupational hazards include:dust and carcinogen exposure

*Combustion: cited as heaviest health burden- double check source- carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, mercury, other metals

*Particulate matter: results in acute and chronic death; no well defined safe threshold for PM

*Small assessment on solar: major health concern is related to the crystalline silicon, other materials such as: copper indium diselenide, copper indium galium diselenide, gallium arsenide, and cadmium telluride

*Mining for silica risk of silicosis (lung disease caused by inhalation), exposure to toxic metals (cadmium, arsenic,chromium, lead) and gases (arsine, phosphine, silane) during manufacturing

*Cited that health impacts of solar are far less than any fossil fuel
