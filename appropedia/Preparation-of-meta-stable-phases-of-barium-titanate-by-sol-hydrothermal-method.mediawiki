==Abstract==
[[image:BaTiO3.jpg|right]]
Two low-cost chemical methods of sol–gel and the hydrothermal process have been strategically combined to fabricate barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) nanopowders. This method was tested for various synthesis temperatures (100 <sup>°</sup>C to 250 <sup>°</sup>C) employing barium dichloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) as precursors and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as mineralizer for synthesis of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanopowders. The as-prepared BaTiO<sub>3</sub> powders were investigated for structural characteristics using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The overall analysis indicates that the hydrothermal conditions create a gentle environment to promote the formation of crystalline phase directly from amorphous phase at the very low processing temperatures investigated. XRD analysis showed phase transitions from cubic - tetragonal - orthorhombic - rhombohedral with increasing synthesis temperature and calculated grain sizes were 34 – 38 nm (using the Scherrer formula). SEM and TEM analysis verified that the BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanopowders synthesized by this method were spherical in shape and about 114 - 170 nm in size. The particle distribution in both SEM and TEM shows that as the reaction temperature increases from 100 <sup>°</sup>C to 250 <sup>°</sup>C, the particles agglomerate. Selective area electron diffraction (SAED) shows that the particles are crystalline in nature. The study shows that choosing suitable precursor and optimizing pressure and temperature; different meta-stable (ferroelectric) phases of undoped BaTiO<sub>3</sub> nanopowders can be stabilized by the sol-hydrothermal method.
