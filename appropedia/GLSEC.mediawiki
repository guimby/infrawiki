= Overview =
Great Lakes Sustainable Energy Consortium

The Syracuse Center of Excellence, along with its academic and industry partners (Cornell, Syracuse, SUNY ESF, Clarkson) have joined in partnership with their Canadian academic colleagues (Queens, Royal Military College, University of Ottawa) and industry, under the auspices of Great Lakes Sustainable Energy Consortium [GLSEC], to pursue collaborations that will benefit technical research, public policy options and implementation, and commercial developments on both sides of the border, along the I-81 Corridor through Central NY and Eastern Ontario.  It is anticipated that this effort will broaden to include a wider Great Lakes basin focus in time.  

The objectives of the GLSEC are: (i) the establishment of a world-class Canada-US research and public policy consortia focussing on [[renewable energy]] research and policy implementation; (ii) graduate research student, faculty, and industry technical collaboration, policy implementation and economic development; (iii) increased understanding of Canada and US renewable energy research and public policy options; (iv) stimulate coordinated renewable energy policy between Ontario and NYS; (v) the establishment of an annual technical and policy briefing on the state of renewable energy research, policy implications and commercial implementation for both Ontario and NYS.  

The planned activities  of the GLSEC are as follows: (i) Canadian and American academic and industry researchers affiliated with GLSEC will meet to discuss and advance research innovations and public policy regulatory/legislative challenges related to sustainable energy resources, during a workshop planned for Fall 2009; subsequently (ii) a meeting/conference of key researchers, industry and commerce leaders and policy specialists from both Canada and the United States will work together to develop a white paper on regional (binational) sustainable energy innovations, implementation pathways, and policy implications; (iii) this white paper will form the basis of a planned briefing at the highest levels of the Government of the State of New York and the Province of Ontario (i.e. Governor Paterson and Premier McGuinty).  It is anticipated that this briefing will become an annual event with both Canadian and American participants.

The expected results of the GLSEC are: (i) an increase in cross-border research collaboration between and amongst engineering and public policy faculty and graduate students; (ii) cross-border collaborative research funding proposals directed toward USDOE, USDA, USDOD, NRCan, NRC, AAFC; (iii) the establishment of an ongoing annual cross-border renewable energy workshop focused on technical and policy issues and challenges; (iv) a coordinated NYS response to Ontario Power Generation's Request for Expressions of Interest regarding Biomass Fuel and Transportation; (v) development of collaborative Canada-US policy research between Queen's School of Public Policy and the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, allowing for binational energy and environmental policy discussion venue for policy decision-makers in Ottawa and Washington, DC.

= Research Focus =
Integration of both technology and policy to create a sustainable energy system in the Lake Ontario region. This renewable energy region will act as a template for other regions both across Canada and the U.S.

 We must address: Security of Supply, Environmental Impact and Economic Sustainability

== Research Questions ==
* What is the energy portfolio (technology etc) we need for tomorrow
* Growth rate for technologies can cannibalize energy produced to fabricate future energy plants (Joshua P. nuclear example -see [http://www.climate2008.net/?a1=pap&cat=1&e=61 Limitations of Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Technologies Set by Rapid Growth and Energy Cannibalism]) 
* Could optimize for jobs? What gives the best return?
* There are different ways to optimize
* The OPG Request for Interest & disruptive decisions (the 1.5 million tonne per year question!)

== Potential Funding ==
Helping each other from the other side of the border.

* White papers help to drive the areas of interest I a future funding call
* We should focus on jobs, not just technology in any given region; this gives rise to public policy issues: What should we be building and what/where should dollars be directed for that infrastructure
* Use as reference the format from “Summary for Policy Makers” – IPCC report

= Proposed Conferences/Meetings =
# GLSECForum - Public Policy day 1 Sets Big picture for meeting - Tech drivers for day 2

* Hold in Albany -- ‘Taking the Bacon home to the diner” - Albany – link 1) with briefing at governor's office
* Toronto/Kingston - Creative Corridor between Albany and Kingston!
* A regular forum

'''Let’s get 1) going (Informal, TIM-like mtg) & begin planning for 2) (Formal-type similar to CoE or QU June 2008 mtg on Biomass and Energy for the Great Lakes Economy)'''

* Healthy Bldgs Mtg & Exhibition Syracuse Sept 13-17 2009 w 1200 people

* 15 + 5 min + Posters for meeting (1) (informal)

== Background Idea ==
The proposed '''1000 Island Energy Research Forum (TIERF) - please note the name is being determined below''' draws on the traditions of the quarter century old '''1000 Island Fluids Conference''': a non-threatening arena for graduate students to present their research results, at whatever stage, to their peers and seasoned academic researchers.  The meeting is non-sponsored, is held in an informal setting and has no registration fee. It is affordable for students to pay their own way (typically, two nights accommodation and 6 meals cost about $300, including a “experimental two phase flow fluids session” on Saturday evening, paid for through “voluntary contributions”; that is, marbles are distributed at the pleasure of each session chair for such things as too many equations, referring to funding agencies, and worst of all, referring to your academic supervisors as Prof or Dr.).

The format is no parallel sessions with talks being either 8 or 15 minutes in length to enable even first year graduate students to gain practice speaking in a public forum.

The planning group may decide that the above is too informal, especially if industry is expected to attend.

== Meeting Details ==
<center> “Bright people getting together to work on hard problems on sustainable energy”</center>
