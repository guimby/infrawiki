==Engineers Without Borders Australia partners with Appropedia==
*http://www.ewb.org.au/newsletter/?nid=118

==Pages relevant to EWB Australia campaigns==
*[[Low cost computer guide]] - useful info, but could do with a lot of work from those with experience in [[ICT4D]]. Hopefully this will merge well with Ram's material from the ICT4D wiki. 
*[[Global warming]] (focusing on practical solutions) and pages in that category: 
**[[Greenhouse gas emissions]]
**[[Incentives to pollute]]
**[[Measures to stop global warming]]

Please note that as of 23 March 2007, all the Global warming content on those pages has been developed by one person - so please contribute as you're able!
