[[==level 1==Introduction]]
The UN released an update report in November 2013 to show the status of the Millennium Development Goals in Iraq. 

[[===level 2=== Background]]
The UN made the following Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to achieve by 2015:
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development
Though these weren't fully completed, progress has been made. 

[[====level 3==== Status of MDGs in Iraq]]
In 2013 almost 94% of the Iraqi population had access to improved sanitation and sewage, but almost 30% of them had no access to properly sanitized drinking water. A report on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set to be completed within the country by 2015 will be published soon. For a large percentage of Iraqis, gathering water involves walking far to find water. Improved infrastructure will help to make water more accessible. The United Nations is currently working with Iraq to align the country with sustainable practices.
