==Background==
The Practivistas Domincana Program is currently a program involving [[Humboldt State University]] and UNIBE that takes place in Santo Domingo, Domincan Republic. The rainwater catchment system in La Yuca in Santo Domingo was [[La Yuca rainwater catchment|first constructed in 2011]]. The water from this system was used for washing but was not potable. In 2012 the system was [[La Yuca rainwater catchment 2012|reconstructed]] and had different filters added in order to make the water potable. In the beginning of the summer of 2013, the water is still being used for washing but the water available for drinking is not being filtered, and therefore, it is not being used.

==Objective==
During the 2013 [[Practivistas Dominicana Program]] the objective is to make the La Yuca rainwater catchment system potable as well as easily accessible.

==Literature Review==
Here is the [[La Yuca rainwater catchment 2013/Literature Review|link]] for the information gathered to review and learn what is necessary to understand the concepts of design and implementation of rainwater catchment systems in the Dominican Republic.

== Final Design ==
The director of the school in La Yuca wanted to have potable water in the bathroom and a direct faucet to the cistern. Taking into consideration the director's desires, the final design was constructed to have potable water in the shower sink and greywater use for the toilet.

===Maintenance===
This final design requires consistent upkeep in order to reduce the amount of contaminants.<br />
''Periodically OR Every Few Rainfalls''
*First Flush holes should be checked for blockage
''Every Month''
*Primary screening must be checked for damage or clogging
*1/4 cup of chlorine must be added per 1000 gallons
''Every Year''
*First Flush must be thoroughly cleaned
*Tinaco (or storage tank) must be emptied of sediment and disinfected
*Sediment and Carbon filters must be replaced

==Timeline==
'''June 10th 2013'''
*Discussed plan of action
-Find water testing kits
-Discuss what is wrong with the current configuration
-Figure out questions to ask Aswaldo (Disassemble? Maintenance?)
*Found out UNIBE does not have any water testing kits.<br/>
*UNIBE normally has a professor take water samples to USAD (809)535-8273<br/>
*An alternative location for water testing is CAASD<br/>

'''June 11th 2013'''
*Email with contact information of USAD water lab was recived.

*Received results from Puradom of the current water qualtity. Test results indicated that the water was not potable.
Reasons for water quality failure are as follows<br />
-Not enough bleach was added to the system<br />
-The bleach was not allowed to sit in the water for 4-5 hours before we tested for water quality<br />
-We did not wait long enough for contaminated water to clear and the bleach water to come through<br />
-Due to limited amounts of water, the cleaning and testing process was rushed
