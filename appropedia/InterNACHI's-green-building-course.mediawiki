=InterNACHI's Green Building Course=

InterNACHI has released an online [[Green building]] course.  This course is designed to educate inspectors about what green building is, why itâ€™s important and how to recognize [[green systems]] and features in homes.  It addresses the three main aspects of green building:
* [[energy efficiency]], 
* [[sustainable materials]] and [[sustainable practices]] and 
* healthy homes.  

This course, developed by InterNACHI member Kenton Shepard, helps teach inspectors to be safe during a home inspection.  In keeping with InterNACHI's commitment to continuing education, '''this course is free to all, open to all and can be taken again and again without limit'''.
 
Members will need their username and password.  Non-members are welcome to take the course at no charge as well and can acquire a password at the first [http://www.education.nachi.org/show.php?course_id=34 page of the course].

InterNACHI asks that everyone send their comments and suggested additions to  help them improve it. Please contribute by emailing fastreply@nachi.org.
