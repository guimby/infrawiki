Many volunteers will be needed for and in advance of OSNCon!  We're still seeking volunteers to coordinate and plan for volunteers!

We are looking for help in these areas:
* Help in advance of the conference
** Planning lunch (this includes finding a lunch sponsor)
** Designing t-shirt, managing the printing and ordering (this needs to be done asap)
** going through our [[OSNCamp 2008/Invite|invite list]] and inviting people and organizations
*** Developing help on accommodations and alternatives
*** [[OSNCon/carpool|carpool]] support?
*** suggesting useful resources for an SF-based conference
* Help at the conference itself
** Volunteers to help attendees generally ("volunteer concierges")
** Help with lunch logistics
** Help with t-shirts
** Help accepting donations to support 

Please [[OSNCon/Contact|Contact Us]] if you are able to chip in to make OSNCon 2008 a success!  Thank you!
