'''Plasma arc gasification''' is a [[technology]] that takes waste and then gasifies it using a plasma arc at somewhere around 6000-12000 degrees F. The products left over are then a [[glass]] like [[slag]] and [[syngas]]. 

This technology seems to produce few if any dangerous pollutants and appears to be many times cleaner than regular incineration technology.
