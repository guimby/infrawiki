'''Industrial organic agriculture''' is method of [[agriculture]] which combines  aspects of [[conventional agriculture]] with [[organic agriculture|organic production methods]].

==Approach==
Industrial organic farmers generally target national and international markets. When organic companies try to meet the demand of big chains like Whole Foods, they start looking a lot like conventional farms minus the herbicide and pesticide.  Throughout some organic farms, the fields look as weed-free as those treated with herbicides.  In order to achieve that look, organic farms must till the land more.  This leads to a reduction in the soilâ€™s biological activity, promotes topsoil erosion, increases water loss and contributes to a long list of other environmental concerns.  Industrial farming such as this is not much more environmentally friendly than conventional industrial farming. Industrial organic farming often uses up to 1/3 more fossil fuel than small scale organic methods (Glazer 2007).
