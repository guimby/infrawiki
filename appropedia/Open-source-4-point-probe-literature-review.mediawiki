a description of the electronics used for measurents is given in [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ejssnt/1/0/1_0_50/_article this paper].

===An AC Bridge for Semiconductor Resistivity Measurements Using a Four-Point Probe===

M. A. Logan, "[https://archive.org/details/bstj40-3-885 An AC bridge for semiconductor resistivity measurements using a four-point probe]," ''Bell System Technical Journal, The'', 40(3), 885-919, 1961.

*describes a measurement circuit that measures the ratio between voltage and current of a 4PP, and thus the resistivity
**'''60's era analog magic'''
**built-in calibration
*describes a system that's entirely grounded, ac operated, and devoid of meters save for an ac null detector
**constant current source is unnecessary
**independent of frequency
*precision amplifiers are necessary
*describes steps that need to be taken for various resistivity levels
*goes into the effect of constriction resistance
*'''is sensitive to probe contact resistance'''
*thermal noise and parasitic probe capacitance is accounted for

*'''in-depth discussion of 4PP electronics'''
*uses System-on-a-Chip's (SoC) to simplify design
*a microcontroller is used to produce the current via control of a DAC (with feedback from the ADC)
*a fluke voltmeter is used to measure voltages
**this is used to calibrate the DAC as well as measure inner terminal voltage

==Commercial Review==

I'm focusing on devices with similar capabilities to the device being planned
*resistivity measurement capabilities
*automatic measurement at a large amount of programmable points
*support for at least 300mm wafers
