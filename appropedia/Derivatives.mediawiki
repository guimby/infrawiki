'''Derivatives''' are creative works or knowledge works which use the work of another author or authors, adapting it (slightly or radically) to make a new work.

The [[No derivatives clause]] in a license denies this right, and such a license does not qualify as an "[[open license]]" (also called "[[free license]]").
