'''Burning Man''' is held in harsh conditions, and also aims to have zero impact on the local environment (though there is of course the impact of many people driving there - so share transport if you can!)

This can be a great time to experiment with and get the benefits of [[appropriate technology]], such as the [[Hexayurt playa]] and [[Burning Man Evaporative Cooler]].

See [[Burning Man Cabal]] if you're interested in joining an Appropedia-themed group (which needs a better name) for Burning Man 2008.

Photos of the very creative living structures and a description of some of the issues involved in surviving the Burning Man festival are described in the thesis
