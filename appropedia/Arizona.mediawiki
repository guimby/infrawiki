=== Cycling activism ===

Wikipedia: 

:[[wikipedia:Tucson,_Arizona#Cycling|Tucson]]: Cycling is popular in Tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate. Tucson and Pima County maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes, signal crossings, on-street bike lanes, dedicated shared-use paths, and mountain-biking trails. The Tucson-Pima County Bicycle Advisory Committee (TPCBAC) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation, transportation, and safety. Tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by the League of American Bicyclists in 2006.

:[[wikipedia:Arcosanti|Arcosanti]] is an experimental town and molten bronze bell casting community in Yavapai County, central Arizona, 70 mi (110 km) north of Phoenix, at an elevation of 3,732 feet (1,130 meters). Its Arcology concepts were developed by the Italian-American architect, Paolo Soleri (1919-2013). He began construction in 1970, to demonstrate how urban conditions could be improved while minimizing the destructive impact on the earth. He taught and influenced generations of architects and urban designers who studied and worked with him there to build the town.
