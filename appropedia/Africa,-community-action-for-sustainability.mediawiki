Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. {{W|Africa}}

== Environmental issues in Africa ==

Environmental issues in Africa are caused by anthropogenic effects on the African natural environment and have major impacts on humans and nearly all forms of endemic life. Issues include desertification, problems with access to safe water supply, population explosion and fauna depletion. These issues are ultimately linked to over-population in Africa, as well as on a global scale. Nearly all of Africa's environmental problems are geographically variable and human induced, though not necessarily by Africans. {{W|Environmental Issues in Africa}}

=== Deforestation in Africa ===

Africa is suffering deforestation at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Some sources claim that deforestation has already wiped out roughly 90% of West Africa's original forests. Deforestation is accelerating in Central Africa. According to the FAO, Africa lost the highest percentage of tropical forests of any continent during the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. According to the figures from the FAO (1997), only 22.8% of West Africa's moist forests remain, much of this degraded. [[Nigeria]] has lost 81% of its old-growth forests in just 15 years (1990–2005). Massive deforestation threatens food security in some African countries. One factor contributing to the continent's high rates of deforestation is the dependence of 90% of its population on wood as fuel for heating and cooking.

Research carried out by WWF International in 2006 shows that in Africa, rates of illegal logging vary from 50% in [[Cameroon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]] to 70% in [[Gabon]] and 80% in [[Liberia]] – where timber revenues played a major role in financing the [[Sierra Leone]] Civil War and other regional armed conflicts until the UN Security Council imposed a ban on all Liberian timber in 2003. {{W|Deforestation by region#Africa}}

Please see our national pages via the [[:category:Africa|Africa]] category, where of course you can share any more information you may have about local sustainability initiatives.

== Initiatives by topic ==

=== Biodiversity ===

[http://www.savetheserengeti.org/ Serengeti Watch]

Africa has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threatens biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems. {{W|Africa#Biodiversity}}

[http://www.greenpop.org/ Greenpop], social enterprise that runs urban greening and reforestation projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

The '''Great Green Wall''' or Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative (French: Grande Muraille Verte pour le Sahara et le Sahel) is a planned project to plant a wall of trees across Africa at the southern edge of the Sahara desert as a means to prevent desertification. It was developed by the African Union to address the detrimental social, economic and environmental impacts of land degradation and desertification in the Sahel and the Sahara.

=== Urban sustainability ===

Africa now has 350 million urban dwellers, more than the populations of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] combined. [[Asia]] and Africa are expected to double their urban populations to roughly 3.4 billion by 2030. <ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/4840 Worldwatch Institute], 2007 </ref>

Extensive forest fires are affecting several of Kenya's key moisture reservoirs including the 400,000-hectare Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest forest and the source of water for at least twelve rivers. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=573&ArticleID=6109&l=en&t=long United Nations Environment Programme]</ref> March 25. Important Rift Valley Lakes, including Lake Victoria, the source of the River Nile, depend on the rivers which are fed from the forest.
