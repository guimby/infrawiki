Permeable pavement can be used as a substitute for concrete and asphalt driveways, patios, parking lots, or wherever conventional pavements are used. 

By combining hard surface with porous surface, e.g. in a grid pattern, it allows water to be absorbed by the ground, decreasing off-site water runoff.
