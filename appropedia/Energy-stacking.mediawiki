''Note - "Energy stacking" isn't usually used with this meaning. Is there a better term?''


'''Energy stacking''' refers to planning your spreading your use of energy (ie from heavy energy appliances (as dishwasher, washing machine, clothes dryer, ...) throughout the day, in a house fitted with [[off-grid]] power generation. Often energy stacking is essential as the energy storage system you have may have too small a peak output or overall energy capacity to to allow running several heavy energy appliances at a same time, or around a same time during that day (ie restrictions in peak output, or simply overall energy capacity; note for the latter a significant time may need to be kept in between for charging). 

==Benefits==
Energy stacking allows a house to be fitted with a energy storage system with a relatively small capacity. If energy stacking is not practiced, a energy storage system with a much larger peak output and capacity is needed, increasing the cost and increasing your environmental impact (atleast if you wish to generate power completely off grid, so without a [[Net metering|hookup to the mains electricity grid]].
