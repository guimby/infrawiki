== Can a collapse of global civilization be avoided?==

==Abstract==
Environmental problems have contributed to numerous collapses of civilizations in the past. Now, for the first time, a global        collapse appears likely. Overpopulation, overconsumption by the rich and poor choices of technologies are major drivers; dramatic     cultural change provides the main hope of averting calamity.
