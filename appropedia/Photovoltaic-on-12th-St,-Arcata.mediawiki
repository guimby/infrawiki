On site Photovoltaic on 12st, Arcata Presentation by Daniel Titman 

This is a grid tied crystal panel PV system which was installed in 2004. There is no battery backup for a grid tied system. When the PV array is no longer receiving sun light, conventional energy from a local energy provider can be used. The home owners received $8,700 in tax credits/ rebates at the time of installation. Depending on latitude location the panels should have less degree tilt at lower latitudes and greater degree tilt at higher latitudes.

;The following data is from an interview with Daniel Titman 

*Adjustable panels are not worth the time or money to put in place in Humboldt County.
*AC PV panels can be plugged directly into Romex (standard household wiring) 
*The price of the panels reduced from $7-8 per watt down to $3-4 per watt over the last two years. 
*A bigger inverter would be needed if a battery backup was in place. 
*A 4x8 panel cost $800-900 dollars. 

;System overview: 

*3.2 Kilowatt 
*16 panels
