[http://iddsummit.org IDDS] (International Development Design Summit) is a collaboration of people with a wide variety of backgrounds: students, mechanics, social workers, doctors, carpenters, farmers, and professors.  This year we have 58 participants from more than 20 countries. During IDDS, they join forces to build technologies to improve the quality of life in the developing world at [http://web.mit.edu/d-lab D-Lab].   The summit is headed by MIT Senior Lecturer and MacArthur "Genius" Fellow Amy Smith, and is organized by [http://www.mit.edu MIT], [http://www.olin.edu Olin], and [http://www.cooperperkins.com/ Cooper Perkins]  and runs for a four week period in over the months of July and August every year.

Participants are divided into teams and attempt to design technologies that address problems in sectors such as energy, water, agriculture and health. The teams are coached by mentors and guest speakers and then showcase their prototypes in the final week of the summit.  These prototypes are described in the pages categorized below.  Please explore the content to learn more about the accomplishments at IDDS.
