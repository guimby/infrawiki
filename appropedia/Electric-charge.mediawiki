There are only two types of electric charge (positive and negative). These charges are equal in size, but different in character. They are denoted as positive and negative. A charge exist between any two objects that have a net charge. 

With electric charges, like charges repel each other, and unlike charges attract each other. 

The unit of charge is called a Coulomb. The protons have a positive charge, while the electrons have a negative charge. The protons positive charge is equal in size to the electrons. 

* 1 coulomb is equal to 6.25*10^18 electrons. 


All neutral atoms have the same number of electrons and protons.
