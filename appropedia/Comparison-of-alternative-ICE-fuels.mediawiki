| align="left" | [[Compressed air]]
| style="background:#90ffff"|Emissionless 
| ?W/m³
| no land required, only air and accessibility of energy needed
| easy, only possible with certain IC engines such as quasiturbine. Other engines can (supposedly) not be converted
| long storability
| not toxic
| Compressed air works more or less as a energy storage, meaning that you need a fair amount of power first to convert to compressed air. Best option if you have a quasiturbine-engine

| style="background:#ffddaa"|Yes. ?co²
| ?W/m³
| fossil fuels not producible at home, accessibility of water and energy needed
| easy, by DIY method or by kit
| relative long storage of fossil fuels (several months), hydrogen/oxyhydrogen is made just before use
| toxic
| Though ICE conversion is easy and relatively cheap to do, the use of the fossil fuels still makes mixture non-self producible and still polluting. Therefore a full hydrogen/oxyhydrogen is always preferred.

| align="left" | [[Wood gas]]
| style="background:#ffddaa"|Yes. ?co²
| ?W/m³
| producible at home, accessibility of trees needed
| moderate to hard, by DIY method or by kit
| wood stores a long time, wood gas is made just before use
| ?
| Generally quite inefficient, as a lot of heat needs to be generated first to convert the wood into wood gas; however the extra heat might be beneficial to the process too (expands the wood gas), which would mean that not all excess heat is wasted. Perhaps usable for eco-projects as trees may clear area of possible pollution and as emissions may be directed underground with stationary engines using [[Carbon capture and storage]].

| intermediate to hard, depends on whether DIY or by kit
| ?
| though ethanol is safe, methanol is very toxic: avoid inhalation, skin contact, ... Butanol is ?
| although ICE conversion is very easy, ethanol and methanol demand much work to produce (biobutanol can be made easily though). Only second-generation alcohols should be used.

| intermediate to hard, can be outsourced to professional
| ?
| ?
| access to underground natural gas reserves are mostly not available, CNG/HCNG may not be worth the conversion due to still fair amounts of pollution. Methane can be produced cleanly (depends on production method). Biogas can be produced very easily and (relatively) clean using [[biodigester]]s. If any of the mentioned gases are leaked without being burned, it can be very harmful<ref>Methane is a very potent GhG-gas, see http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/because-of-methane-leaks-natural-gas-could-be-as-bad-as-oil-coal.html</ref>.

| ?W/m³
| arable land required, planted with trees for wood
| intermediate, somewhat harder than ethanol/methanol, ... The IC engine used needs to be a Diesel engine
| ?
| not toxic
| relative amount of work needed to produce the fuel. Perhaps usable for eco-projects as trees
may clear area of possible pollution and as emissions may be directed underground with stationary engines using [[Carbon capture and storage]]. Also usable for project combating desertification as japtropha can thrive in sandy/arid environments and as the emissions may again be directed underground (see above)

| Probably much work to produce base fuel itself. Advanced algae production units are very expensive. Pond units are cheap yet very inefficient. Perhaps usable for eco-projects as algae
may clear a seawater area of possible pollution and as emissions may be directed underground with stationary engines using [[Carbon capture and storage]].

==Oxidizers to look into==
[[nitric oxide]] (reported most stable of the NO's), [[nitrogen trioxide]], [[nitrogen pentoxide]] need to be looked into and added if useful.
