== Why ==
=== Context ===

Author Vinay Gupta, of [http://hexayurt.com/ hexayurt] fame, created a Vital Systems Mapping scheme, centered around the 6 broad ways people can die in a catastrophe.  These 6 ways are being too hot or too cold, hunger or thirst, internal disease or external injury.  Food matters for all 6 ways.  For "hunger" and "thirst" the relationship is direct.  Some food gives shade, shelter and fuel which are good to fight "too hot" and "too cold".  Looking at "disease", food gives nutrition and farmacy, and appropriate waste treatment is good for people's health.  Finally, looking at "injury", food gives shelter and more importantly one less reason to fight each other.

* Food just grows vs Food systems are ill
** Globalised
*** External dependency
*** Just In Time = No Stocks
*** Economic efficiency = No Redundancy
*** Cheap food != Good for you
** Outcome
*** [[Poverty]]
*** Bad health
*** Supply risk
* Levels from individual to global
** Individual, household, town (50% FAO?) < 10 km (walk, bike)
** Region (25% FAO?) < 100 km (car, truck)
** World (25% or less FAO?) > 100 km (boats, trains, planes)

=== Aim ===
* Food: 2000 cal/person-day
* Water: 15 liters/person-day
* Irrigation: 100 liters/person-day?
