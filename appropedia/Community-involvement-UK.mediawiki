*In This Together, 11 July 2011, [http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/in-this-together neweconomics.org], tells the stories of people who are improving public services by working with the people who use them and delivering public services in a radically different way. It describes a range of practical projects and includes personal testimonies from individuals directly involved. These examples have at their heart equal and reciprocal relationships between professionals, people using services, their families and neighbours – an approach known as ‘co-production’.
