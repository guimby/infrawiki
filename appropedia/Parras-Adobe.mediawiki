*'''What is Available:''' Adobe Supplies-Clay dirt and the Adobero
*'''Location:''' It is at the old Winery del Marquez de Aguayo.  To get there take Allende Street and go past the Ing de la O Street and go right.  You will see something like a huge castle made of rocks. If you get lost just ask someone where the "Antiguas Bodegas del Marquez de Aguayo" is and they will point you in the right direction.
*'''Notes:''' There is a man that looks over this old winery that is now shut down.  His name is Don Luis Enriques.  He makes adobe and also sells and can get the clay dirt to make it.  His phone number is: 044 842 101 4097.  A truck of the clay dirt needed to make the adobe that is 6 square meters will cost 200-300 pesos.  You just need to call him or go there and coordinate where the dirt needs to go.  He also sells already made adobe bricks if wanted. He can also get rocks to build with which cost 2-5 pesos each.
