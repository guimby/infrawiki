A term that is jokingly meant to try and describe saved [[electricity]] that by means of [[energy efficiency]] was not created, used or wasted. It is not yet a real physical amount or a measureable quantity, simply an attempt to popularize the thinking that saving [[electricity]] and making efficiency-efforts more fun and useful.

The potential in [[energy efficiency]] efforts in U.S. of reducing peak demand on electriciy is possibly as large as 60 [[Nuclear_Power_Plants]] of the infamous Chernobyl-sized plant.[http://www.ccnr.org/amory.html#light] (1989)

Compare this idea with the popular Benjamin Franklin quote:
A penny saved is a penny earned[http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/penny+saved+is+a+penny+earned]
