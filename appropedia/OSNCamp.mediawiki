An '''OSNCamp''' is an informal gathering of people interested in the [[Open Sustainability Network]].

They may be in the form of a [[BarCamp]], a participatory conference with an emphasis on freedom and networking. Shorter events, called MiniBarCamps (up to half a day) are possible as the next OSN events.

== Future events ==
Future events depend on interest, but here are some ideas for late 2008/early 2009:

* [[OSNCamp London]]
:* A possible mini BarCamp in late 2008 (after the 13th?) (This would be an informal half day or evening gathering); 
:* There is talk of a more serious event in early 2009.
* [[OSNCamp East Coast]] - Boston, or somewhere in the North Eastern USA. 
* [[OSNCamp California]]. Probably in the Bay Area again. A lot of people didn't find out about the last one, and would be very interested in attending a new one, perhaps 6 months after the first? (This would be mid-April 2009).
* [[OSNCamp SoCal]] - Southern California. (Alexander Tran is interested).

== Past events ==
* [[OSNCamp 2008]] - the first OSNCamp, in San Francisco
