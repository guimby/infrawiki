Carrying aids allow safer and easier (than head loading or hand carrying)<br /> carrying of cargo by people.<br />
Carrying aids include packframes, the chee-ke, and carrying yokes.<br />
The packframe uses shoulder straps and a hip belt to transfer weight.<br />
The chee-ke is a Korean pack frame with wheels. It is pulled as a handcart<br /> on smooth surfaces and carried in rough terrain.<br />
A carrying yoke transfers the weight to the shoulders. Often cargo is<br /> carried in buckets with the carrying yoke. Two people with carrying<br /> yokes can carry a litter/stretcher holding an injured person or bulky<br /> materials like corn stalks. A carrying yoke can be carved from a log, made<br /> from a board, or made from bamboo and webbing or rope.<br />
