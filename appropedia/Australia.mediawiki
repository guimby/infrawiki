=== Biodiversity ===

Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Conservation in Australia|Conservation in Australia]]: Conservation in Australia is an issue of state and federal policy. Australia is one of the most biologically diverse countries in the world [citation needed], with a large portion of species endemic to Australia. Preserving this wealth of biodiversity is important for future generations.

:Animal habitats like reefs and forests must be preserved in order to preserve population and diversity of animal species. Conservation is vital for future study and for field research to be undertaken, and because biological richness is an unmeasurable aesthetic that may be developed into commercial recreational attractions.

:According to Janine Benyus, the potential for advances in biomimicry in Australia are great because the extreme weather and conditions found here provide an excellent evolutionary incubator. Research on natural processes can only occur if habitat is preserved and organisms continue to thrive. Rainforests such as the Daintree have immeasurable value.

:Federal and State governments manage protected areas and national parks; a number of non-governmental organizations are also involved in conservation.

=== Climate action ===

The per-capita carbon footprint in Australia was rated 12th in the world by PNAS in 2011.

In 2013, the CSIRO released a report stating Australia is getting hotter. In 2014, the Bureau of Meteorology released a report on the state of Australia's climate, which highlighted several key points, including the dramatic increase in Australia's temperatures (particularly nighttime temperatures) and the increasing frequency of bush fires, droughts and floods which have all been linked to [[climate change]]. <ref>[[wikipedia:Climate change in Australia]]</ref>

'''Campaigns''': [http://www.t10.net.au/ The Transition Decade] ([[wikipedia:The Transition Decade|Wikipedia]]): non-partisan shared campaign which is coordinated by an alliance of Australian community, social, and environmental groups, non-profits and NGO's. The initiative forms a unified plan to campaign, lobby and work to restore safe climate conditions and a sustainable future.

=== Coasts ===

One of the notable issues with marine conservation in Australia is the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef's environmental pressures include water quality from runoff, climate change and mass coral bleaching, cyclic outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish, overfishing, and shipping accidents. <ref>[[wikipedia:Environmental issues in Australia#Marine conservation]]</ref>

=== Environment quality ===

[http://www.cleanupaustraliaday.org.au/ Clean Up Australia], ([[wikipedia:Clean Up Australia|Wikipedia]]): Clean Up Australia Limited is a not-for-profit Australian environmental conservation organisation founded by Australian Ian Kiernan, and co-founder Kim McKay, in 1989. It works to foster relationships between the community, business and government to address the environmental issues of waste, water and climate change. Since its inception, Clean Up Australia has grown to include other projects and campaigns including Business Clean Up Day, Schools Clean Up Day, Clean Up the Alps, Clean Up the Kimberley and Clean Up the World. The organisation is behind Clean Up Australia Day, as well as other environmental projects and campaigns. 

=== Ethical consumerism ===

=== Sharing ===

=== Social inclusion ===

Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Homelessness in Australia|Homelessness in Australia]]: The majority of long term homeless people are found in the large cities of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], Perth, and Brisbane. It is estimated that on any given night approximately 105,000 people will be homeless.

:[[wikipedia:Poverty in Australia|Poverty in Australia]]: Some of the latest information on poverty in Australia comes from a study conducted by the Australian Council of Social Service in 2012. The Report, Poverty In Australia, shows that in 2010, after taking account of housing costs, an estimated 2,265,000 people or 12.5% of all people, including 575,000 children (17.3% of all children), lived in households below the most austere poverty line widely used in international research.

=== Sustainable transport activism ===

Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Better_Place#Australia|Better Place#Australia]], [[wikipedia:Environmental impact of transport in Australia|Environmental impact of transport in Australia]], [[wikipedia:Transport_in_Australia#Public_transport_in_Australia|Public transport in Australia]]

=== Trees, woodland and forest ===

Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Forests of Australia|Forests of Australia]]: Australia has many forests of importance due to significant features, despite being one of the driest continents. Australia has approximately 147 million hectares of native forest, which represents some 19% of land use. The majority of Australia's trees are hardwoods, typically eucalypts, rather than softwoods like pine.

=== Urban sustainability ===

Australia is one of the most urbanized countries in the world. Many Australian cities have large urban footprints and are characterised by an unsustainable low density urban sprawl. This places demand on infrastructure and services which contributes to the problems of land clearing, pollution, transport related emissions, energy consumption, invasive species, automobile dependency and urban heat islands.

The urban sprawl continues to increase at a rapid rate in most Australian cities, particularly the state capital cities, all of which (with the exception of Hobart) are metropoleis. In some centres, such as Sydney and Greater Western Sydney, Greater Melbourne and South East Queensland large metropolitan conurbations threaten to extend for hundreds of kilometres and based on current population growth rates are expected to become megacities in the 21st century.

In recent years, some cities have implemented transit-oriented development strategies to curb the urban sprawl. Notable examples include Melbourne 2030, South East Queensland Regional Plan and the Sydney Metropolitan Strategy. <ref>[[wikipedia:Environmental issues in Australia#Urbanization]]</ref>
