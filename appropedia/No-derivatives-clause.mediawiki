The '''No Derivative Works''' clause (commonly referred to as '''No Derivatives''') in some [[Creative Commons]] [[licenses]] allows reuse while not allowing any modification to the work. 

This restricts one of the [[Four Freedoms]]{{fact}} and such a license is not considered an [[open license]] (a.k.a. free license - "free" as in freedom of speech).

Such licenses aim to protect the work, but from what?
* being altered in ways that might lead to harm being done
* misunderstandings, people thinking that the altered work is actually the work of the original author.

However this clause also greatly restricts the usefulness of the work. Wikipedia, Appropedia and other successful [[wiki]] projects have shown the value of a community of editors, or of a single enthusiastic editor being able to modify an article, and add their own particular knowledge. 

Note that work under a no derivatives license '''cannot be used on Appropedia''' (other than in exceptional and temporary cases as part of the [[Appropedia:Open access pages|Open access pages]] policy, intended to serve a need until actual open content is made available).
