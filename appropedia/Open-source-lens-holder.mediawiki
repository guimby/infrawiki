This project is part of a collection on [[open source optics]] meant to radically reduce the cost of experimental optical equipment.<ref>Zhang C, Anzalone NC, Faria RP, Pearce JM (2013) [[Open-Source 3D-Printable Optics Equipment]]. ''PLoS ONE'' 8(3): e59840. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0059840 [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059840 open access]</ref>

This open source lens holder is designed to hold a 1 inch diameter lens and is comparable but more flexible than commercial optical equipment products such as the Thor Labs Lens Holder [http://www.thorlabs.com/thorProduct.cfm?partNumber=LMR1 here].

The lens holder consists of three components: the metal rod, the plastic base, and the lens holder.  The metal rod fits through the lens holder and the lens holder is held in place with a set screw.  The lens is placed within the lens holder is held in place with another set screw.  Care must be taken when placing the lens within the holder and using the set screw to not damage the optics by overly tightening the set screw.  The wide plastic base gives the whole setup stability and flexible placement.

This optical component is not designed to be fitted into an optical breadboard or lab bench.  The advantage of this is that there is no limit to placement for the lens holder within the optical system.  However, the disadvantage is loss of stability associated with an optical lab bench.
