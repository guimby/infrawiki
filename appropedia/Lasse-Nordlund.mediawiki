Hi Mark!

I remember you. You were talking to me about some Hirvitalo things. If
you like to use my and my wife's articles about self- suffiency, you
can use them freely, eg. put them into appropedia. I'm storing my
stuff at www.rihmasto.fi/artikkelit . You can download them there.
Spring is arriving and practicel work is calling.
Have a nice spring!

t. Lasse
