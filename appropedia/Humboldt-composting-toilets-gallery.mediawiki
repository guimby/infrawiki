===Composting Toilet===
*'''Description:''' This model was built by Sunfrost Systems. It is used for urination and defecation.
*'''Justification:''' This is an example of [[appropriate technology]] because it is not using water and energy to pump affluents to a waste disposal facility where it will be further processed, and more energy consumed.
*'''Issues:''' The composting toilet is simple and effective. Anybody can use/maintain it. The lavatory also doubles as a greenhouse, producing tasty grapes in the summer.
*'''Location:''' Arcata Educational Farm.
