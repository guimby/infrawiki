A '''Green Knowledge Trust''' is an envisaged [[green wiki]] or something in the same vein, as described in the vision of the [[Coalition of the Willing]]:

<blockquote>a green Wikipedia with a practical focus. The war effort needs more than just facts. We need an online repository of practical knowledge, a ‘how to’ guide for ordinary people tasked with setting-up functional, low-carbon societies. The Green Knowledge Trust is a place where people share high-quality knowledge on low carbon living. It would be information central for the war on global warming.<ref>[http://coalitionofthewilling.org.uk/read-the-script/ Read the Script], 'Coalition of the Willing' animated film.</ref></blockquote>

The other parts of the system are an [[Open Innovation Centre]] and a [[Catalyst System]] a social-networking site for connecting with partners in taking in action.
