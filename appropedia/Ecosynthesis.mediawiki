'''Ecosynthesis''' is using introduced species to fill niches in a disrupted environment. It aims to aid [[ecological restoration]]. It sees value in "[[weed]]" species which are more commonly considered pests.

An example is using [[willow]] ([[Salix alba]]X[[Salix fragilis|fragilis]]) in a stream corridor for sediment and phosphorus capture.
