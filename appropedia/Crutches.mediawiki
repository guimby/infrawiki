David Talbot is the founder of Crutches 4 Africa.<ref>http://www.crutches4africa.org/</ref> A polio survivor himself, David understands the need for mobility. While in Africa filming a documentary, David saw the obvious need for crutches. In particular was a woman, her right leg corkscrewed behind her with her foot touching the back of her shoulder. She was using a tree branch as a crutch.

George Orapa, also a polio victim, distributes crutches on a rented motor bike. The stockpile of 135 mobility devices was distributed in a matter of days.
