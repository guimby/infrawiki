'''Abstract:'''
This paper presents an analytical approach to thennal behaviors of laser welding of polymers. Laser polymers processing leads to various thennal, photophysical, and photochemical processes within the bulk and on the material surface. The understanding of these processes is beneficial to obtaining the high quality precision engineering of polymers. The Green's function of a multi-layer plate for the transient heat transfer is utilized to analyze the laser welding of PMMA and ABS/PC. The results indicate that the measured temperatures agree well with the calculated temperatures near laser source. The model proposed by this paper is applicable to the temperature prediction of the laser welding for polymers.:'''

'''Abstract:'''
Keyhole laser welding of polymers is a subject well covered and researched, but relatively little information exists regarding the welding of thin polymer ®lms, particularly to a heavier substrate. This paper presents the design of a suitable test apparatus for laser welding thin ®lm to a heavier substrate, and shows the results of an investigation into the feasibility of laser welding multi-layer polymer ®lm lids to tubs for the manufacture of aseptic food containers. A consistent weld, free from defects, is the key to process success. Typical welding defects have been synthesised in order to investigate, and consequently remove, their cause. The result is a reliable welding method based on even ®lm clamping. With careful attention to machine design, a seal of high mechanical strength and chemical integrity is possible. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diode lasers are widely used in communication, computer and consumer electronics technology. These applications are based on systems, which provide power in the milliwatt range. However, in the mean time high power diode lasers have reached the kilowatt power range.

'''Abstract:'''
On-line process monitoring of laser welding defects by detecting characteristic changes of the process emissions via photodiodes has high potential but, due to the complex process, lack of directly interpretable and thus controllable correlations. Deep analysis of the process by high speed imaging in combination with modelling enables one to discuss the correlations between the signal and the process, as was demonstrated for quasi-steady state conditions and for transient phenomena. Despite improved knowledge through the study, several uncertainties like the emissivity, the keyhole radiation characteristics and the temperature field need to be identified more accurately for a complete theoretical description of the signal causes.

'''Abstract:'''
Deep penetration welding and cutting of metals can be carried out at high speed with relatively low laser power. The efficient coupling of the laser radiation to the metal is due to the formation of a "keyhole." Over the years, an attempt has been made to transfer the results on metals to plastics. It will be shown here that keyhole welding of plastics is limited to the very restricted set of plastics that have a boiling point. Volume heating, a mechanism that is not applicable to metals, is restricted to plastics with a good transparency for the incident radiation and with a high optical quality. Finally, surface heating is shown to be the most common mechanism for heating plastics.

'''Abstract:'''
The laser beam weldability of acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS) plates is determined by combining both experimental and theoretical aspects. In modeling the process, an optical model is used to determine how the laser beam is attenuated by the first material and to obtain the laser beam profile at the interface. Using this information as the input data to a thermal model, the evolution of the temperature field within the two components can be estimated. The thermal model is based on the first principles of heat transfer and utilizes the temperature variation laws of material properties. Corroborating the numerical results with the experimental results, some important insights concerning the fundamental phenomena that govern the process could be extracted. This approach proved to be an efficient tool in determining the weldability of polimeric materials and assures a significant reduction of time and costs with the experimental exploration.

'''Abstract:'''
The realization of microfluidic packages by stacking and bonding several layers of microstructured polymer films opens up the potential of creating complex three-dimensional microfluidic structures based on relatively simple two-dimensional manufacturing processes. Whereas a multitude of microstructuring techniques have been developed, packaging and bonding technologies for multilayer microfluidic devices are still underrepresented. Bulk bonding processes like thermal diffusion bonding fit well into a lab environment, but feature extensive bonding times. With increasing fluidic complexity, bonding technologies that enable selective bonding and sealing at pre-selected areas (e.g. around channel walls or process chambers) are required. Selective bonding technologies enable a localized heat generation exactly at the desired bond position and thus significantly reduce the risk of structure deformation and channel clogging. In this paper, experimental results for a variety of bulk and selective bonding methods are reported and compared. Surface modification of polymers and lasers welding of polymer sheets are identified as suitable technologies for integration with high-throughput production environments.

'''Abstract:''' 
In this study, a three dimensional numerical heat transfer model has been used to simulate the laser structuring of polymer substrate material in the Three-Dimensional Molded Interconnect Device (3D MID) which is used in the advanced multi-functional applications. A finite element method (FEM) transient thermal analysis is performed using APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) provided by ANSYS. In this model, the effect of surface heat source was modeled with Gaussian distribution, also the effect of the mixed boundary conditions which consist of convection and radiation heat transfers have been considered in this analysis. The model provides a full description of the temperature distribution, as well as calculates the depth and the width of the groove upon material removal at different set of laser parameters such as laser power and laser speed. This study also includes the experimental procedure to study the effect of laser parameters on the depth and width of the removal groove metal as verification to the modeled results. Good agreement between the experimental and the model results is achieved for a wide range of laser powers. It is found that the quality of the laser structure process is affected by the laser scan speed and laser power. For a high laser structured quality, it is suggested to use laser with high speed and moderate to high laser power.

'''Abstract:'''
This article first reviews non-traditional heat exchanger geometry, laser welding, practical issues with microchannel heat exchangers, and high effectiveness heat exchangers. Existing microchannel heat exchangers have low material costs, but high manufacturing costs. This article presents a new expanded microchannel heat exchanger design and accompanying continuous manufacturing technique for potential low-cost production. Polymer heat exchangers have the potential for high effectiveness. This article discusses one possible joining method - a new type of laser welding named 'forward conduction welding', used to fabricate the prototype. The expanded heat exchanger has the potential to have counter-flow, cross-flow, or parallel-flow configurations, be used for all types of fluids, and be made of polymers, metals, or polymer-ceramic precursors. The cost and ineffectiveness reduction may be an order of magnitude or more, saving a large fraction of primary energy. The measured effectiveness of the prototype with 28 mm thick black low-density polyethylene walls and counterflow, water-to-water heat transfer in 2 mm channels was 72 per cent, but multiple low-cost stages could realize the potential of higher effectiveness.

'''Abstract:'''
Thermoplastics are highly attractive substrate materials for microfluidic systems, with important benefits in the development of low cost disposable devices for a host of bioanalytical applications. While significant research activity has been directed towards the formation of microfluidic components in a wide range of thermoplastics, sealing of these components is required for the formation of enclosed microchannels and other microfluidic elements, and thus bonding remains a critical step in any thermoplastic microfabrication process. Unlike silicon and glass, the diverse material properties of thermoplastics opens the door to an extensive array of substrate bonding options, together with a set of unique challenges which must be addressed to achieve optimal sealing results. In this paper we review the range of techniques developed for sealing thermoplastic microfluidics and discuss a number of practical issues surrounding these various bonding methods.

'''Abstract:'''
The use of laser welding for joining micro parts has experienced a substantial increase in popularity during recent years. Specifically translucent microfluidic devices are assembled using laser welding; however, a major issue is the laser beam size of commercially available laser-welding equipment and thus the resulting welding seam size, which may be orders of magnitude larger than microfluidic channels and structures. We have successfully achieved extremely small welding seams using focussed low-power laser diodes. Commercial laser welding stations for polymer assembly will typically operate in the power-region 15–50 Watts. The focussed laser beam will have a size of typically 500 μm × 500 μm and may, depending on optical configuration, be up to several mm2. The resulting welding-seam will thus be in the area of 300–600 μm depending on beam energy distribution; additionally the melt will spread to unheated areas due to capillary forces. As microfluidic channels are in 20–100 μm regions, even a very limited amount of stray melt may completely fill a part of a channel and thus render it useless. We have used commercially available “single-die” laser-diodes of optical power 200–500 mW. The beam has been focussed and directed using simple optical installations, resulting in a beam-size in the area of 50 μm × 5 μm full width half maximum (FWHM) We have achieved firm welding seams of width <10 μm, with a welding speed of 15 mm/s and with virtually no noticeable spread of melt.

'''Abstract:'''
This study concerns the welding of polypropylene with diode laser using the overlap joint method. The influence of process parameters, both the laser power (20–40 W) and the welding speed (3–6 mm/s) on the geometry and the microstructure of the weld zone were investigated. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of selected welding parameters on the seam geometry, defects and material crystallinity. The out coming results help with the choice of the welding parameters that can satisfy the demands of users and consumers with respect of good quality and safety of the process.

Microscopic observations performed on the cross section of the joining area reveal that the increase of the laser power and the decrease of the scanning speed lead to a larger volume of the weld zone with a more important depth penetration. The geometry of the weld zone is elliptic. Microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy method shows that diode laser welding induces thermal degradation of the polypropylene by random chain scissions. An increase of the crystallinity along the cross section of the welding joint was observed with a maximum reached in the centre of the weld zone. Some process parameters produced the occurrence of a void due to the thermal decomposition and the vaporisation of the polypropylene.

'''Abstract:'''
In recent years, laser transmission welding has gained in significance by displaying its specific advantages among the established welding processes for thermoplastics. However, a deep understanding of the developed process variants is so far missing. Useful results for temperature development were obtained in cases of high absorption constants by setting up an analytical model by analogy to single-sided heat impulse welding. Yet there is no physico-mathematical model considering the different energy conditions for joining parts with various absorption properties. This investigation is a first step towards a deep and detailed insight into the heating phase of the laser transmission welding process. Experimental data for temperature progression was collected for polypropylene. In addition, an analysis of the heat transfer problem using the finite element method showed a good level of agreement with the experimental results.

'''Abstract:'''
The mean peel resistance force achieved with respect to variation in the laser power, incident spot traverse velocity and incident spot diameter between linear low density polyethylene film backed by a thin commercial adhesive coating that were bonded to a polypropylene (PP) substrate via thermal activation provided by a 27W CO2 laser is discussed in this work. The results gathered for this work have been used to generate a novel empirical tool that predicts the CO2 laser power required to achieve a viable adhesive bond for this material combination. This predictive tool will enable the packaging industry to achieve markedly increased financial yield, process efficiency, reduced material waste and process flexibility. A laser spot size-dependent linear increase in laser line energy was necessary for this material combination, suggesting the minimal impact of thermal strain rate. Moreover, a high level of repeatability around this threshold laser line energy was indicated, suggesting that laser-activated adhesive bonding of such polymer films is viable. The adhesion between the material combination trialled here responded linearly to thermal load. In particular, when using the smallest diameter laser spot, it is proposed that the resulting high irradiance caused
film or adhesive material damage, thus resulting in reduced peel resistance force. The experimental work conducted indicated that the processing window of an incident CO2 laser spot increases with respect to spot diameter, simultaneously yielding greater bond stability in the face of short-term laser variance. © 2015 The Authors.

Laser welding of plastics is one area that is evolving rapidly as new lasers and associated benefits emerge. The benefits to the medical segment are; minimum material displacement, low thermal and mechanical stress induced, no vibration and no such mechanical damage to a part, no particulates. This paper will look at the development of a predictive model for laser welding using NIR absorbers. A Design of Experiment (DOE) approach will determine the

'''Abstract:''' 
New high performance polymers have been developed that challenge traditional encapsulation materials for permanent active medical implants. The gold standard for hermetic encapsulation for implants is a titanium enclosure which is sealed using laser welding. Polymers may be an alternative encapsulation material. Although many polymers are biocompatible, and permeability of polymers may be reduced to acceptable levels, the ability to create a hermetic join with an extended life remains the barrier to widespread acceptance of polymers for this application. This article provides an overview of the current techniques used for direct bonding of polymers, with a focus on thermoplastics. Thermal bonding methods are feasible, but some take too long and/or require two stage processing. Some methods are not suitable because of excessive heat load which may be delivered to sensitive components within the capsule. Laser welding is presented as the method of choice; however the establishment of suitable laser process parameters will require significant research.
