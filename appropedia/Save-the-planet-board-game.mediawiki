[[image:Save-the-world-game.png|right|500px]]'''Save The Planet Board Game''' is free and open-source DIY cooperative board game.  In the Save the Planet Game you and your family and friends can work together to save the planet to win, while learning how to save the planet in real life. The beginner option is appropriate for children 4 and up and the advanced option is a fun game for teens up to any age. This game is open-source so you are encouraged to build on it - make it better, add more good deeds, make a local deed list and make more advanced derivatives. Have fun!
 
== Making the Game ==
[[image:reBox.png|right|200px]]
# Print out in color the two pages of Good Deeds [[file:Good deeds-small.pdf]] and the 4 pages of the game board and penalty pollution squares [[file:Boards2small.pdf]]. If you have a [[RepRap]] you can print this [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:283083 handy box]. (This [https://www.myminifactory.com/object/card-holder-for-save-the-planet-board-game-35620 one is sized for version 2 of the game).
# Trim the outer edge with scissors then use a glue stick to stick them to the back of cereal boxes
# Cut out the deeds and penalty pollution squares and cut the big pollution image into a puzzle
# For a more durable game laminate everything (you can skip the cardboard if you do this)
# Obtain 4 avatars - these can be pieces from other games, little toys, strips of colored paper, pebbles or 4 different coins or you could print avatars like the pieces from [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40363 Democratic Chess] for a useful list see the derivatives [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250558 here]
# Obtain one normal 6 sided die (or dice) from one of the following ways
## Steal one of the dice from Monopoly
## If you have a 3D printer or access to one - print one from a open design [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:113451 here]
## Use 6 pennies - heads =1 and tails =0 throw them and add your points together if you get zero - try again.

== Playing the Game ==

'''Synopsis:''' Play this game as a team - <u>with</u> one another <u>not against</u> one another. Your goal is to clear the pollution pieces (housing on a river of waste and litter) to let the passive solar eco-home see the sun before the oil and coal industry ruin the planet with pollution.
[[image:Game board top.jpg|right]]
# Each person places their avatars on the [[Ubuntu]]<ref> '''Ubuntu''' is a Bantu term roughly translating to "human kindness." It is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity". The term was made popular by a type of [[Linux]], the free and [[open source]] operating system. </ref> circles in the corners of the game board. 4 avatars can play simultaneously (If you have for more than four people that want to play - share an avatar.)
# Stack all of pollution penalty pieces in a pile.
# Choose either the [[Save_the_planet_board_game#Beginner | Beginner]] (white border) or [[Save_the_planet_board_game#Advanced|Advanced]] (black border) Good Deed Cards and spread them face down next to the board
#  Assemble the pollution puzzle in the middle of the board on top of the eco-home. Your goal is to work as a team to take the pollution puzzle apart and make a nice sustainable home by doing Good Deeds to save the planet. You win when the Eco-home shows through and you still have some earth images not covered with pollution penalties.
# Youngest player rolls first and turns proceed clockwise. A player rolls the die, moves his avatar the number of spaces shown and does what the space shows.
## If you land on a [[renewable energy]] square ([[solar photovoltaic]]<ref> Photovoltaics turn sunlight directly into electricity and is the most likely method to provide an energy intensive standard of living in a sustainable fashion. See: Joshua Pearce, "Photovoltaics - A Path to Sustainable Futures", Futures 34(7), 663-674, 2002.[http://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1540219/Photovoltaics_-_a_path_to_sustainable_futures open access]</ref>, [[wind power]], [[microhydro]], [[geothermal]], [[solar thermal]], [[biomass]] (wood stove), [[passive solar]]) you earn one Good Deed card. If you have 3 Good Deed cards you can turn them in to remove a piece of the pollution puzzle. '''If you remove all the pollution puzzle pieces you win!'''
## If you land on the hybrid solar wind system double block you get two Good Deed cards. Likewise if you land on the [[climate change]] double block you get two pollution penalty cards.
## If you land on a [[sustainable transportation]] square ([[walking]], [[bicycles]], [[electric car]], or [[train]]) you may move your avatar anywhere on the board.
## [[image:Pollution penalties.jpg|right|200px]] If you land on either an [[oil spill]] or [[coal]] plant emissions you must put the appropriate pollution penalty card on one of the exposed squares on the ring of earths. ''''''If all of your earths are covered with pollution penalty cards you all lose and the game is over unless you "make a save" by completing one of the Good Deeds as a team in real life'''<ref> This must be a "new" Good Deed - e.g. your family can not get credit for recycling if you do that anyway.</ref> to remove one penalty card (e.g. starting a compost pile or writing as a family to your elected representative). '''
## If you land on one of the ubuntu corners your team can pool your Good Deed cards to get 3 in order to remove a pollution puzzle piece.
# On your turn you may trade in a Good Deed card to remove a pollution penalty card.
# In the normal game play continues until the world is lost and completely polluted in which case your team loses or until all of the pollution puzzle is disassembled and you win. If having any pollution on the earth makes you mad you can continue to play and try to extract all the pollution penalties from the circle of earth. If you can do this - your team has dominated the game. Nice work! Hint: the best way to do this is to actually do real new good deeds by making a bunch of saves in a row. Once you have beaten the beginner version try the more advanced version.

== Good Deed Cards==
=== Beginner===
[[image:Gd-white.jpg|right]]
These are good deeds you and your family can do around your home. As most of them save physical resources, they not only shrink your environmental impact, but they also will save you money. The white bordered pieces:
* '''[[Energy star]]''' is a U.S. government-backed program helping businesses and individuals protect the environment through superior energy efficiency.
* '''Power strips''' are a convenient way of eliminating [[phantom loads]] from modern gadget collections like computers.
* '''[[LED]]s''' are currently the most efficient source of lighting - change your bulbs to cut down on energy use and pollution while saving money and time (they last far longer than normal bulbs so you don't need to change them as much). To see how much money your family could save by making the switch - check out this [[File:LED_incan_cfl_worksheet2.ods| spreadsheet]].<ref> The spreadsheet is in ODS format - get your free copy of [https://www.libreoffice.org/ Libre Office] to open it.</ref>
* '''[[House insulation]]''' is one of the most cost effective ways to reduce energy use in your house.
* '''Goodwill''' You have lots of stuff you probably do not need any more - but someone else might. Earn some tax credits by donating your used stuff to [http://www.goodwill.org/ Good Will] or [http://www.svdpusa.org/ Saint Vincent DePaul], [http://salvationarmyusa.org/ Salvation Army] or other similar service such as [https://www.freecycle.org/ Freecycle].
* '''[[Recycle]]''' - recycling saves massive amounts of resources.
* '''[http://www.meatlessmonday.com/ Meatless Monday]''' - Eating meat is surprisingly energy, water and land intensive.<ref> http://smallplanet.org/books/diet-small-planet</ref> It can take seven or more pounds of grain to produce one pound of beef, and livestock consumes 70 percent of America’s grain. Eat less of it and choose pasture-fed, sustainably raised beef whenever you can. If you alone gave it up once every seven days, you would save the 840 gallons of fresh water it takes to produce a single serving. To make it easier to obtain a sustainable state try a baby step and give up meat on Mondays.
* '''[[Garden]]''' -- Learning to grow your own food is a fun family activity that is also a great way to shrink your [[ecological footprint]] and save some money at the grocery store.
* Shorten shower - Long showers waste a lot of water and your time - try limiting them to 4 minutes or if you really want to be hard core try a marine shower: turn water on only long enough to get wet, turn it off, soap up, and then rinse off and get out.
* '''[[Insulate]] pipes''' - the piping from conventional hot water heaters loses a lot of heat - cheap pipe insulation available in all hardware stores is a fun project to do with children to save money in the home.
* '''[[Caulk]]''' - Cut out the air leaks in your house and your heating and cooling bills with caulk. Caulk [http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11270] and weather-strip [http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11280] around all openings and cracks
* '''[[Compost]]''' - a nice way to make free organic fertilizer from organic waste while cutting your waste removal fees.
* Eating [[Organic food]] reduces the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and environmental impacts in most situations (Ideally target local in season organic or grow it in your own backyard).
* '''Clean beach''' - if you live near water a fun family outing is cleaning up the beach.
* '''Turn off water''' -- when you are not using it. The average faucet releases about three gallons of water per minute, so shut it off while you brush your teeth or shave.
* '''Turn off lights''' -- when not in the room to save energy and cut pollution.
* '''Enjoy Nature''' -- remember why the earth is important go enjoy nature!
* '''Don't litter'''.
* '''Clean plate''' - Eat all your food and be thankful that you have it. Every day over 20,000 people die of hunger related causes. <ref>http://www.bread.org/hunger/global/</ref> If you don't eat your food you are wasting resources.
* '''Use cloth napkins''' - use single use paper products as infrequently as possible.
* '''Fix stuff.''' Instead of throwing things out when they break be a [[maker]] and learn how to fix them.
* '''Computer [[sleep mode]]''' can help save energy that your computer wastes when you are not using it. See [[Energy-efficient PC/workstations]] for more information.
* '''No smoking''' -- Smoking is terrible for your health and wastes incredible quantities of natural resources.
* '''Protect wildlife'''
* '''Turn down heat.''' (in winter) This saves energy, pollution and money.
* '''Programmable digital thermostats''' allow you to ensure your home is comfortable when you are home - but allows you to set back the energy use when you are away (e.g. school or work during the week) or at night after you have gone to sleep.  All of these setbacks allow you to save energy and save money while reducing pollution.
* '''Ceiling fans''' use far less energy than air conditioners.
* '''Sweater''' - throw one on and then turn down the heat in the winter.
* '''Cloth shopping bag''' - better than paper or plastic.
* '''Hang clothes to dry'''. A clothesline or rack  can be used to dry your clothes by the air. Your wardrobe will maintain color and fit, and you will save money.
* '''Re-use cup''' - to cut down on wasted resources to make single use cups.
* '''[[Rain barrel]]s''' can be used to collect rain for your garden and save your water bills.
* '''E-Recycle''' - We go throw huge amounts of electronic waste every year. Help capture some of the valuable materials by recycling it. To find a place near you see [http://www.electronicsrecycling.org/public/ this]
* '''Turn off the AC''' whenever you can.
* '''Cold wash''' - uses less energy costs less.
* '''Print 2 sided.''' American businesses throw away 21 million tons of paper every year, which is 175 pounds per office worker or about his weight. For a quick and easy way to halve this while cutting you paper costs in half, set your printer's default option to print double-sided (duplex printing). 
* '''[[Rechargeable batteries]]''' cut down on waste and can save you a lot of money <ref>http://www.thesimpledollar.com/are-rechargeable-batteries-really-cost-effective/</ref>
* '''Water saving fixtures.'''  Install faucet aerators and high-efficiency showerheads and in a year’s time you’ll save between 1,000 and 8,000 gallons of water. 
* '''Plant trees''' as they are good for the air, the land, can shade your house and save on cooling (plant on the west side of your home), and they can also improve the value of your property. Do even better planting fruit trees. Worried about shading your rooftop solar cells? Use this:[[Simple and low-cost method of planning for tree growth and lifetime effects on solar photovoltaic systems performance]]
* '''Inflate tires''' - You can improve the fuel efficiency of your automobile simply by ensuring the tires are properly inflated. If car care facilities systematically offered complimentary tire pressure checks with oil changes we would enjoy : increased safety by decreasing all crashes and saving more than 100 lives, reduced petroleum consumption by over a billion gallons/year, which would provide ~$4 billion in economic savings for U.S. consumers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 13.5 million tons and automobile pollution and enhance national security.<ref>Joshua M. Pearce and Jason T. Hanlon, "Energy Conservation From Systematic Tire Pressure Regulation", Energy Policy, 35(4), pp. 2673-2677, 2007.

==Make this game better==
If you like this game, please try to improve it. If you see red links above click on them and fill in the missing content. Provide more information and references for the good deeds listed above. If you have new ideas about good deeds or other ways you think we could change the game to make it more fun and a better learning experience for children and adults alike - please click one of the "edits" and list them here:

== Game in a Box==
This game was inspired by the 1980's game: ''A Beautiful Place - A Co-operative Ecology Game''. The DIY game above is more detailed and advanced - but if you want to buy something in a box rather than make it yourself - I recommend it -- particularly for young children to start thinking ecologically.  The award winning game practices what it preaches - the game is made in Canada using recycled boards and papers, soy-based inks, water based glues and safe paints. You can get it on [http://www.amazon.com/Family-Pastimes-Beautiful-Place-Co-operative/dp/B000VTOF8S Amazon] -- and you might want to check out the other cooperative games by [http://www.familypastimes.ca/ Family Pasttimes].
