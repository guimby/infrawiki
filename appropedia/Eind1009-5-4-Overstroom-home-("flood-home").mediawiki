== ''Day 1 (Monday 12 October 2009)''  ==
This first day every individual had to create his or her own design. These designs were sorted by style and by used construction-techniques, this way groups were formed to work in the second and third day. --[[User:Rob Valk|Rob Valk]] 14:16, 18 October 2009 (UTC)

== ''Day 2 (Tuesday 13 October 2009)''  ==
Tuesday we, as a group, had to think about how the make the best design out of the six design we had already standing in front of us. <more description soon> --[[User:Rob Valk|Rob Valk]] 14:16, 18 October 2009 (UTC)
