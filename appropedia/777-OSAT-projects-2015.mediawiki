# Identify an [[OSAT]] that you would like to design to be a 3D printable technology
# Make sure someone else has not already done it : existing designs [[:Category:OSAT_3D-Printable_Designs|here]]. (You can choose to do a major improvement on past design)
# Reserve your OSAT by signature tagging with <nowiki> ~~~~ </nowiki> next to the OSAT on the list generated by the Appropedia community: [[Requests for 3-D printable open source appropriate technology]]. You can add your own ideas to the list, more than one of you can tackle the same tech in a different way, you may improve upon existing designs if you do so in a '''significant''' way. Double check someone else has not already done a better job - use http://yeggi.com '''Do this by 11/17'''
# Design 3D printable components with <u>ONLY</u> OS CAD packages (e.g. OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, or Blender) for FreeCAD put on https://libre3d.com and link back to it on Appropedia.
# Create a Appropedia page for your project. (Easiest way to create a page is to search for the name of it and then click on the red link or in the list put double square brackets around it)
# Include the following sections on your page using the template below (copy and paste wiki markup into your page)
# Add picture and link to your project page in gallery below.
# Print component and bring to class - '''Complete and due by 12/8'''

=Grading=
* 20% Print quality
* 30% Documentation
* 25% Design (design for printing, plastic minimization)
* 25% Function - Is it OSAT? Does it work?

Automatic reductions:
-50% no source or the use of non-OS software
-10% per day for late

{{777}}
==Title of the device or system ==
 Project developed by [your name linked to your user account]
{{Statusboxtop}}
{{status-design}}
{{status-prototype}}
You can help Appropedia by contributing to the next step in this [[OSAT]]'s [[:Category:Status|status]].
{{boxbottom}}

==Abstract==
# Paragraph description of the OSAT - why is it Appropriate? What need does it fulfil? Are there case studies you have found of a technology being used successfully?
# Picture of completed print using [[Image:Wood_WorkingClamp_Parts.png|200px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# Provide a full BOM -- Materials needed for fabrication of device and alternative materials if they are not available, prices/sources of non-printable parts
## Upload and link to all source files from open source CAD
## Upload and link to all STLs

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
#

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* If you used special skill – link to relevant wikipedia or wikiversity articles/courses

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Provide directions for print/assembly - be detailed enough in your “how to” to ensure that someone could construct the device from your description. Consider the elegance of IKEA like instructions.
# Include print time estimate
# Include assembly time estimate
# Including drawings or pictures of the device at stage of assembly at minimum. (http://www.appropedia.org/Special:Upload)
# Consider video if appropriate

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Include common mistakes/problems to avoid in building your OSAT and how to overcome them

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Estimate your costs
# Find a commercial equivalent
# Calculate $ savings and % savings

==References==

* The sources of information (e.g. engineering handbooks, journal articles, government documents, webpages, books, magazine articles etc.). References should use the <nowiki> <ref> </ref> and <references/>  </nowiki>tags and can be in any format but should include all the information necessary for someone else to find the same information you did. For example: <ref> web page: Department of Energy (DOE) Landscaping and Energy Efficiency, DOE/GO-10095 (1995) Available: http://www.eren.doe.gov/erec/factsheets/landscape.html</ref>

Based on the developmental needs addressed (e.g. food, heat, electricity, clean water, health  care, etc.) be sure to label your device in the proper categories e.g. use [[Category:Water]]. Be sure to categorize your device so that it will be easy to find – for example “Low voltage connection basics” is categorized in 



[[Category:How tos]]
[[Category:Electricity]]
[[Category:Electric lighting]].
