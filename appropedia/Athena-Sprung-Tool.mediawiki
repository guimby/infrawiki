The sprung tool mount requires the small tool effector.

= Assembly =

# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_dressing.JPG|thumb|right|Dress the print.]] Clean up the print with a small flat screw driver and precision mount. Clean the bearing pockets with the small screwdriver.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_reaming.JPG|thumb|right|Ream the guides.]] Carefully ream the guides for the M3 x 35mm screws. DO NOT ream too much - the screw shafts should move freely but not cant in the guides.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_support.JPG|thumb|right|Remove supports.]] Carefully remove the printed supports from the tool holder; pliers work nicely. Ream the holes with a 3mm drill bit.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_check.JPG|thumb|right|Check fit of holder in mount.]] Check that the tool holder fits in the mount. The holder should move freely in the mount. Clean both as required.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_press.JPG|thumb|right|Press in M3 nuts.]] Press the M3 nuts into their pockets in the tool holder with the pliers.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_clamps.JPG|thumb|right|Start M3 x 10mm screws in nuts.]] Start the M3 x 10mm screws in the just-inserted nuts.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_assemble.JPG|thumb|right|Assemble holder and mount.]] Place the tool holder into the mount with the screws and nuts on the top side of the mount. Rotate 60 degrees so screw holes align. Start an M3 x 35mm screw through one of the tabs in the top of the holder, place a spring on it and push it through the mount and then the tab on the opposite side of the holder. Secure in place with an M3 nylock nut. Repeate with remaining screws.{{clear}}
# Work the holder up and down in the mount, apply some grease to the screw shafts and continue working until the holder moves freely in the mount.
# Remove all grease and corrosion inhibitor from the ball bearings. Use acetone if necessary.
# [[File:Athena_sprung_bearings.JPG|thumb|right|Put bearings on magnets.]] Put the ball bearings on the three inner magnets on the bottom of the small tool effector.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_sprung_tool_epoxy.JPG|thumb|right|Epoxy bearing pockets.]] Mix a small amount of epoxy and smear some around the interior of the bearing pockets. Align the fiduciary marks on the sprung tool mount and small tool effector and squeeze the sprung tool mount onto the ball bearings. Set aside to let epoxy cure. NOTE: If too much epoxy is applied to the bearing pockets, it can run down and epoxy the tool mount permanently to the tool effector.{{clear}}
