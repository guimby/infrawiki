=='''What is a VPN?''' ==
A VPN allows users to create a secure connection over the public Internet to private networks at a remote location. <ref name="What is a VPN"> http://www.hotspotshield.com/learn/what-is-a-vpn. </ref> It does this through a combination of services such as encryption, tunneling protocols, data encapsulation, and certified connections. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> A VPN uses these services and masks the users IP address. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> This is done by exchanging the users IP address with the VPN server’s IP address. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> By doing this, users receive privacy for online activities and the threat of revealing the users identity, location, ISP, and specific Internet activity is removed. Also, they allow users to bypass regional Internet restrictions, which provide access to content or Internet services that otherwise, are restricted or censored. 

There are two types of VPNs, Site-to-site VPNs and Remote Access VPNs. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> Hotspot Shield uses Remote Access VPNs, which allow an individual computer to connect to a private network. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> Within Remote Access VPNs, there are two categories Corporate VPNs and Personal VPNs. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/> For the Hotspot Shield service, they use Personal VPNs, which allow users to connect to networks and remotely access resources and services. <ref name=" What is a VPN "/>

=='''Hotspot Shield Around the World'''==
'''China'''

In China, the internet is heavily censored by the government, but users of Hotpot Shield are able to access any and all webpage’s. <ref name="Fast Company"> http://www.fastcompany.com/1754491/web-anonymizers-and-arab-spring. </ref> There are 5 million users per month that get onto Google and 2-3 million a month that access Facebook and YouTube. <ref name=" Fast Company "/> At one point, China blocked Hotspot Shields website, but users found a way around it. <ref name=" Fast Company "/> The users would email the product to each other and in response, Hotspot Shield created an email autoresponder that would send a message with the product attached. <ref name=" Fast Company "/>

'''Egypt'''

In 2011, the Mubarak regime enforced restrictions on mobile and Internet communication. <ref name="Egypt one"> http://blog.hotspotshield.com/2012/08/09/hotspot-shield-the-egypt-situation-online-freedom-and-you/. </ref> To counteract these limitations, Egyptian citizens started downloading Hotspot Shield so that they could access Internet sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. <ref name=" Egypt one "/> Before the revolution, there were about 100,000 users in Egypt and after the restrictions were placed, there were over 1 million users in Egypt. <ref name=" Egypt one "/> Later, the Egyptian government completely shut down the internet, but this didn’t stop people, they were able to use their dial up and phone connections to get online and access Hotspot Shield and communicate through social media sites such as Twitter. <ref name=" Egypt two "/>


'''Libya'''

In 2011, Hotspot Shield was able to track when the Libyan government would turn off the country’s Internet. <ref name="Libya"> http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/10/23/hotspot-shield-a-quiet-hero-for-internet-privacy-and-security-around-the-world/. </ref>  During the day, there would be around 30,000 Hotspot Shield users, but in the evenings, there would be zero. <ref name=" Fast Company "/> The entire country would go dark in the evenings, but there would be users again in the morning. CEO David Gorodyansky said in an interview that his guess as to why this pattern occurred, was that “they would turn on the internet in the morning so oil companies would function, but they would shut it off at night so people couldn’t organize after work.” <ref name=" Fast Company "/>


'''Turkey''' 

Thursday March 20, 2014, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan placed a ban on Twitter. <ref name="Turkey one"> http://blog.hotspotshield.com/2014/03/27/turkish-citizens-overcame-twitter-ban-with-hotspotshield/. </ref> This ban was enforced after allegations of government corruption were shared through the social media site and not removed. <ref name="bbc"> http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26714214 . </ref> After the ban, Turkish citizens and people within the country began using Google’s DNS service which allowed them to directly type in Twitters IP address and access the network rather than accessing “Twitter.com.” <ref name=" bbc "/> This was then stopped by the government and people in Turkey turned to VPNs such as Hotspot Shield. <ref name=" bbc "/> Within 12 hours, Hotspot Shield had 270,000 downloads from Turkish users. <ref name="Turkey two"> http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/21/turkeys-twitter-ban-boosts-downloads-of-a-vpn/. </ref>


'''Venezuela''' 

In February 2014, citizens began protesting in the streets of Venezuela. These protests are in response to the governments rising inflation and increased criminal violence. <ref name=" Business Insider "/> The high-profile murder of Monica Spear, former Miss Venezuela is just one example of the increased criminal violence. In response to the citizen protests, the Venezuelan government has begun censoring parts of the Internet. <ref name=" Business Insider "/> Twitter was blocked “in an attempt to make the protests seem less widespread.” <ref name=" Business Insider "/> In March, AnchorFree made the premium version of its iOS app available to those in Venezuela. <ref name=" Business Insider "/> Venezuelan citizens are very well connected with 83 percent with internet access that use social media, 83 percent owning a cell phone and one third of the population having a smartphone. <ref name="venezuela"> http://www.latinpost.com/articles/9340/20140322/venezuela-protesters-get-free-access-to-hotspot-shield-vpn-app.htm .</ref>
