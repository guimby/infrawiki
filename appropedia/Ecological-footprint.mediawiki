'''Ecological footprint''' (EF) is a way of measuring demand on the Earth's [[ecosystems]] and natural resources. It refers to a number of different methods of analysis which give differing results, and is also used less strictly - to "reduce your footprint" doesn't automatically imply you have done an analysis.

Indeed, the analysis is only useful if it leads to results, and so taking steps toward a [[Green living|greener lifestyle]] are what matters most.
