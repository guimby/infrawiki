== What communities can do ==
{{topico}}
*become low carbon communities, or develop a [[Community climate action plan]]
*promote the sharing of climate change and CO2 data
*participatory carbon budgeting
*organise climate action events 
*join climate action networks
*Emissions Reduction Community based currency schemes

== Campaigns ==

[http://350.org/ 350.org], international environmental organization encouraging citizens to action with the belief that publicizing the increasing levels of carbon dioxide will pressure world leaders to address climate change and to reduce levels from 400 parts per million to 350 parts per million. It was founded by author Bill McKibben with the goal of building a global grassroots movement to raise awareness about anthropogenic climate change, to confront climate change denial, and to cut emissions of carbon dioxide in order to slow the rate of global warming. 350.org takes its name from the research of Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist James E. Hansen, who posited in a 2007 paper that 350 parts-per-million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point. {{W|350.org}}

== Why it matters ==

Because of the time lag in the carbon system, and due to our past emissions - we are still going to experience a certain level of climate change. Even if we stopped all emissions tomorrow we would expect another 30-40 years of temperature rise, and more than a century of sea-level rise. <ref> Climate change is happening now - world needs to respond urgently, [http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070406a.htm Defra], April 6 2007 ''(link not found May 2015)''</ref>

=== Climate change fairness, justice and peace ===
"Indications of changes in the earth's future climate must be treated with the utmost seriousness, and with the precautionary principle uppermost in our minds. Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind. They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth's resources. Such changes will place particularly heavy burdens on the world's most vulnerable countries. There may be increased danger of violent conflicts and wars, within and between states." <ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 2007], October 12 2007 </ref> 

=== Climate justice ===
Recognizing and addressing the fact that those least responsible for climate change experience its greatest impacts is seen by many as being central to climate justice. {{W|Climate justice}}

=== Climate change and inequality ===

“Unless the burden of poverty in developing nations is alleviated by significant financial support for mitigation, [[Climate change adaption|adaptation]], and the reduction of deforestation, the ability of developing countries to pursue sustainable development is likely to diminish, to the economic and environmental detriment of all.” 22 leading climate scientists <ref>[http://repeatingislands.com/2009/07/09/caricom-and-climate-challenges-for-the-caribbean/ Repeating Islands], July 9, 2009 </ref>

=== Why climate change is a women’s issue ===
"Women are more likely to die or suffer the long term consequences of the rising tide of natural disasters and resource wars unleashed by climate change, and are largely excluded from the search for solutions," <ref>

== Emissions Reduction Community based currency schemes ==

A community based emissions reduction currency scheme is a C4 type local currency in which local currency issues are backed by the emissions reductions of the schemes members. The local currency, when accepted for trade by other members or local businesses, thereby rewards participants for their efforts at global warming prevention. These currencies may have various degrees of convertibility into carbon saved, renewable energy, or national currency. {{W|Emissions Reduction Currency System#Community based currency schemes}}

== Low Carbon Communities ==

The Low Carbon Communities network is a UK based network of communities and organisations working to halt global warming as far as is possible. {{W|Low Carbon Communities}} / [http://www.lowcarboncommunities.org/ Low Carbon Communities]

== Open CO2 ==

Open CO2 is a project to help crowdsource open carbon accounts for local communities worldwide. It can also be about carbon literacy, encouraging ourselves to learn more about what the available data might show. 
Open local carbon accounts would help make possible [[Participatory carbon budgeting]]. ''See separate article:'' [[Open CO2]]

== Participatory carbon budgeting ==

The idea is to combine two other ideas: participatory budgeting {{W|Participatory budgeting}} and a carbon budget for an area, typically a large town or city. ''See separate article:'' [[Participatory carbon budgeting]]

[[File:Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Protest at Tufts University.jpg|120px|left]]
'''February 13 and 14, 2015''' - Global Divestment Day, "Let’s make fossil fuels history." <br>
The actions during the Global Divestment Day will be wide-ranging and diverse. Individuals are gearing up to close their accounts with banks and pension funds investing in fossil fuel companies. University students are planning to hold flash-mobs, vigils, sit-ins and rallies calling upon their endowments to invest in a liveable future. Faith leaders and people living on the frontline of climate change are banding together to urge their communities to divest from climate destruction. Together, all these people around the world will make one message loud and clear: it’s time to make fossil fuels history. / [http://gofossilfree.org/divestment-day/ Fossil Free]
