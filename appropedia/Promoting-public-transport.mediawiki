'''Promotion of public transport''' is promotion of better [[cities]] with better [[quality of life]], and greater [[sustainability]] and convenience for people to travel. [[Public transport]] competes with automobile-producing companies that can afford to spend large sums of money each year on advertising their products.

A report on promotion of public transport has been published by [[EMBARQ]], titled "[http://www.embarq.org/sites/default/files/EMB2011_From_Here_to_There_web.pdf From Here to There: A Creative Guide to Making Public Transport the Way to Go]."

In some countries local, regional or national governments can pay parts of the total costs of public transportation (using collected income taxes) to slightly reduce the actual ticket prices for the travellers. In Sweden this is normally up to 50% of the transport companies total costs (as long as they provide regular operation on certain routes that is beneficial for the public) <ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy#Infrastructure_subsidies</ref>
