==MOST Delta Auto Bed Leveling==
 Project developed by [[User:Erik.Wachlin|Erik Wachlin]] and [[User:lssouthe|Lee Southerton]]

==Abstract==

Bed leveling is a pain for delta style printers.  It is not intuitive, and therefore takes a long time to do.  With the addition of this auto leveling system your prints will be much better quality and leveling will take next to no time.

'''Note: This process works specifically for a printer using the following:'''
# Melzi 2.0 Board
# Repetier Host
# Arduino Firmware for Melzi

''This will allow the computer to use the same pin to read for bed leveling and for homing.''

'''BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS THOUGH BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE IT SWITCHED TO THE WRONG LIMIT SWITCH WHILE HOMING OR WHILE BED LEVELING YOU WILL CAUSE IT TO CRASH.'''

===Connecting your Z-Probe Switch===

#Using one of the homing limit switch ports, connect the z probing limit switch in series with the existing limit switch.  
##Since both limit switches should be in the normally closed setup, the loop will open if either switch is triggered.  (The firmware does not care if a home switch is thrown during z-probe and bed leveling operations.
#Once you have them connected check to see if the switches are working before  you do anything else to make sure your firmware is correct and the switches are wired properly.  
##Use the command G31 with the switch both open and closed, It should go from H to L.
###If this does not work, first check to make sure the home limit switch is not tripped (move the carriage down).
###Second check to make sure the resistance across the series goes from 0 to inf when the switch is tripped.
###If all else fails you need to check the firmware.<br><br>


===Nozzle Centering===

The nozzle must be in the true center in order for bed leveling to work for a delta style printer.  Therefore, use the following commands to put your printer at true center.

# '''G28''' -Homing the printer
# '''G131''' -Removing any extruder offsets
# '''M84''' -Turns off power to stepper motors, so that you can slide them to position on the dowel rod as shown in the gallery images.
##'''NOTE: Slide slowly so as not to generate too much electricity and break your board.'''
# After the sliders are positioned correctly type '''G132 S1''' to store the true center.

===Z-Probing===

Before bed leveling, home the machine and bring it down so that the extruder is approximately 50mm above the bed.  Moving it down eliminates interference that can happen from the endstops.  This is very important and you will get inaccurate values if you do not do this. 

Next type '''G32 S2''' which will conduct bed leveling and save the values to eeprom<br>

For the rest of the bed leveling follow the instructions [http://www.repetier.com/documentation/repetier-firmware/z-probing/ here]

'''Only follow the directions for the Delta Printer, using the dowel rod to position the bearings at exactly the same height above the bed.'''

===Resetting Values in case you make a mistake or want to recalibrate===


The eeprom is saved within Repetier Host.  It has all of the values that are received from running the auto probing system.  If you make a mistake the first time and things look very off there are multiple ways to change things.

First of all you can type '''M322''' and this will reset the offsets if those offsets are way off and you can see visually see that you need to run the z probing again.  Once you run M322, you can run the z probing again and it should fix the problem.

If you want to edit the eeprom, if you try to do it within Repetier Host the program will crash.  Therefore, export the eeprom, edit it within a text document and then import that edited eeprom and that will change all of the values.

In case your print bed is smaller than ours, you can change the locations that the printer probes by editing the eeprom.  Here is how you do it.

Here is the math to calculate locations.  They are currently set up to be at a radial distance of 80mm from the center.<br>
'''Make sure calculator is in degrees!'''
# Point 1
## X1=0
## Y1=R (Radial distance you choose)
# Point 2
## X2=R*sin(120)
## Y2=R*cos(120)
# Point 3
## X3=-R*sin(120)
## Y3=R*cos(120)


Here is how to input those values into the eeprom.
# Within Repetier Config->Firmware EEPROM Configuration-> Export EEPROM Settings
# Open up your EEPROM file and edit Z-Probing X1,Y1,X2,Y2,X3,Y3 with the values calculated above.  Use control-f to find these values and edit them.
# Save the EEPROM.
# Now go back into Repetier Config->Firmware EEPROM Configuration-> Import EEPROM Settings.

== Cost savings==
It was found that bed leveling took between 2 and 4 hours to complete. With this modification bed leveling can be done in approximately 5 minutes. This gives a time saving of more than 95% in just calibration alone. This modification also offers time savings with fewer prints that must be thrown away.
