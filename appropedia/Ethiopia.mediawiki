Ethiopia was a particpant of the United Nations Environment Programme's Climate Neutral Network

Ethiopia was the first African country to join the Climate Neutral Network. While the nation is not a net contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, it has expressed its commitment to mitigating climate change.

Ethiopia is an active supporter of UNEP's Billion Tree Campaign, contributing more trees than any other nation - over one billion - towards the global target of planting seven billion trees by the crucial UN climate change conference in December 2009. Furthermore, through Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation, the Government is distributing 5.4 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) - commonly known as "energy savers" - country-wide to help consumers save money on electricity bills and reduce their carbon footprint. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=589&ArticleID=6208&l=en&t=long United Nations Environment Programme]</ref> June 5
