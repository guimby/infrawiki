Convenor:Willow Rain

===Issues are Scattershot:===
*Understanding GP process
*Resource production with built in environmental community organization informs political process
*Concerns with process
*How GP facilitates or constrains local food systems
*How other GP processes can inform Humboldt County process
*How to improve planning process from professional perspective
*Understanding sustainable development in natural environment
===What is systems based?===
*Road networks
*Watersystems, connective element
*Soil – cycle- energy transfer
*Bio-mimicry informs systems based place (eg: effective farm is closed loop) Frank Lake’s work
===Fixes – Next Steps===
*Keep communication going
*Find common ground
*Look to other communities as models
*Emphasize conversation mode
*Apply open space model to GP
*What does system based planning mean relating to GPU?
*Seems to big to tackle
*Rivers are a reflection of our planning
*Human needs system with regard to long term plannind
===GP Issues===
*Not planning for future
*Tragedy of the commons
*Regulatory framework does not allow resource protection
*Resource use and over-use
*Length of GPU process 91/2 years – It is a living document – always being updated
*Keep all issues as relevant
*If some ideas too new or controversial to enact at present; build models to test and implement later
