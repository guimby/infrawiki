==Problem being addressed==
Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DNS) is a common complication of diabetes that affects between 40 and 60 percent of patients (DyAnsys, n.d.). It is a silent killer, which if left untreated can kill within 5 years. There is very little diagnosis of this disease in the developing world.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This device is safe, noninvasive, and uses a portable electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) hence the name ANSiscope.  It detects the percentage of autonomic dysfunction.  The initial reading takes approximately one minute to show on the device and each reading is updated after each subsequent heartbeat.  Different stages of diabetic autonomic neuropathy are indicated on the device: healthy, early, late, advanced and most advanced.  The device comes with a battery and a charger, allows for data storage on a USB and can be linked to a printer.
