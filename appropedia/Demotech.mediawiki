'''About Demotech, design for self-reliance and our invitation to participate''':

Demotech's design initiatives aim at "[http://www.demotech.org/d-design/designA.html?d=61 More joy per person]". Life has more to offer then any consumer walhalla promises. Reduction of technology and in its wake economy, can go together with the raising of its quality. Far more comfort and leisure time can be had if we only re-design technology according to appropriate technical guidelines. Not meaning this is easy. But -yes- meaning it can easily be done in an [http://www.demotech.org/d-design/designA.html?d=50 Open Source] collaborative approach. There are many examples that guide the way, but -no- such a collaborative culture joint effort still has to come into being.

Demotech's contribution consists of technical research into ultra low cost and truly sustainable technical solutions. Next to this, Demotech centers on how to get the story about such solutions across to an unwilling world, without hope or expectations that such solutions do- respectively can exist.

In search for an enjoyable sustainable world Demotech wants to draw lessons from people living in poverty. "[http://www.demotech.org/d-design/designA.html?d=63 Learning from Poverty]" is the short cut towards a sustainable society.

Proper study of the positive aspects of life in poverty that fit into the "Technology within Poverty" proves to be inspiring. To start re-design at the economic level of poverty gives the realistic framework for [[sustainability]]. Demotech found numerous options for this approach and has succeeded to get one generally accepted. We listed similar successes elsewhere.

Designs that assist these targets can be found in this group.
'''Demotech, design for self-reliance''' is a Netherlands based foundation, dedicated to [[Appropriate technology]].
