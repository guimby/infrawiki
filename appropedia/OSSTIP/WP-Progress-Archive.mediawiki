An archive of overall progress notes of WPs for [[OSSTIP]] project at different stages in time.

== 2013-07-25 (Initial) ==

(as written up after first effort to define these with BZE)

=== Main OSSTIP tasks ===

* Assessment and development of capacity in the necessary tools and data:
** [[OSSTIP/WP1- Initial data gathering and familiarisation]]: Gathering, and familiarisation, with key data requirements and possibilities;
* Evaluation and review of the tools' effectiveness given the project's goals.
** [[OSSTIP/WP2- Transit Informatics tools review]]: Assessment of key existing tools such as [[OpenTripPlanner]] given the needs of the project, see [[Open Source Transport Informatics tools]];
** [[OSSTIP/WP3- Setup and design of Spatial Data Infrastructure to support project]];
* Testing of tools to display current public transport in Melbourne:
** [[OSSTIP/WP4- Display of current Melbourne PT network in chosen tool]] (In practice, this will be quite closely integrated with previous WPs, especially [[OSSTIP/WP2|WP2]].
* Then, work out process so that a new network can be visualised:	
** [[OSSTIP/WP5- Workflow for conversion of GIS data into PT network schedule]]
 
=== BZE WPs ===

Then with each organisation, once we've developed some modifications to Melbourne's PT network (likely in an open source Desktop GIS such as [[Quantum GIS]], will do several custom further WPs based on this common base. So far for BZE these are:
* [[OSSTIP/WPBZE1- Phase 1 Display of new BZE Network in OSSTIP]]
* and to be refined decide, possibly using either the OSSTIP platform as a base for Travel zone based O-D analysis, such as in the [[Open Source Accessibility Toolkit]] project - or else supporting integrating results back in from other 3rd party tools being explored by BZE.
* Develop a web-based server to publically communicate the benefits of BZE's new network, based on the OSSTIP platform.

Possible extensions discussed with BZE:
* Supporting a 'demand-driven local service'. Simplest way to simulate this would be to allow modification of walking speeds to much higher than normal.
