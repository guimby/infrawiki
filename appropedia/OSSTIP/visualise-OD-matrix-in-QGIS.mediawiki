Looks like first I'll have to install [ GDAL] on the Mac. See http://tumblr.pauladamsmith.com/post/17663153373/howtoinstallgdalshapely .

Those seem out of date though, as the [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software:frameworks kyngchaos GDAL Mac framework] does include the Python bindings, thought they can be installed separately from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/.
