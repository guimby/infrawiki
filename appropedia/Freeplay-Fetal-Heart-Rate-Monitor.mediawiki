==Problem being addressed==
Newborn mortality accounts for over half of all infant deaths. In developing countries, where giving birth at home is common, there may be a lack of electricity to support delivery. Hand cranked heart rate monitors are more suitable for rural settings than expensive Western-derived equipment which can be difficult to repair and often rely on replaceable batteries. Discovering lowered heart rate during contractions gives medical workers a chance to suspend delivery, try to get more sophisticated medical assistance, and protect the well being of the mother and infant.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This device measures the infantâ€™s heart rate during birth. The design includes an obstetrics ultrasound device connected to the main unit by a cord. It also contains a power-management electronic module, a sound amplifier and a crank for winding up the device. This robust design is meant to withstand wear and tear.  Cranking its onboard power-supply charger for one minute provides 10 minutes of operation.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: Philip Goodwin (industrial designer), Stefan Zwahlen (electronics designer) and John Hutchinson (project leader) in Cape Town, South Africa.
*Manufacturing: This device is manufactured by Ultrasound Technologies Ltd in Caldicot, South Wales, United Kingdom. Website available [http://www.doppler.co.uk/ here].

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
This device was tested in South Africa and is now available on the market.
