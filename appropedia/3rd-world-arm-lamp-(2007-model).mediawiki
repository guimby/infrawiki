[[Image:Tube-weight plank-rope assemble.PNG|thumb|right|150px]]

Hammer the tube tight in the plank hole. 




Make the inner diameter of the tube a bit bigger, so it can move and turn smoothly around the metal-bar. 



Put the rope through the holes.

== Balance the Weight Parts  ==

<gallery caption="">

</gallery>

[[Image:Balance.GIF|thumb|right|150px]]


Balance the weight parts on the weight-plank. 



The counter balance should be in balance on both sides of the tube. 









Otherwise the tube will not slide smoothly up and down on the Metal-Bar.

== Weight Protection Box  ==
<gallery caption="">

[[Image:Plastic Jerry can.PNG|thumb|right|100px]]

[[Image:Weight protection Box.PNG|thumb|right|150px]]
A weight protection Box is made of two : (1) PE-HD or (2) PP plastic jerry cans bottoms. 

This give's de lamp stand a better design look. 

This Box give better protection to the the power supply parts like: 

Batteries, Chargers, Transformers, and other electronic parts. 

<gallery caption="">

</gallery> 











Saw or cut the top of the jerrycans. 

Melt a hole 16mm from the inside out. 

By melting from the inside out the edge of the hole is more thick curved to the outside to prevent rainwater to get in. 

One can bottom to put the power supply parts in. 

And the second to slide over first can. 

Let the electric wires go in between the can-edges.

== Brick-Weight  ==

<gallery caption="">

</gallery>

[[Image:Brick weight .PNG|thumb|right|250px]]
This is a more simple method to make a counter weight. You can use a brick in stead of the battery plank as weight. Very simple a brick with a drilled hole or Concrete with metal inside. Or two bricks in both sides of the bar. 

This one must slide en rotate smooth around and metal-bar.

This is the lamp with motorcycle batteries.








The outer-arm haves this shape because: Otherwise your fingers can get trap between the arms. 

The rubber part on the outer-arm is to keep the four arms parallel. 

The shortest-arm haves a round shape, Otherwise there is to much forces on the hole and the hammered bar. 

The shortest-arm haves a round shape, Otherwise your fingers can get trap between the arms. 

The top of the body haves this round shape because: Otherwise human fingers can get trap between the arms.

[[Image:3rd world arm lamp straight arm 2007.PNG|thumb|right|250px]]

It is possible to make a more simple stand with one straight arm.














Part P284 is for safety, without this part human fingers kan get trapped between the straight arm and the base.
