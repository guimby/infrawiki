A reflection at the closing of our gathering, in the form of ancient wisdom:

   ''Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world's grief.'' 
   ''Do justly, now.'' 
   ''Love mercy, now.'' 
   ''Walk humbly, now.'' 
   ''You are not obliged to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.''

From the Talmud
