== Project background ==
The [[CCAT_MEOW]] is a mobile renewable energy system (basically a PV system on wheels) that was designed to power local HSU and community events.  In December 2010, the MEOW was sadly vandalized and all system components were stolen (i.e. panels, inverter, battery bank, charge controller, and wiring)[[File:MEOW Theft.jpg|thumb|left|Status of the MEOW as of October 2010]].  It is likely that returning the MEOW to operating condition will be an on going project that will require the collaboration of several CCAT employees, HSU students, and community members. The purpose of this Appropedia page is to document the processes these people have taken to obtain new MEOW components and develop the new system design.
