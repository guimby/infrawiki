'''Metal joining techniques''' include:
* [[Soft soldering]]
* [[Hard soldering]]
* [[Welding]]

==Distinction==
Soft soldering is distinguished from hard soldering by use of a lower melting-temperature filler metal; it is distinguished from welding by the base metals not being melted during the joining process. In a soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and be drawn into the joint by capillary action and to bond to the materials to be joined by wetting action. After the metal cools, the resulting joints are not as strong as the base metal, but have adequate strength, electrical conductivity, and water-tightness for many uses. <ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering Soldering distinction]</ref>
