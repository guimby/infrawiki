==Abstract==
Non-tracking planar concentrators are a low-cost method of increasing the performance of traditional [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) systems. In this study such an outdoor system has been shown to improve energy yield by 45% for a traditional flat glass module and by 35% for a prismatic glass crystalline silicon module. In addition, this paper presents new methodologies for properly modelling this type of system design and experimental results using a [[bi-directional reflectance function]] (BDRF) of non-ideal surfaces rather than traditional geometric optics. This methodology allows for the evaluation and eventual optimization of specular and non-specular reflectors in planar concentration systems.
