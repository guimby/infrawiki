Dense sod can compete with new plantings. In moist climates cutting away sod for new plantings can lead to planting in low spots that collect moisture around new root crowns. A thoughtful method for creating planting sites in sod is useful.

[feel free to add your technique to the list]


== Sod Pit Planting ==

Here is an approach that involves four steps

#Scalp sod in a circle using a sharp [[Japanese hand tools|Japanese hoe]] (30 seconds).
#Loosen the circle of soil with the same hoe. (30 seconds).
#Adjacent to the circle scalp a strip and dig a pit (creating a keyhole of bare soil) piling the soil from the pit into the center of the planting circle. (30 seconds).
#Stuff the sod in the pit with organic wastes or urine. (15 seconds + urination time).

The result is an easy to plant mound of sod free soil raised above the surrounding terrain adjacent to a pit of organic material. Water running off the mound will soak in at the soil/pasture seam, with surplus going into your sod pit. You can mulch with pasture cuttings, but your investment of a couple minutes of work has bought you a year of two of competition free establishment at a favorable elevation to the surrounding terrain while avoiding movement of materials, and chunks of sod laying around to interfere with future meadow harvest.
