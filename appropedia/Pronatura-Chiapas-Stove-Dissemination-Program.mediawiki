== Stove program summary ==

===Name of stove===

Justa Plancha

===Stove description===

The design was transferred to Pronatura by the Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA) http://www.imta.mx/
This stove consists of a high efficiency combustion chamber with a plancha style cooking surface.  The design was transferred to Pronatura in June of 2004.  The original model was built with an adobe mix that was customized to each region’s available material resources.  Typical mix proportions are: 5 buckets of sand: 3buckets of earth: 0.5 buckets of cement.  Molds were originally used to form a cone shaped primary combustion chamber as specified by the IMTA design.  Pronatura is now abandoned the adobe mold method and is experimenting with bricks as the primary building material in an effort to increase the durability and lifetime of the stove.  This modification increased the cost of the stove by 41% from 56 USD to 79 USD.
