<h2>
     LaserSaur laser cutter motion components redesign and custom firmware
</h2>
<p>
     Open Source Hardware Enterprise of Michigan Technological University purchased an open source laser cutter called the "lasersaur". While the design was adequate with testing we decided to attempt improvements on the motion components of the laser cutter.
</p>



<h2>
     Reasons for the Rebuild:
</h2>
<ol>
    [[Image:SquigglyCut.jpg|thumb|left]]
    <li>
        A substantial portion of the cutting bed could be re-claimed by redesigning the components increasing the working area of the laser cutter
    </li>

    <li>
        The prior designed linear motion system presented mechanics that were easy to mis-align. The movement of the gantry would cause the bearings to slightly loosen. This caused jittering in the cuts as seen below. More severe examples exist but the stock could not be located for this documentation
     </li>

     <li>
        The far ends of the gantry were statically linked by one axle with one motor. This made it extremely difficult to get a true alignment with the gantry.
     </li>

     <li>
         For proof of concept. Similair designs for inexpensive linear motion have been implemented in a wide range of applications. Mainly for cnc mill's. This rebuild was partially under the intention of testing and displaying functionality of that implementation and appropriateness on a laser cutter.
     </li>
     
     <li>
         One of the benefits of this design is the simplicity to remove the gantry entirely in case you need to make modifications or preform maintenance.
     </li>
</ol>
<h3>
     A Note on this implementation:
</h3>
<p>
    The dynamic motion of the components used in this application were more complex and less functional then other designs. While this design works there are simpler methods of achieving the same and better results. There are elements of this design that could be greatly optimized.

<p>
     NOTE: It is a good idea to remove and store your laser tube from the chassis of the laser cutter for the entirety of the reconstruction. This will help ensure you do not accidentally damage the laser tube which is generally more expensive then the cumulative price of the other components of the laser cutter.

<ul>
     <li>
          4 x Y-Min, Y-Max Limit switches titled "LimitMount.stl"

     </li> 
</ul>


<h2>
     Remove old mechanical components from the lasersaur:
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Remove the belts driving the gantry and focusing lens carriage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the refraction mirrors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the limit switch mounts and the belt caster mounts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the stepper motors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the gantry and remaining drive components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the build platform and platform spacing mesh from the floor of the chassis.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, remove the two t-slot extruded aluminum bars that travel from the front to the back of the lasercutter inner chassis. These are located on the far left and far right sides.
    </li>
</ol>

[[Image:Lasersaur remove elements photo.jpg]]

<p>
    At this point the inside of the laser cutter chassis should contain no components other than those of the frame. No limit switches or limit switch mounting hardware, no electrical components of any kind and no 
motion hardware components of any kind. A perfect rectangle should be formed by the t-slot aluminum extrusion of the chassis frame with no interfering or protruding parts.
</p>

</ul>
<h4>
    Instructions:
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Cut your aluminum stock to the y length of the chassis. This will be around 33 and 3/4 inch length.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using a center punch and a ruler, punch drill guide points in the aluminum stock in 9 places evenly spaced across the stock. This should give you intervals between punches roughly 4 and 1/4 inch apart.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a drill with a bit as close to and slightly larger then 5mm as possible to drill out the punched locations in the stock.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the low profile 12mm m5 screws, 2 m5 washers per screw and an m5 nut (non-locking) Mount the stock to the top and bottom t-slots of both the left and right sided 80x40mm t-slot chassis frame extrusions.
Place a t-slot m5 slot nut in the rail, then a washer then a nut then a washer then the aluminum stock and thread the nut through that order of components as seen in the pictures.

</ol>



<h2>
     Solder the electronic components 
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Begin by soldering your limit switches. This will give you soldering practice for when you get to your stepper motors. Use a normally closed configuration for your limit switches. This ensures that in the case of a faulty switch a limit break will register with the control system not allowing motion. Solder a male connector to the switch. Use male connectors whenever a static component's terminals can be touched with no effect. for example with a power supply you would have the plug coming out of the psu be female because you cannot accidentally connect the power terminals. On the other end such as the control board connected to that power supply you would have male connectors since accidentally connecting the terminals of the connector is not possible if it is connected to the power supply indicating no power would be in the board and no damage possible. Use 3/32 inch heat shrink tubing to cover the solder joints. Test all your limit switches wit a multimeter by turing the function to the logical not symbol, this beeps when the two probes of the multimeter are touching each other. Connect the multi meter probes to the limit switch wires. The multimeter should make a beep when the switch is not activated or not pressed. The multimeter should stop beeping when you press the limit switch or open the circuit. Orientation of the connectors does not matter. [[Image:NOLimitSwitch.jpg|thumb]]
    </li>
    <li>
        Repeat step 1 until you have 6 functionally wired limit switches.
    </li>
    <li>
        Solder the 4 pin connectors to you stepper motors. Your stepper motors should have the same wiring color scheme as the connectors. If that is not the case, refer to the documentation for your stepper motors and stepper motor wiring color schemes for the proper configurations. Again because touching all the terminals of a disconnected stepper motor will not damage the motor in any way use a male connector
    [[Image:ConnectedStepper.jpg|thumb]]
    </li>
</ol>


<h2>
     Mount Y-Max and Y-Min Limit Switches
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
         Print 4 coppies of LimitMount.stl.
    </li>
    <li>
         Use 2 m2 x 10mm screws to mount each switch
    </li>
    <li>
         Once the limit switches are all mounted to their brackets use 2 m5 x 8mm screws and 2 5mm slot nuts to mount the brackets inside the chassis's cutting chamber
    </li>
    [[Image:YLimitHardware.jpg|thumb]]
    [[Image:MountedYLimit.jpg|thumb]]
    [[Image:MountedYLimits.jpg|thumb]]
</ol>
<p>
    It may be hard to see, but the y min/max limit switch mount brackets are backed up all the way to the cross bar stock. So the back of the bracket is as far back as possible and touching the cross bar stock.
</p> 


<h2>
     Solder, Route and Mount the static components of the laser cutter
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
         Begin by soldering cables of necessary length to connectors for the limit switches. You can use any wire as long as it is protected from signal interference. I use Ethernet cable because it is shielded.
    </li>
    <li>
         Print cable mounting brackets. If you use Ethernet cable you can print the provided cable management brackets titled "EthernetCableManagerLower.stl" and "EthernetCableManagerUpper.stl".
         [[Image:EthernetCableManagerLower.jpg|thumb]]
         [[Image:EthernetCableManagerUpper.jpg|thumb]]
     </li>
     <li>
         Each bracket uses 2 x m2x10mm screws directly screwed into the pla through the upper bracket into the lower bracket. They lower brackets are secured to the extrusion with 2 m5x8mm and 2 m5 slot nuts each. I use 3 bracket pairs per side on the under side of the main aluminum extrusions, both sides of the chassis traveling from y min to y max
         [[Image:EthernetBracket.jpg|thumb]]
         [[Image:EthernetManagementBrackets.jpg|thumb]]

     </li>
     <li>
          Next, mount the two Ethernet cables and a pneumatic tube from the y min x min corner to the y min x max corner of the cutter chassis's laser and electronics bay.
     </li>
     <li>
         Start by printing 3 of the multiple wiring and pneumatic management bracket pairs.
         [[Image:LaserBayCableManagerLower.jpg|thumb]]
         [[Image:LaserBayCableManagerUpper.jpg|thumb]]
     </li>
     <li>
         These brackets have one smaller loop on each of the pieces of the pair, make sure to orient this correctly. Use 2 m2x10mm screws to secure the top bracket to the bottom bracket, I use 4 m5 screws and m5 slot nuts to secure the paired bracket assembly to the t-slot aluminum of the laser cutter chassis in the laser and electronics bay.
