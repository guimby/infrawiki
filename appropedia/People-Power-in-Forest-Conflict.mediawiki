==Who has enough credibility to participate in forest related discussions?==

Markus looked at the UN pages. Although in theory there should be global forest UN stuff, including a year of forests there is very little on line. Many of the top people seem Finnish - though there is no ART NGOs and the civil society that is linked to on the websites seem very general or very localized. No actual chance for people to be involved in anything concrete could be found. There were no contact email working on the CFP site. Elsewhere only the heads of the org were contactable - how this meets the forest PRINCIPLES of involving women, children and youth is not clear. 

In the funding section, no rainforest nor old growth forest supporting charities were present. Instead there was a list of rapacious capitalist multinationals.

Information is very out of date - there is no calendar of events for 2010.

When looking at the jobs sections there was either nothing or very high level specializd jobs. Several mentioned volunteers / interns. BUT there was no actual description of what this involved and no chance if you happened to live outside of North America to participate in anything really.

==Global forestry and resistance against it==

*Russian CASE

Save Baikal from paper mill
Since 1966, when the mill first opened, it has been the main polluter of Lake Baikal. The mill sends about 5 tons of harmful emissions into the atmosphere annually, polluting up to 400 square kilometers of territory around Baikalsk, and builds up millions of tons of dangerous solid wastes along the shores of the lake. (Moscow TImes)

In January, Putin signed a decree to relaunch the mill , which was closed because of the financial crisis.

DIFFERENT RUSSIAN CASE - leads to civil society oppression - NB Finnish MEP speaks on case

Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament and the European Green Party
condemn in the strongest possible terms the raid by police on the offices of
the Social-Ecological Union (SEU) in the city of Samara. SEU is oldest and
largest environmental organisation in Russia and is one of the country's
most respected NGOs. This raid is just the latest example of the Russian
authorities' ongoing persecution of civil society organisations and
activists



In a joint statement, Green MEP Heidi Hautala, Chairwoman of the
Subcommittee on Human Rights and Monica Frassoni and Philippe Lamberts, EGP
Co-Spokespersons said:



"This very worrying incident shows that in spite of recent statements by
President Medvedev about his wish to see more respect for democracy and
human rights in Russia, abuses are still taking place with alarming
frequency. We must be clear about the fact that the incident in Samara took
place against the backdrop of a sweeping rollback of freedoms of expression,
association and assembly in Russia. Although the Samara City Department for
Internal Affairs have claimed that the raid on SEU's offices were part of an
"investigation related to a criminal case", SEU's representative in Samara,
Sergey Simak, has received no official information about the reason for the
raid. It can also surely be no mere coincidence that the raid occurred on
13th April, just one day after activists from Samara and 44 other cities in
Russia held protests against the felling of virgin Mediterranean
pistachio-juniper forests to make space for the construction of a health and
sports complex. "

"We join the many concerned civil society and environmental organisations
and activists both in Russia and internationally who have condemned the
actions of the authorities in Samara. We call on the authorities in Samara
to give a clear explanation of why the raid took place and demand that the
President of Russia and his government take decisive action to protect civil
society from pressure and attacks by authorities at all level. We Greens
will continue to scrutinise this case and other examples of abuses of civil
and democratic rights in Russia and call on the authorities to respect the
rights under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to
which Russia is a party. Furthermore, we urge the EU and its member states
to put pressure on Russia so that its citizens can enjoy the freedoms and
human rights that we are all entitled to. We will do this in partnership
with the EGP's Member Organisation in Russia, GROZA and Green Russia, the
EGP's Observer Organisation there. "
