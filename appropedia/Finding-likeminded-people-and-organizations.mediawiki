If you're looking for people or organizations who share your particular interests in [[sustainability and development]] related areas - [[appropriate technology]], [[solar power]], cycling or whatever your interest is - here are some ways to find people. 

It may be that you want to find people from around the world, or your own area, or you're going to a new city or country and want to find people there. 

Ways to find people:
* Browse the Appropedia [[:category:Locations|Locations category]] 
* Browse the Appropedia [[:category:Users by interest â€Ž|"Users by interest" category]] 
* [[WiserEarth]][http://www.wiserearth.org ] allows searching by interests, language, and location. 
*# Enter a country or topic name, e.g. ''Ecuador'' - this will list any organization based in that country or mentioning that country in their profile. If you only want organizations based in that country, enter ''country:Ecuador'' (replacing ''Ecuador'' with the country you want). 
*# Click "Advanced search" just above the search and you get more options to narrow it down, or can change the country. (Be careful with "Areas of focus" though - start typing, but you need to wait for a drop down list of options to appear, and select one.)
* Web search e.g. [[Google:Kuala-Lumpur+appropriate-technology]] (and search in the local language if you can)
* Look up social networks that allow you to find people by interest (and perhaps location) - [[Social networking]] lists a number of sites that might be helpful.
