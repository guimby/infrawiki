'''Piñatex''' is a leather-style fabric derived from pineapple leaves. It was invented by Spanish designer Carmen Hijosa.<ref name="G">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/21/wearable-pineapple-leather-alternative</ref>

Piñatex is a sustainable alternative to leather. It is environmentally-friendly as it uses up leaf waste that would otherwise be left to rot. It is cruelty-free, as no animals are needed. Farmers growing pineapples gain additional income for their pineapples with this new industry.

When the material is finished with, it can be composted. The by-product of producing piñatex is biomass that can be converted into fertiliser.<ref name="G" />

At the moment, piñatex is cheaper to produce than leather. It is already been used by various companies for the production of shoes, including Puma.<ref>http://www.crane.tv/pinatex</ref> As a fabric, it is easy to stitch, work with, dye and print on.<ref name="G" /> It meets numerous ISO standards for quality and durability (see the technical sheet at http://www.ananas-anam.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-the-Technical-Sheet.pdf).
