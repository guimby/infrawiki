In addition, Chiapas borders Guatemala to the southeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. Chiapas is geographically divided into five zones. These are the rainforest, the highlands, the central valley, the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and the Soconusco.

San Cristóbal de las Casas is located in the central highlands of Chiapas.  It is located at an elevation of approximately 2100 m above sea level and is approximately 50 miles away from Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas.

=== Demographics ===
Chiapas' population is about 55% Mestizo and 40% Indigenous, mostly of Maya ancestry. Around 35% of the indigenous population does not speak Spanish as a first language. Indigenous languages include Chol, Mam, Tzotzil and Tzeltal. In San Cristóbal de las Casas, the indigenous language you will hear most often is Tzotzil because of the cities proximity to the Tzotzil township San Juan Chamula. Although, as a major meeting place in Chiapas, if you wander through the extensive markets you will hear many languages. Chiapas has an area of about 73,289 km² (28,297 sq mi) and the state's population was 4,293,459 people in the 2005 census.

San Cristóbal de las Casas is the third-largest community in Chiapas, after Tuxtla and Tapachula. The municipality’s area is 484 km² (187 sq mi) and the city’s population was 142,364 people in the 2005 census. It has been long regarded as Cultural Capital of the State of Chiapas, where diverse cultural and artistic expressions abound.  In 2003, San Cristóbal de las Casas was named a "Pueblo Mágico," an honor that was renewed in 2010.

=== Recent Political Activity ===

[[File:Zap2.jpg|thumb|left|A mural in Oventik Image taken by Meghan Heintz]]
In 1994, the EZLN otherwise known as the Zapatistas, a leftist revolutionary group, declared a largely non-violent and defensive war against the Mexican state. The group is mainly comprised of indigenous rural people, but has many urban regional and international supporters. The group takes its name from Emiliano Zapata, an agrarian reformer and commander during the Mexican Revolution of 1910. While the initial uprising in 1994 utilized weapons, the effects of the superior Mexican army have caused the EZLN to select a non-violent strategy which has greatly increased their international support. Zapatista ideology synthesizes traditional Mayan beliefs with anarchist, libertarian socialist and Marxist ideas. The Abejas (the Bees) are considered a pacifist sister group to the Zapatistas because of their similar ideologies. Women's rights are especially emphasized in the Zapatista manifesto. Despite the political activity of these groups, Chiapas is considered one of the safest states in Mexico today.   <ref>Chiapas one of the top 5 safest states in Mexico according to these statistics - http://www.icesi.org.mx/estadisticas/estadisticas_encuestasNacionales_ensi6.asp</ref> 

=== Natural Setting ===
[[File:canon.jpg|thumb|right|Cañón del Sumidero Image by Jessica Lamb]]
[[File:pal.jpg|thumb|right|Palenque Image by Jessica Lamb]]
Chiapas is home to the ancient Mayan ruins of Palenque, Yaxchilán, Bonampak, Chinkultic. Palenque is possibly the most studied and written about Mayan site. Interestingly in 2010, Pennsylvania State University researchers identified a pressurized aquaduct in Palenque. This aqueduct is the earliest known plumbing in the New World and disproves the notion that the Spanish introduced water pressure systems. <ref>

</ref> The Cañón del Sumidero is also located in Chiapas. This stunning canyon which overlooks the river Grijalva is important for several reasons. It is both an important tourist attraction, a habitat for a variety of wildlife (including American crocodiles) and the source for the reservoir of the Chicoasén hydroelectric dam. 



===Economics===
Chiapas remains one of the poorest states in Mexico. GDP per inhabitant remains below half the national average (Nationally $1,500 and in Chiapas $650). Crude oil production and electricity generation from hydroelectric dams are the two main economic activities in the industrial sector. While half the population is engaged in agricultural fields producing products including coffee, papayas, mangoes and plantains. <ref>http://www.explorandomexico.com/state/5/Chiapas/economy/</ref>

===Climate===
In general Chiapas has a humid, tropical climate, but San Cristóbal is temperate with average annual temperatures of 15 °C.  The warmest month is June and with average temperature rarely exceeding 18 °C.  The coldest month is January with average temperatures under 13 °C. The rainy season lasts from May until October and average annual rainfall is more than 1000 mm.
