Dengue fever is a serious, sometimes fatal illness, which has been increasing in recent years in Indonesia. It is spread by a type of mosquito which can breeds in very small amounts of water - including rainwater captured by litter, such as discarded plastic bags. 

This project has addressed this problem in a village outside Yogyakarta, Central Java, Indonesia, through an ambitious waste management and recycling program, including changing people's habits in discarding rubbish. 

==Current status==
Very sadly, the village was mostly destroyed in the [[Wikipedia:2006 Java earthquake|May 2006 earthquake]]. Dr Iswanto is continuing to work with villages, and providing email updates to supporters in Australia.
