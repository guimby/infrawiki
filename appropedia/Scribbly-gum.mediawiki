== Description ==

The tree is named after the "scribbles" that often be seen on its smooth, white bark. These scribbles are marks made by small insects, the burrowing larvae of the moth ''Ogmograptis scribula''.<ref name="anbg" />

The leaves are narrow in shape and are coloured a greyish green.

The bark is a white to yellowish-creamy white colour. The bark is shed in patches each year and the scribbles become evident with each shedding.<ref name="anbg" />

The tree flowers annually, from December to February. The flowers are white. After flowering, gumnuts are formed. Honey eaters feed on the flowers.<ref name="anbg" />


== Growing scribbly gum ==

Grow the tree from seed or purchase a seedling from the nursery and plant from the container into the desired garden position.

Always take care when choosing the planting position, as it will shed limbs with ease.<ref name="anbg" /> Do not position it where limbs could grow over dwellings, sheds or other structures that could be damaged by a falling limb.
