==Abstract==
# In third world countries, the need for 3D printed parts that can help epople in their day-to-day life is ever growing.  For this assignment, I decided to make a pruner that someone could use to prune vegetables, shrubs, or any other organic material.  This design employs razor blades to do the cutting because of there cost and because of their availability.  Because of the low cost and also the applicability in third world countries, this project is OSAT.[[Image:Garden Pruner.JPG|200px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# 3D Printer Filament
# Files for Components [[https://www.youmagine.com/designs/garden-pruner-general-use-shears]]
# Qty (2) Standard Rectangular Razor Blades [[https://www.amazon.com/OEMTOOLS-25181-Razor-Blades-Pack/dp/B000CMFJZ2/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1480991388&sr=8-3&keywords=razor+blades]]
# Qty (1) 5/16"x1.5" bolt ($0.30 at local hardware store)
# Qty (1) 5/16"x1.5" nut ($0.08 at local hardware store)

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# 5/16" Drill Bit 
# OPTIONAL: Power Drill

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Printing Instructions
## I used PLA filament for this print and a temperature of 210 deg Celsius
## Layer Height of 0.15mm
## Print Speed of 70 mm/s
## Flow of 100%
## Estimated Print Time:  approxiamtely 3.5 hours for both components

# Assembly Instructions
## Install Razor blades into the slit in both halves  [[Image:install1.JPG|200px]]
## Install Bolt into both halves                      [[Image:install2.JPG|200px]]
## Install Nut                                        [[Image:install3.JPG|200px]]
## Estimated Assembly Time: 2 minutes



=== Common Problems and Solutions===
A problem I had was the bolt hole in the part would not print correctly so I had to turn the retraction setting in Cura off.

== Cost savings==

# Cost Estimate
## PLA:  Approximately 68 grams for both which costs $1.50
## Hardware:  $0.20 for two razor blades, $0.38 for bolt and nut
## Total of $2.58

# Commercial Equivalent-$18.97 [[https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Toughest-Friendly-Ergonomic-Effortless/dp/B0153DG8RC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481032437&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=garden+pruner&psc=1]]

# Cost Savings: $16.39 or 735% more cost effective
