Human activity may represent the greatest threat to coral reefs. In particular, coral [[mining]], [[pollution]] (organic and non-organic/chemical), over-fishing, [[blast fishing]] and the digging of [[canal]]s and access into islands and bays are serious threats to these ecosystems. Coral reef also face high dangers from pollution, diseases, destructive fishing practices and warming oceans."<ref>{cite web|author=Space Daily etal. |year=2009|title=Coral reefs tough it out against seaweed."[[science]]"</ref> In order to find answers for these problems, researchers study the various factors that impact reefs. The list of factors is long, including the ocean's role as a [[carbon dioxide sink]], atmospheric changes, [[ultraviolet light]], [[ocean acidification]], biological [[virus]], impacts of [[dust storms]] carrying agents to far flung reefs, pollutants, [[algal bloom]]s and others. Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas.

===Overfishing===
{{main|Overfishing}}
The use of [[cyanide]] has been implicated as a driver of decline. Hughes, et al., (2003), write that "with increased [[World population|human population]] and improved storage and transport systems, the scale of human impacts on reefs has grown exponentially. For example, markets for fish and other [[natural resource]]s have become global, supplying demand for reef resources."<ref>{{cite web|author=Hughes etal.|year=2003|title=Climate Change, Human Impacts, and the Resilience of Coral Reefs. ''[[Science]]''. Vol 301 15 August 2003| url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/301/5635/929|accessdate=2008-06-03 }}</ref>

Overfishing (and particularly selective overfishing) results in excessive growth of organisms that can damage the reef if they appear in great numbers. For example overfishing of bullet fish, Balistidae and other natural predators such as lobsters <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2231726.htm Controlling sea urchins with lobsters]</ref> promote the growth of sea urchins. Also, overpopulation of acanthaster planci, Drupella, Tapiro, Terpios, and Rhodactis can destroy reefs.

=====Aquarium fish=====

Although a few fish species (e.g. Pomacentridae) can reproduce in aquaria, 95% are collected on the reef. Intense harvesting, especially in South-East Asia (including Indonesia and the Philippines), severely damages the reefs. A major catalyst of [[cyanide fishing]] is [[poverty]] within fishing communities. In areas like the Philippines where cyanide is regularly used, the percentage of the population below the poverty line is 40%.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= CIA - The World Factbook -- Philippines | accessdate = 2006-11-02 | publisher=[[CIA]]}}</ref> In such [[Developing country|developing countries]], a fisherman might resort to such practices in order to protect his family from starvation.

Most, 80–90%, of aquarium fish from the Philippines are captured with [[sodium cyanide]]. This toxic chemical is dissolved in sea water and released into fish shelters. It narcotizes fish, which are then easily captured. However, most fish collected with cyanide die a few months later from liver damage. Moreover, non-marketable species die in the field.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x | title= David LECCHINI, Sandrine POLTI, Yohei NAKAMURA, Pascal MOSCONI, Makoto TSUCHIYA, Georges REMOISSENET, Serge PLANES (2006) "New perspectives on aquarium fish trade" Fisheries Science 72 (1), 40–47 | accessdate = 2007-01-16 | publisher=Blackwell Synergy}}</ref>

===Pollution===
Pollution from land-based sources is a primary cause of coral reef degradation throughout the world. <ref>http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/visions/coral/side.html</ref>

{{main|Marine pollution}}
Some nutrients favor species (such as algae, seaweed, ...) that disrupt the balance of reef communities. <ref>[http://www.globalcoral.org/Eutrophication%20and%20Water%20quality.html Eutrofication and corals]</ref> Some algae are toxic, and both plants reduce the levels of sunlight and oxygen, killing marine organisms such as fish and coral. The addition of nutrients such as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]]s are very damaging to reefs. High nitrate levels are toxic to corals, while phosphates slow down the growth of coral skeleton. Reefs in close proximity to human populations, however, will also be faced with local stresses, including poor water quality from land-based sources of pollution. <ref>http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/visions/coral/side.html </ref> Poor water quality has also been shown to encourage the spread of [[infectious disease]]s among corals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak|publisher=New Scientist|date=2004-01-11|title=Sewage nutrients fuel coral disease|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4539|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

====Organic pollutants====
=====Soil runoff=====
Extensive and poorly managed land development can threaten the survival of coral reefs. Runoff caused by farming and construction of roads, buildings, ports, channels, and harbors, can carry soil laden with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and minerals. This nutrient-rich water can cause fleshy algae and phytoplankton to thrive in coastal areas, known as [[algal blooms]], which have the potential to create [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions by using all available oxygen.

=====Windborne=====
[[Image:Barbadosdustgraph.gif|thumb|right|150px|Barbados dust graph]]
In addition to local soil runoff, additional soil (sand) is blown in from other regions. Dust from the [[Sahara]] moving around the southern periphery of the [[subtropical ridge]] moves into the [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]] during the warm season as the ridge builds and moves northward through the subtropical Atlantic. Dust can also be attributed to a global transport from the [[Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan]] deserts across [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the Northern [[Pacific]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].<ref>Duce, R.A., Unni, C.K., Ray, B.J., Prospero, J.M., Merrill, J.T. 1980.

Geochemical evidence of Saharan dust parent material for soils developed on Quaternary limestones of Caribbean and Western Atlantic islands. Quaternary Research 33:157–177.</ref>

=====Sewage=====
Another major pollutant is generated by people. Most islanders in developing countries send sewage unfiltered into the sea. While most experts now agree that [[composting toilet]] alongside an [[ecological sanitation]] approach is appropriate in small island nations, these countries for the moment prefer to keep using traditional approaches.

=====Mines=====
Inland mines of copper, gold and others form a major center of pollution. Most of the pollution is simply soil, which ends up in rivers flowing to the sea and ultimately covers the coral, but small mineral fractions may also introduce trouble. [[Copper]], a common industrial pollutant has been shown to interfere with the [[life history]] and development of coral polyps.<ref> {{cite web|author=Emma Young|year=2003|title=Copper decimates coral reef spawning|url= http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4391|accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref>

====Non-organic====
Leaked oil and chemicals (e.g. from detergents, paints, ...) flowing into the sea from factory outlets are a key threat.

Chemical [[fertilizers]] (based on ammonium nitrate) are another pollutant.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter#International_waters Litter] is another important threat, as especially in certain places (eg the Plastic Vortex), litter kills off many acquatic organisms that are directly or indirectly beneficial to coral reefs.

Radioactive waste is often dumped by the USA near its military installations (Mororua, Fangataufa, Johnston Atoll, ... Nuclear tests (eg at Kwajalein, Bikini, Enewetak) may produce harmful fallout, yet compared to the other forms of pollution noted, their impact is small.

===Climate Change===
{{main|Coral bleaching}}
[[Image:Sea urchins DSC00657.JPG|thumb|left|Corals and their enemy, the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]], at Madagascar]]
Any rise in the sea level due to climate change would effectively ask coral to grow faster to keep up. Also, water temperature changes can be very disturbing to the coral. This was seen during the 1998 and 2004 [[El Niño]] weather phenomena, in which [[sea surface temperature]]s rose well above normal, [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] or killing many coral reefs. High seas surface temperature (SSTs) coupled with high irradiance (light intensity), triggers the loss of zooxanthellae, a symbiotic algae, and its dinoflagellate pigmentation in corals causing coral bleaching. Zooxanthellae provides up to 90% of the energy to the coral host. Reefs can often recover from bleaching if they are healthy to begin with and water temperatures cool. However, recovery may not be possible if CO<sub>2</sub> levels rise to 500 ppm because there may not be enough carbonate ions present.<ref>Leahy, Stephen(2007). "Environment: Between a Reef and a Hard Place." ''NoticiasFinancieras.''</ref> Refer to Hoegh-Guldberg 1999 for more information.

Warming may also be the basis of a new emerging problem: increasing coral diseases. Warming (thought to be the main cause of coral bleaching) weakens corals. In their weakened state, coral is much more prone to diseases including [[Black band disease]], [[White band disease]] and [[Skeletal Eroding Band]]. In the event of a 2°C temperature increase, it is thought that coral is not able to adapt quickly enough physiologically or genetically<ref>P.W.Glynn "Coral Reef Bleaching: Ecological Perspectives" Earth and Environmental Science. Vol 12:1 March 1993.</ref>

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
[[File:Isidella tentaculum.jpg|thumb|[[Bamboo coral]] is an early harbinger of ocean acification]]
A related problem to climate change is ocean acidification, which can be caused by increasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

The decreasing ocean surface pH is of increasing long-term concern for coral reefs.<ref name="Kleypas, J.A. 2006">Kleypas, J.A., R.A. Feely, V.J. Fabry, C. Langdon, C.L. Sabine, and L.L. Robbins, 2006, Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Coral Reefs and Other Marine Calcifiers: A guide for Future Research, NSF, NOAA, & USGS, 88 pp.</ref>
Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the oceans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.hq.nasa.gov/oceans/system/carbon.html |title=The Ocean and the Carbon Cycle |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=2005-06-21 |work=[[NASA]] Oceanography ([http://science.hq.nasa.gov/index.html science@nasa])}}</ref> Carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the ocean reacts with water to form [[carbonic acid]], resulting in [[ocean acidification]]. Ocean surface pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14 since the beginning of the industrial era,<ref name=jacob05>Jacobson, M. Z. (2005). Studying ocean acidification with conservative, stable numerical schemes for nonequilibrium air-ocean exchange and ocean equilibrium chemistry. ''J. Geophys. Res. Atm.'' '''110''', D07302.</ref> and it is estimated that it will drop by a further 0.3 - 0.4 units by 2100 as the ocean absorbs more anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=orr05>Orr, J. C. ''et al.'' (2005). [http://www.ipsl.jussieu.fr/~jomce/acidification/paper/Orr_OnlineNature04095.pdf Anthropogenic ocean acidification over the twenty-first century and its impact on calcifying organisms.] ''Nature'' '''437''', 681-686.</ref> Normally, the conditions for calcium carbonate production are stable in surface waters since the carbonate ion is at [[supersaturation|supersaturating]] concentrations. However, as ocean pH falls, so does the concentration of this ion, and when carbonate becomes under-saturated, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution. Research has already found that corals experience reduced calcification or enhanced dissolution when exposed to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=gatt98>Gattuso, J.-P., Frankignoulle, M., Bourge, I., Romaine, S. and Buddemeier, R. W. (1998). [http://www.obs-vlfr.fr/~gattuso/jpg_papers_list.php Effect of calcium carbonate saturation of seawater on coral calcification.] ''Glob. Planet. Change'' '''18''', 37-46.</ref>

Deep sea bamboo coral supports deep sea life and also may be among the first organisms to display the effects of changes in  ocean acidification  caused by  excess carbon dioxide, since they produce growth rings similar to those of tree and can provide a view of changes in the condition in the deep sea over time. This coral is especially long-lived; coral specimens as old as  4,000-year-old were found at the Monument, giving scientists "4,000 years worth of information about what has been going on in the deep ocean interior".<ref>

===Mangroves and seagrassbeds===
Within the last 20 years, once prolific [[seagrass]]beds and [[mangrove forest]]s, which absorb massive amounts of nutrients and [[sediment]] have been destroyed. Both the loss of wetlands, mangrove habitats and seagrassbeds are considered to be significant factors affecting [[water quality]] on inshore reefs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Government Productivity Commission|year=2003|title=Industries, Land Use and Water Quality in the Great Barrier Reef Catchment - Key Points| url= http://www.pc.gov.au/study/gbr/finalreport/keypoints.html|accessdate=2006-05-29 }}</ref>

===Coral mining===
Coral mining is another threat. Both small-scale harvesting by villagers, industrial-scale mining by companies are serious threats. Mining is often done to produce construction material, and is of particular value as these rocks are up to 50% cheaper than other rocks (eg from [[quarries]]).<ref name="The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs">The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs</ref> The rocks are ground and mixed with other materials such as cement to make concrete. Ancient coral used for construction is known as "[[coral rag]]".

===Other physical destruction===
[[Blast fishing|Dynamite fishing]] is an extremely destructive method for gethering fish. Sticks of dynamite, grenades, or home-made explosives are simply thrown in the water. This method of fishing kills the fish within the main blast area, along with many inedible and/or unwanted reef animals. The blast also kills the corals in the area, eliminating the very structure of the reef, destroying the habitat for fish and other animals important for the maintenance of a healthy reef.<ref name="McClellan">McClellan, Kate and Bruno, John (2008) [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Coral_degradation_through_destructive_fishing_practices ''Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices''] Encyclopedia of Earth. Retrieved [[25 Oct]] [[2008]].</ref>

Other types of fishing like [[muro-ami]] and [[kayakas]] kills all fish in certain areas, causing havoc on the ecosystem of the reef.<ref name="McClellan"/>

Boats and ships require an access point into bays and islands to load/unload cargo/people. For this, often parts of the reef are chopped away to clear a path. Although this seems but minor destruction of the reef, potential negative consequences include altered water circulation and altered tidal patterns, which then cause a turnaround in the reef's supply of nutrients; sometimes destroying a great part of the reef.

Fishing boats and other large vessels occasionally run aground on a reef. Two types of damage can result.  Collision damage occurs when a coral reef is crushed and split by a vessel's hull into multiple fragments. Scarring occurs when boat propellers tear off the live coral and expose the skeleton. The physical damage can be noticed as striations in the reefs.

[[Mooring]] also causes considerable damage. To reduce the (considerable) amount of devastation, boats can use [[mooring buoy]]s. They are available in most major wetparks and marine sanctuaries. Most buoys are of the [[Halas Mooring Buoy System]]-type. <ref>[http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jan03/noaa03r402.html Mooring Buoys to reduce coral reef devastations]</ref>

[[Construction]] also takes its toll. Building directly on the reef can alter water circulation and tides (which bring the nutrients for the reef). The main reason for building on reefs (despite possible moisture problems) is simply the lack of space.
