==Problem being addressed==
Women in developing nations often do not have access to contraceptives, and in the case that they do, may find it difficult to adhere to tedious guidelines on a regular basis.  Essentially, there is a need for easy-to-use, cost-effective contraceptives that do not require regular maintenance or effort.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This innovative drug delivery system is a subcutaneous biosynthetic bone-like material made of calcium minerals that, once implanted, can deliver contraceptives at regular intervals in a sustained manner for several months.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: This device is currently being developed by GÃ©rrard Poinern of Murdoch University in Australia.
*Manufacturer location: Murdoch University in Perth, Australia

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
A research group is currently developing the technology to be feasible, and if successful, will collaborate with a drug company to begin human trials.

==Funding Source==
This device received funding from the Grand Challenges Exploration Grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
