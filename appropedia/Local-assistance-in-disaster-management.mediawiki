== Early action is critical ==

When a disaster strikes, the loss of life is largely in the first two or three days.

local people often mobilize and respond to a disaster well before authorities and [[foreign aid agencies]].

== Challenges faced by international agencies ==

* International groups have to make an assessment of needs before deciding how to help.
* Their workers are often delayed while obtaining visas, then traveling to the affected country.
* Imported relief supplies and equipment are often automatically taxed. Obtaining an exemption leads to delays.

Thus international help will be very limited in the time that help is most needed 

== Funding ==

While campaigns by local media raise money, often in the very beginning of the disaster, international relief agencies receive most of the media attention and donor funding.

== Local action ==

It is the people living in the damaged areas who save the most lives. They also help survivors long after foreign aid workers leave, as this is the area where they live, and where they have a strong connection and commitment.
