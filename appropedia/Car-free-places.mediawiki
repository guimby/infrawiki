'''Car-free places''', or '''pedestrian zones''', are an essential part of a [[city]] - not only for [[sustainable city living]], but to create a peaceful, desirable place to be.

In these areas, some or all automobile traffic is prohibited. 

Other types of zones, i.e. [[mixed zones]]{{fact}} allow vehicles, but they must negotiate their way with pedestrians, making a different kind of place from traditional roads.
