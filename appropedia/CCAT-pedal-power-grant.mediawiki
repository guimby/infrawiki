==The Pedal Power Grant==

[[Image:Grant1.jpg]]

Danial Poten, Steve Sakala and Bart Orlando authored a $10,000 grant proposal for [[pedal power]] projects on behalf of [[CCAT]]. The grant proposal was submitted to the Foundation for Sustainability and Innovation in 1998. $5,000 was awarded to CCAT. With that money, Bart Orlando, (with the assistance of HSU students and CCAT staff), built the pedal power concert generator, the pedal powered tv/vcr and the cabinets for the pedal power lab.
