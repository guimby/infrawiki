A tablecloth is useful to have for covering a table, bench or other built structure suitable for eating from. It can also be used to drape over grass, ground or other areas that you decide to sit down and eat at.

Tablecloths are very easy items to sew by hand or machine, especially square and rectangular ones. All you need is fabric (which can be new or repurposed from clothing/sheets/blankets/scrap material, etc.) and thread, a needle or machine and some scissors. If you want to add a decorative edging, add that into the mix too.

== Measuring for a basic tablecloth ==

Assuming you're using a table first, measure the table to know how large to make the tablecloth

# Measure both length and width of the table.
# Once you have done that, choose the amount of overhang for the tablecloth. This is up to you, but once you've decided it, add twice this amount to the width and the length.
# Add in a hem allowance. This should usually be about 5cm or 2.5 inches. If you're going to add decorative edging, then skip the hem amount.

== Making a tablecloth ==
=== Getting sufficient fabric ===

Depending on the size of the tablecloth needed, you may need to join fabric pieces together, so if this is the case, now is the stage to do so. If you do join the fabric pieces together, ensure that the seam joins are on the sides/edges and nowhere near the middle of the cloth when it is positioned on the table. The best piece should be the part that shows on the table top, the sides can be less neat/interesting. Don't forget the seam allowance when making the fabric larger.

=== Adding seams to the tablecloth ===

If you need to make joins, use neat seams to do so. If you don't need to add seams, you can skip these directions and go to hemming.

# Cut the fabric pieces to size. Use flat-fell seams to join the widths if needed and press the seam allowances on one side of the fabric.
# Trim the underlying seam to 6mm or 1/4 inch. Fold the top allowance back over the the trimmed seam. Turn the raw edge in to cover the trimmed seam. Pin to hold in place, then iron to hold.
# Sew the hem in place, either by hand or with machine stitching. If you use a nice stitch, the stitching can show on the outside of the tablecloth (right side up).

=== Adding a hem to the tablecloth ===

Decide whether to stitch by hand or machine stitch. Fine fabrics are best stitched by hand, while most other fabrics are fine done by machine sewing.

Fold or roll over the edges about 1/4 inch to 6mm in from the raw edge so that you can't see the raw edge any longer. Rolling works best. Pin in place and press. Then sew down the hem to keep in place, ensuring to keep a straight edge.

It is important to press in a straight line to keep the hem in place, so that the end result is straight.

Corners can be mitred but only if you know how and wish to do so.

== Adding decorative elements ==

This isn't necessary but you might like to embellish your tablecloth with embroidery designs or print. If using embroidery, draw a design on using a fabric pen first, to have something to follow. For printing, use fabric paints and stencils. If you want to sew on lace, buttons, etc., ensure that they won't interfere with placing down dishes and utensils.

== Fabrics suitable for making tablecloths ==

Good fabrics include: Linen, cotton, cotton-polyester blends, etc. Hardier fabrics such as blanket wools or soft furnishing fabrics need to be tested for flexibility and good fit before sewing. With blanket fabric, use blanket stitch to create the hems.

Old tablecloths with unmovable stains can be repurposed by cutting the good parts away from the stains and stitching together using seams to form a new tablecloth.

== Finding ready-made tablecloths ==

If you don't want to stitch, you can just cut a large piece of cloth but remember that it will likely fray with use and washing. You could also repurpose such items as large scarves or pashminas, baby/child sheets or larger sheets, old blankets (great if you're doing any craft work requiring a soft surface), duvet covers, etc. Any large piece of square or rectangular fabric can be repurposed as a basic table cloth.
