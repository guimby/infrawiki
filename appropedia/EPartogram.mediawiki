==Problem being addressed==
Maternal death rates are often high in resource-poor settings because of inefficient and inaccurate labor assessment and delayed complication management.  The paper partogram, although a useful tool for monitoring and assessing the progress of labor, remains cumbersome and time-consuming. 

==Detailed description of the solution==
The ePartogram is an affordable, easy-to-operate, efficient and comprehensive electronic alternative to the paper partogram. It is a hand-held device that allows for more efficient recording of clinical observations, more accurate predictions of complications, and more rapid decision-making. It includes a sensor module for partial automation of data collection and a telemedicine module that allows midwives to obtain support and guidance from distant senior-level clinicians. Thus, the ePartogram supports front-line workers and brings essential services to women.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: Jhpiego Corportion, Johns Hopkins University Center for Bio-Engineering Innovation and Design, Laerdal Global Health
*Manufacturer location: Baltimore, Maryland, USA

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
Lab or bench testing will take place mainly in Baltimore, MD, while field testing is likely to take place in Kenya.
