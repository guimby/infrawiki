{{topic header| default.png | Licenses }}

Choosing a license for your content is important for [[knowledge sharing]]. Under the Berne Convention{{w|Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works}} work in most countries is automatically copyright, which restricts knowledge sharing. 

You can actively release some of your rights, and this surprisingly easy to do by using a license that already exists. [[Creative Commons]] licenses are the most popular licenses for open content and media. The [[GPL]] is popular license for [[open source software]].
