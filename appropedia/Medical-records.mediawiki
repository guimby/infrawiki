== Problem ==
 
"The need for an easy and concise health record system that 
requires little or no experience with filing methods." [1] 



== Summary ==
 
"The system described in this manual will 
help avoid excessive paper work and duplication and, 
at the same time, provide a system of constant flux 
and recall. 
Because there are so many variables present in 
each medical application, this manual is not designed 
as a definitive answer to problems. -Instead, it is 
hoped that the suggested methods can be adopted or 
modified to meet any situation." This paper includes this great idea for pulling selected records; "cards are stacked with the cut corners lined up and 
a knitting needle, long pin, or wire is inserted through 
the given district hole. The cards are juggled and 
shaken on the needle and all the cards of that given district (i.e., those notched) fall out."[1]
