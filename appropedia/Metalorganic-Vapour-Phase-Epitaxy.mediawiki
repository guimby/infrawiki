Metalorganic Vapour Phase Epitaxy- is a method of creating controllable epitaxial layered structures by atomic deposition over a substrate material.  A substrate wafer is placed on a graphite susceptor and heated in a reaction vessel.  Compounds are grown in a hydrogen atmosphere and then form epitaxial layers on the substrate as they decompose.
