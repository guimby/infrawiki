A '''radiative heater conversion''' is the conversion of the heat source of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiator Radiative heater]. Radiative heaters are composed of the heat exchanger connected to a water tank, heated by a heat source. This heat source can be coupled before the tank or inside it (in the boiler). A radiative heater conversion converts that exact heat source in order to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from the device, and in order to make the resupplying of the fuel for the device [[self-sufficient]].

==Conversions==
===Fossil oil to electric heat source conversion===
A fossil oil to electric heat source conversion is done in two possible ways, depending on whether the heat source is coupled in front or inside of the boiler.

When the heat source is coupled in front of the boiler:
* the separate heat source is discarded and a electric heater is installed inside the water tank

When the heat source is coupled inside the boiler:
* the heat source is removed from the boiler and an electric heater is placed in instead. 

==Material salvaging==
If the heat source was coupled in front of the boiler, often the unit needs to be discarded completely from the system. However some heaters as (fossil) oil heaters often include parts that can be salvaged for use in other machinery. examples are the pump, sprinklers, bolts, washers, gears, fans and electrical wiring.
