*[https://www.tamera.org/index.html Tamera Healing Biotope I]
Tamera is a peace research village with the goal of becoming "a self-sufficient, sustainable and duplicable communitarian model for nonviolent cooperation and cohabitation between humans, animals, nature, and Creation for a future of peace for all." It is also often called a "healing biotope". Literally translated, "biotope" simply means a place where life lives. In Tamera, however, "healing biotope" is also described as a "greenhouse of trust", "an acupuncture point of peace", and "a self-sufficient future community". It is located on 335 acres (1.36 km2) in the Alentejo region of southwestern Portugal. {{W|Tamera}}
