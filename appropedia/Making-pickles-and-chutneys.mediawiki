'''Pickling''' and '''chutney making''' are both methods that use [[vinegar]] to [[Food_preservation_and_storage|preserve food]]. 

Pickling is done with whole fruit or vegetables<ref>even eggs can be pickled which is neither</ref>. These are soaked in brine (or alternatively [[Curing|salted]]) for 24 hours and are then put in vinegar (at ambient temperature) in sterilized jars.

Chutney uses cut fruit or vegetables which are cooked in vinegar (often with spices as cumin, coriander, allspice, pepper, mustard seed, ...).<ref>Practical self-sufficiency by Dick and James Strawbridge</ref> Chutneys therefore do not require curing as a first step. When put in sterilized jars for storing, make sure the chutney is still very hot when pouring it in, and make sure there is as little air left as possible in the jar. See [[canning]].
