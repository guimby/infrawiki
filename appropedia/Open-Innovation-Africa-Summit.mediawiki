==Open Innovation Africa Summit ==

The premise of the Summit is that innovations in products, services, business models and processes can lead to greater social and economic wealth creation in Africa. However, today barriers stand in the way for this potential to be realized. The Summit aims to promote the creation of new innovation services and collaboration models, which align the public and private sector stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem and embeds end-user driven co-creation and open innovation as critical elements to African innovation systems.

The site revolves around the four main streams of interest and focus for the summit:

*Ecosystem for Innovation
*Emerging Market Business Models
