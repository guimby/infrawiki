Polarization is a process in which rays of light show different properties in different directions. Especially in the state in which all the vibration takes place in one plane. A light wave is an [[electromagnetic]] wave which travels through this plane. These light waves are produced by vibrating [[electric charge]]s. The electromagnetic wave is a transverse wave which has both an electric and a magnetic component.
