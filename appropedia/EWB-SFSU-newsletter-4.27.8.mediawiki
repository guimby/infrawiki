The Masters of International Student's Association at San Francisco State University will be holding a conference on April 26th and 27th, Saturday and Sunday which promises to equip young leaders with the tools and networks to become foreign policy leaders and promoters of an interconnected world. The conference will be held in the HSS Building.  You must register early if you want to attend www.aidemocracy.org/conferences/gps/ssf08.php 

===Tiny Tickets===
EWB-SFP, the local professional chapter, is working with BART to raise money.  To contribute, bring your unwanted BART tickets (with 25 and 30 cents on them) to the EWB tack board in the Science Building of SFSU and drop your ticket into the envelope.  EWB-SFP managed to raise $5000 last year, so drop your ticket to help them out.
