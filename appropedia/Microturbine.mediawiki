A microturbine is a form of [[combined heat and power]] or [[distributed generation]] system. It burns natural gas or other fuel to create electricity, but you can also utilize the waste heat. Microturbines have the lowest [[emissions]] of any non-catalyzed fossil fuel combustion from burning natural gas. 

==Efficiency==
Some microturbines can achieve 80% efficiency as compared to only 35% efficiency from the conventional grid.

They are basically jet engines in a box. Loud!!!
