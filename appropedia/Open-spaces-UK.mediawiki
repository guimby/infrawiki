== Green Pennant Award ==

The Green Flag Award itself is for public-run open spaces, but the same scheme runs an award for community/charity-run public spaces, such as Millennium Greens and Doorstep Greens called the Green Pennant Award. This scheme, started in 2002, has adapted the criteria for voluntary organisations.  

Sites for a Green Pennant Award are judged against eight key criteria: {{W|Green_Flag_Award#Green_Pennant_Award}}

* A welcoming place
* Healthy, safe and secure
* Well maintained and clean
* Environmental sustainability
* Biodiversity and heritage
