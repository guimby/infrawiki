==Problem being addressed==
In the absence of appropriate interventions, low birth weight infants are at increased risk for illness, developmental delay and death. Identifying low birth weight children in resource-poor settings requires an inexpensive, accurate and portable scale that can be understood with minimal literacy or training.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The BIRTHweigh III is a portable handheld non-electronic scale that uses a plastic spring to gauge low birth weight status among newborns. Based on WHO cutoff weights and using color codes, the scale categorizes newborns into normal (>2500 g) birth weight, low (2000-2499 g) birth weight, and very low (<2000 g) birth weight. The three-way classification also has applications for correct dosing of antibiotics to newborns.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), PO Box 900922 Seattle, WA 98109
*Manufacturing: PATH is working to identify manufacturers in the countries where the technology is most needed.

==Implementation ==
A licensed version is currently for sale worldwide through Unicef under the name BeBeWay.

==Funding Source==
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides public funding.
Save the Children provides philanthropic funding.
