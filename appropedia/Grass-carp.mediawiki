Grass carp will usually require a one-time introduction and cost as opposed to repeated annual chemical applications. Grass carp will not deplete oxygen and do not muddy the water as do common carp. They are capable of eating two to three times their weight in plants each day and may gain 5 to 10 pounds in a year. May be illegal to possess diploids or any grass carp in some places in the United States.
