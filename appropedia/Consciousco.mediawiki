[http://consciousco.co/ The Conscious Commerce] mission is to create a guide for conscious living by promoting the causes, brands, people and lifestyles that are forging a new paragon of living.

The company selects purposeful products that they think consumers would buy anyway and organizes them along with introducing them to role models (e.g. the direction of cool, ethically sound businesses). They have also paired some  brands with small, locally run organizations, to create limited edition products to bring together consciousness and commerce.

 "It can seem impossible to eat, shop, travel, or bathe without somehow destroying Earth and most of its inhabitants.
 Maybe if we all take small steps in the right direction, we can at least avoid being the assholes ensuring total world annihilation."
