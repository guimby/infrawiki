==Problem being addressed==
Post-partum hemorrhage is the cause for 8% of direct pregnancy-related deaths in
industrialized countries and 25% of maternal deaths in the developing world. In trauma
patients, hemorrhagic shock is the second most frequent cause of death.
==Detailed description of the solution==
The external aortic compression device, also known as the EACD, consists of a strong
metal spring, cylindrical in shape, covered with leather. It has a height of 12 cm (5 cm
when compressed), diameter of 8 cm, and a net surface area of 22.3 cm2. It is fixed in
place by a leather belt wrapped around the waist. When not in use, it is held compressed
and fixed with Velcroâ„¢ straps. When the straps are released the spring will open and
the desired pressure (103.5 mm Hg/cm2 (30 kg)) on the abdominal wall is achieved in
order to stop bleeding.
