Kvass (квас in Cyrillic) is a fermented, slightly alcoholic drink that is popular in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia, as well as some Central Asian countries. The drink, like many other fermented foods and beverages, is touted for its healthy properties and is consumed by all ages. The base is generally rye bread, which is fermented with sugar and a yeast culture.
