==Assignment==
# Identify scientific/engineering lab need on campus for a 3D printable substitute for existing or planned purchase
# Meet with users to determine exact needs/acquire additional funds/components for multipart equipment
# Design 3D printable components with OS CAD packages
# Open [http://3dprint.nih.gov/ NIH 3DP] account and post STL, '''include all source files from OS CAD package, directions, explanation of what it is and a price estimate for a commercial equivalent''' (can use Appropedia page for directions and main host if easier)
# Print component and bring to class
# Add picture and link to NIH in gallery and "savings per replica" and a hyperlink to cost source on Appropedia below.
