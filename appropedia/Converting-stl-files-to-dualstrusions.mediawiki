If you have access to a 3-D printer with two heads you can do dual extrusions. A good example of how to turn an STL file into a dualstrusion merged stl file is with MOST's [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21164 SunHusky Logo]

To make use of this functionality to do the following:
# create the first object
# import into [[OpenSCAD]] 
# make it a module
# create second object in OpenSCAD - e.g. the frame or housing
# Difference them by
# save the inverted stl
# open ReplicatorG, click GCode, click merge .stl for Dualstrusion
# set up choices for each one (recommend identical)

==Example OpenSCAD script==

 difference(){
 cylinder(5,60,60);
 sunhusky();
 }

 module sunhusky(){
 import("sunhusky3d.stl");
 }
