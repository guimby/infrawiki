Keys to avoiding/mitigating '''urban heat islands''':
* Keep roofs a lighter color (building codes, paint. An [[environmental impact assessment]] is needed to compare the net effects of painting with leaving as is.{{sp}})
* Keep roads a lighter color - choosing a lighter color of bitumen or concrete (provided it's not so bright that it causes excessive glare for drivers).
* Higher, [[multi-level buildings|multi-level]] [[buildings]], interspersed with green areas, rather than low rise sprawl with a majority of [[hard surfaces]]. This is also preferable in terms of water permeability (see also [[Permeable pavements]]) avoiding excess [[stormwater]] runoff, and thus having better [[groundwater recharge]].)
* [[Vegetation]] covering most of the land surface
* [[Green roofs]] - provided the extra weight doesn't mean excessive [[embedded energy]].
* [[Green walls]]
