Braiding leads is optional but will facilitate both cable management and printer maintenance. It is therefore recommended. Braiding is most easily accomplished after all of the motors are attached to the frame.

A good video instruction may be found in the info box. Do not twist the wires while laying them atop each other as it will make the process more difficult and will also damage the conductors. While braiding the leads, after every cycle of overlaying left to right pull a finger through a pair of leads to minimize tangling. The braid is relatively stable.
