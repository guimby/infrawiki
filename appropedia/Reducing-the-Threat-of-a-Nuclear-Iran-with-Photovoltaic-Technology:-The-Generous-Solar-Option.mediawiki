==Abstract==

The potential instability created if Iran obtained nuclear weapons threatens global peace. If the U.S. follows the standard model, relatively weak diplomacy and economic sanctions could lead to another Iraq-like war. Although Iran and Iraq have differences, most observers would agree that the same outcome and price are likely results. In purely economic terms, the CBO estimates that the Iraq-US war cost ~$2.4 trillion.  Is there, however, a wiser, more-profitable way to invest in the elimination of nuclear capability in Iran? This commentary will quantify the 'generous solar option' and argue that the U.S. can obtain all the benefits from denuclearizing Iran for a fraction of the cost of the standard model, while earning a higher return and improve environmental impact in the process.
