==Impact on the Community==

Bicycles offer various  benefits:
*Bike paths are cheaper than roads, and as well as gas
*leads to better health, meaning lower medical costs 
:*leads to better physical health (less stressful and more enjoyable)
:*Exercise improves one's mental state.
*Allows for a community member to be able to get to work, school and other places they. They will be able to make connections increasing their social life.


==As a means of personal transport==
Even areas with just footpaths bicycling is the most energy-efficient means of transport generally available.  Bicycling at low to medium speeds (10-15 mph, 16-24 km/h), uses only the energy required to walk.


==Cost==
Bicycles and helmets are still expensive. Therefore, transport needs to be supported by an affordable system of manufacture, supply, and repair.

In order for community members to be able to bike their needs to be spare parts and repair services, which are
affordable. Bike Rodeo allows for safety, maintenance, and repair to allow the transportation.
