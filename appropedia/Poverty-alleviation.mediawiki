{{topic header| default.png | Poverty alleviation}} 

'''Poverty alleviation''' is complex and challenging, but has been achieved, and can be achieved through many approaches. Key warnings must be heeded, however. [[Poverty]] can be persistent over many generations, but it can also be reduced in severity in just a few years, given the right context and [[appropriate]] action.

There is no single panacea - typically a range of tools should be used, or (in the spirit of [[community participation]]) at least offered to the those we are trying to help.

== Key tools for fighting poverty ==

(Please give sources where possible to show that the listed tools are proven and/or acknowledged as effective against poverty.)
* [[Education]]
* Financial approaches:
** [[Financial literacy]]
** [[Conditional Cash Transfer]]
** [[Microfinance]]
* Support for [[microenterprises]]{{fact}} - e.g. programs using or selling [[appropriate technologies]]. Only a few very clear examples exist, such as the [[Kick Start]] [[treadle pump]] program. (Other successful examples may exist, but it is in the [[principles of appropriate technology|nature of appropriate technology]] that it may only be applicable in a specific context - while treadle pumps have been broadly effective, it is possible that other successful programs may be helpful in only a small area.)
 
== Warnings ==

* [[Subsidies]] can be damaging to initiative, punish risk-takers, and encourage a kind of [[welfare dependence]].
