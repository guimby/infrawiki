With more than a hundred attorneys in offices across the country, Earthjustice pursues three key goals to secure a just, flourishing world:

THE WILD
Our nation’s laws protect the magnificent natural spaces and wildlife we have inherited from previous generations. Earthjustice enforces those laws to protect what we know to be irreplaceable wildlife and wild places, for this and future generations.

HEALTHY COMMUNITIES
We fight for a future where children can breathe clean air, no matter where they live; where products in our homes are free of toxic chemicals; and where all communities are safer, healthier places to live and work.

CLEAN ENERGY & A HEALTHY CLIMATE
Earthjustice’s legal victories strengthen the rise of clean energy, laying the groundwork for the systemic change we must see. At stake is nothing less than our children’s—and our planet’s—future.
