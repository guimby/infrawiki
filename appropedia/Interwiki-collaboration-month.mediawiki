'''Interwiki collaboration month''' is a proposal originating from  the Sustainable Community Action wiki to promote and encourage interwiki collaboration on any aspect of sustainability or [[sustainable development]].

=== When? ===
* '''June, each year, starting in 2009'''

Plenty of time to prepare, fits in with green festivals (summer months, northern hemisphere - see note below), might fit in well with one of proposed topics for 2009 

=== What? ===
The idea is to collaborate on expanding a common pool knowledge from which everyone can share on one or a few main topics each year

*June 2009 proposal - something like 'Low carbon futures' or 'How can we reduce our carbon footprint' - which might fit in well with the lead up to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, COP-15 (November 2009)

=== Why? ===
* Collaboration is a good thing!
* if a whole range of wiki can be seen to be working together this may be more impressive to potential users, and so used in promotion of individual wiki to wider audiences
* low cost - only commitment is to collaborate on at least one topic on at least one wiki (preferably including at least one different to that which normally contribute to) during the month

==== Alternative titles ====
*Peoples' Sustainability Symposium

=== Who? ===

Original proposal posted on the first 5 wikis, but of course the list can be added to:

(not intended to be a northern hemisphere / developed world only thing, but specifically to try and include or be open to majority world / developing world also)

== Responses ==
We'll definitely be interested. Keep an eye on the [[OSN]] and planned [[OSNCamp]]s too - we could probably merge them. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] 09:50, 4 November 2008 (UTC)
