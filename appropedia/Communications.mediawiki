Communication comes from Latin and means "to share".
Communication is a way to interact with other people, exchange ideas, information and so on. Machines also communicate with humans (H2M) and machines communication with each other (M2M). Unlike humans, computers and gadgets can be connected to each other through wireless networks and via radio links such as Wifi. For long distance people used to send post, but life has become much easier with the development of technology.
Communication can be divided into various sections.
4000 years B.C. people used hieroglyphics to communicate. Now we use mobile phones and we are accessible anywhere there is reception. The internet has enabled a communication explosion.


== Dissemination of internet communication  ==
 
The precurser to the Internet was invented in 1969. The first civilian use was for connection with universities. The original aim was to ensure secure communications in the event of war. In 1997 around 121 million people worldwide used the Internet. Today they are around 2,925 million people who are online. Many use different social networks for communication. The most common social network is Facebook with 1,276 million registered users.

== Communication changes with technology ==

New technology and social media sites are constantly changing, evolving and developing, which means the face of personal communication is also changing. These changes, unfortunately often mean people are having less and less face-to-face interactions.

Email, texting, Facebook and Twitter are just a few examples of media that have diminished verbal communication; verbal communication has decreased dramatically from just 20 years ago, when most of the technology used today did not even exist.

== Body Language (a way of communication)==

When we interact with others, we continuously give and receive wordless signals. All of our nonverbal behaviour — the gestures we make, the way we sit, how fast or how loud we talk, how close we stand, how much eye contact we make — send strong messages. These messages don't stop when you stop speaking either. Even when you're silent, you're still communicating non-verbally.

Oftentimes, what comes out of our mouths and what we communicate through our body language are two totally different things. When faced with these mixed signals, the listener has to choose whether to believe your verbal or nonverbal message, and, in most cases, they're going to choose the nonverbal because it's a natural, unconscious language that broadcasts our true feelings and intentions in any given moment.


== USB Cable ( Universal Serial Bus)==


Communication can be divided into various sections. Humans communicate through computers and smartphones whereas machines can also communicate with each other through USB-cables.
In 1980 transmission of data was really a difficult work and took a lot of time of engineers. Then, some of famous companies came together and decided to create a wire, which would make their work easy and could be also sold in order to make more money. In those days, computers were made with USB ports, so that wire cold connect to computers through socket and port. The 1st USB was introduced in early 1990s and Windows 98 was the 1st window to support it. There are 3 types of USB Cables. The difference between them is their speed.  The 1st USB cable can transfer data at up to 12 megabits per second (Mb/s). It was replaced in 2000 by USB 2.0, which has a peak transfer rate of 480 megabits per second (Mb/s). The 3rd USB Cable (USB 3.0) has a speed rate of 16 gigabits per second (Gb/s).



== Wireless Networking ==

Wireless networking is a type of communication for networked computers, printers and other devices. They can join a network without a cable. This is attractive for homes, business installations and telecommunication networks. Wireless networks are also used to build up connections between devices in different locations. It is cheaper as a local area network. In homes we can connect all our communication devices, like computers and printers, to each other.  Business installations use wireless networks to connect all of their computers with each other, even when they are in different locations. A wireless telecommunication network is generally used for the radio communication.

===Types of Wireless networks===
====Wireless PAN====
Wireless PAN (personal area network) are small networks. This area is generally in a persons reach. Connecting System wich use WPAN are for example Bluetooth and invisibel infrared ligths. WPAN is often used to connect headsets with a computer.

====Wireless LAN====
A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a wireless network which links devices within a small area, but a bigger area than PAN. The LAN area is limited to an home, a school, an office or something similar. In a WLAN network the users are able to move with there devices without a connection lost. Most WLANs are based on the Wi-Fi standards. 
WLAN has become popular in homes and in business which offer their customers a wireless access.

== Social-Media ==

Because social media is such a broad term, it covers a large range of websites. 
But the one common link between these websites is that you are able to interact with the website and interact with other visitors.

Here are some examples of social media websites:

* Social Bookmarking. (Del.icio.us, Blinklist, Simpy) Interact by tagging websites and searching through websites bookmarked by other people.
* Social News. (Digg, Propeller, Reddit) Interact by voting for articles and commenting on them.
* Social Networking. (Facebook, Hi5, Last.FM) Interact by adding friends, commenting on profiles, joining groups and having discussions.
* Social Photo and Video Sharing. (YouTube, Flickr) Interact by sharing photos or videos and commenting on user submissions.
* Wikis. (Wikipedia, Wikia) Interact by adding articles and editing existing articles.
And these websites are not the only social media websites. Any website that invites you to interact with the site and with other visitors falls into the definition of social media.

== Instant messaging ==
Instant messaging (IM) is a type of communications service that enables you to create a kind of private chat room with another individual in order to communicate in real time over the Internet, analogous to a telephone conversation but using text-based, not voice-based, communication. Typically, the instant messaging system alerts you whenever somebody on your private list is online. You can then initiate a chat session with that particular individual.

Instant messaging services:

* Facebook (Facebook Messenger, Instagram, [http://www.77whatsappstatus.in WhatsApp Status])
* Tencent Holdings Limited (WeChat, Tencent QQ, Qzone)
* Google (Google+ and YouTube users (merging))
* Microsoft (Skype and Windows Live / MSN messenger (merged))
* Twitter (API)
* LinkedIn (API)

== cell phones ==

A cell phone is any portable telephone which uses cellular network technology to make and receive calls. The name comes from the cell-like structure of these networks. There is some confusion about cell phones being a different thing to smartphones, but technically, every mobile phone, from the latest Android handset to the simplest feature phone, is a cell phone. It is all about the technology used to transmit your calls, rather than what the handset itself can or cannot do. As long as a phone can transmit a signal to a cellular network, it is a cell phone.

The term Cell Phone is interchangeable with the terms Cellular Phone and Mobile Phone. They all mean the same thing. The term Smartphone has come to mean a cell phone which offers more advanced features than just calls, SMS messages and basic organizer software. Often, when talking about mobile phones, cell phone is used to describe a simple feature phone, whilst smartphone is used to describe more advanced touch screen phones

Communication is the exchange of messages or information between people.
Electronic gadgets like the mobile phone change our world. Nowdays communication between people is much more easily than before.

Humans from different countries or even different continents can communicate with each other by the cell phone.
They also can work with their mobile phone without leaving their home or actual position.

In the past people communicate with letters, so they have to wait over several days for the written letter till they get it.
In the past it was difficult to find someone quickly so they have to search a long time.
Nowdays, almost every person owns a mobile phone, so with just one call you are able to tell your message or find out where the person is.

All in all the way to communicate with other people is nowadays much easier thank technological advances.


== Internet ==

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks to link several billion devices worldwide.
Through websites like Twitter, Facebook, icq chat etc. people can stay in contact. They exchange pictures, videos each other and do live chat in Skype. Internet communication has a lot of advantages for business people. They do not need to fly abroad and save travel costs. 
Email is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet. Pictures, documents and other files are sent as email attachments.
