==Engine==

The 1.9 tdi AGR engine is a turbo charged high speed direct injection diesel engine 

==Fuel Delivery==

The AGR is fitted with a [[Bosch VP 37]] injection pump and [[valve covered orifice injectors]] which use a two stage injection to give a pre injection.

==ECU==

The ECU uses signals from a number of sensors to optimise the timing of fuel delivery and control a number of other engine functions

===sensors===

*[[injector lift sensor]]
*[[air inlet temperature sensor]]
*[[mass air flow sensor]]
*[[crank position sensor]]
*[[coolant temperature sensor]]
*a number of sensors fitted to the [[Bosch VP 37]] injection pump

===control===

*[[exhaust gas recirculation - EGR]]
*glow plugs
When the keys are turned on the ECU reads the coolant temperature and determines the amount of time to operate the pre glow and pre glow indication light.
Once the engine has started the glow plugs are kept on until ....
