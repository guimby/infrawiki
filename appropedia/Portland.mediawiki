Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Cycling in Portland, Oregon|Cycling in Portland, Oregon]]: Bicycle use in Portland, Oregon has been growing rapidly, having nearly tripled since 2001; for example, bicycle traffic on four of the Willamette River bridges has increased from 2,855 before 1992 to over 16,000 in 2008, partly due to improved facilities. Portland's Bureau of Transportation says 6% of commuters bike to work in Portland, the highest proportion of any major US city and about 10 times the national average.

:Due to its urban bicycling efforts, Portland has earned multiple "bicycle-friendly city" awards, including being awarded platinum status by the League of American Bicyclists, and it ranks highly among the most bicycle friendly cities in the world.

Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Portland,_Oregon#Parks_and_gardens|Portland, Parks and gardens]]: In 1995, voters in the Portland metropolitan region passed a regional bond measure to acquire valuable natural areas for fish, wildlife, and people. Ten years later, more than 8,100 acres (33 km2) of ecologically valuable natural areas had been purchased and permanently protected from development. Portland's city park system has been proclaimed one of the best in America. In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land reported that Portland had the 7th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities. The survey revealed that 80% of Portlanders live within a half-mile to a park and over 16% of Portland's city area is parkland.

=== Reduce, reuse, repair and recycle ===

Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Transportation_in_Portland,_Oregon#Other_alternatives|Portland, car sharing]]: Portlanders living downtown or in nearby neighborhoods have car sharing as an alternative, through Zipcar, which acquired Flexcar in 2007. As of 2005,[dated info] there are over 5,000 members sharing 70 vehicles which are located in neighborhoods such as the Pearl District, Old Town Chinatown, the Lloyd District, Hawthorne, and Brooklyn.

:[[wikipedia:Transportation_in_Portland,_Oregon#Walking|Portland, walking]]: According to a city video, in 1994 Portland became the first city to develop a pedestrian master plan. Blocks in the downtown area are only 200 feet (61 m) long. Many streets in the outer southwest section of the city lack sidewalks; however, this is partially made up with various off-street trails. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Portland the 12th most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the United States.
