The '''resource curse''', also known as the "Paradox of Plenty," is the often-occurring paradox that nations with an abundance of non-renewable  natural resources tend to have less successful development than other countries.

Non-renewable resource - generally [[fossil fuels]] and [[minerals]] - tend to drive a competition among elites (political elites, military, and other groups) and corporations to exploit the resource. The country's political development and its citizens tend to suffer. 

Not all such resource-rich countries suffer the resource curse. An effective way to avoid the curse is to levy higher taxes relative to other activities, and place the earnings in a form of trust that cannot be easily be accessed for short-term political purposes such as "vote buying" through excess spending. Norway is an excellent example of this and many other countries are following its lead.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/the-resource-curse/3913632 The Resource Curse] -  podcast interview, ''Late Night Live'' - ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation).</ref>
