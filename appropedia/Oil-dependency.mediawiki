Oil dependency contributes to many problems:
* [[Air pollution]]
* dependence on foreign powers which may not always be friendly
* economic dependence on stable oil prices
* [[Peak oil]] - although the actual date when oil will become prohibitively expensive is subject to strong debate, it will come eventually. 
* Loss of reserves. It makes sense to conserve petrochemicals for specific applications which are not easily replaced by alternatives, and for emergency reserves in case of global disaster (e.g. large-scale volcanic eruptions) which could affect renewable energy production for months or years.

== Alternatives ==

* [[Renewable energy]]
* [[Energy efficiency]]
* [[Simple living]]
* [[Public transport]]
* Higher [[population density]] to make distances traveled shorter, and [[public transport]] more economical.
