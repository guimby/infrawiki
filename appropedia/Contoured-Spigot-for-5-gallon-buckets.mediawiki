==Abstract==
* Spigots manufactured for self-attachment typically rely on large gaskets to maintain a seal, which works with varying success on the curved surface of a bucket. By modeling a bucket with just its top and bottom diameters and its average thickness, it's easy to design a spigot with contours that fit well. This design is expected to fit a wide range of bucket sizes effectively. The main attachment is reasonably easy to print, and typical modification requires changing only 4 parameters in two files.

== Bill of Materials==
# OpenSCAD & the files located at http://libre3d.com/category/655/Plumbing/listings/800/Parametric-Contoured-Spigot-for-5-gallon-buckets.html <ref>http://libre3d.com/category/655/Plumbing/listings/800/Parametric-Contoured-Spigot-for-5-gallon-buckets.html</ref>
# Appropriate feedstock for printer - be aware that some plastics like PLA absorb water readily
# Will likely require a gasket of some sort between outer section and bucket - 3.5cm gasket or flat rubber cut to size will probably be sufficient

== Tools needed for fabrication==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Tools necessary to make 3.5cm hole in bucket

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary==
* Need to know top and bottom outer diameters of bucket, average thickness of bucket, and desired height of spigot - scripts will do the rest, assuming no other changes to geometry
* Useful site for bucket dimensions: <nowiki>http://fivegallonideas.com/5-gallon-bucket-dimensions/</nowiki> <ref>http://fivegallonideas.com/5-gallon-bucket-dimensions/</ref>

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
* Like many interlocking parts, especially those with threads, this is sensitive to print quality - use 100% fill, a reasonable layer thickness, and printing speed
* Expect total print times for the whole assembly between 3-5 hours - obviously dependent upon print parameters
* Assembly time is negligible, expect drilling the bucket to take longer
* Be sure to orient prints for slicing in a sane manner - flat ends down, etc.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Previously mentioned sensitivity to print quality and likely need for a gasket
* Stopcock is prone to ill fit, may be replaced with screw-based design in future

== Cost savings==
* Typical mass-produced spigots for buckets retail for ~$2-5, though none seem to account for bucket contour and few are designed quite as heavy duty, and the cost of feedstock is furthermore quite low
