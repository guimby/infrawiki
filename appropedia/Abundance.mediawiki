Many ecological and social issues are framed in terms of [[resource]] [[scarcity]]. It is certain that there are only finite amounts of material resources available for human uses, however are there enough resources for everyone? Those who frame the challenges that face us with an '''abundance''' mindset tend to answer "yes". For example, [[fresh water]] makes up only a small fraction of the Earth's water, and many people have trouble obtaining enough for basic necessities. However, this is a problem caused largely by misallocation. If fresh water were directed toward productive ends ([[bathing]] water, [[irrigation]] of [[crops]]) instead of aesthetic ends ([[flush toilets]], [[lawn]] sprinklers) these problems would be greatly alleviated.

Abundance contributes to [[resilience]] and is an essential component of [[thrivability]]. Let's create an [[economy of abundance]], i.e. let's take steps towards [[post-scarcity]]. A [[gift economy]] works best in a context of abundance.
