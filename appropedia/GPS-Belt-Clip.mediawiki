==Abstract==
* As a member of Superior Search and Rescue, I find myself using a GPS frequently during training exercises or actual searches.  At times, it can be inconvenient to continuosly remove my GPS from a pocket or backpack in order to navigate.  This GPS clip is an attempt to alleviate that issue by allowing a user to mount a GPS  to a belt, backpack strap, or other webbing attachment.
