== Introduction ==
High-shear mastification is a method of mechanically recycling plastic waste from packaging film. These plastics account for roughly 35% of plastic municipal solid waste (MSW). Before high-shear mastification, there was no process that could convert this film to that similar of its original state. The recycling of this film could only be down-cycled to a product whose mechanical properties were unimportant, such as plastic lumber. Due to this advancement, a large portion of film could be recreated using recycled materials instead of virgin polymers. The use of high-shear mastification could potentially remove 35% of the plastics currently found in landfills and save roughly the same amount from initial manufacturing[1]. {{fact}}

Companies who produce these films would benefit from this technology as well. Currently, manufacturers of film products have to dispose waste from production. This leads to increased costs from disposal and in-efficient use of resources. High-shear mastification would allow for these companies to reuse their waste from fabrication without it ever having to leave the company. {{fact}}
