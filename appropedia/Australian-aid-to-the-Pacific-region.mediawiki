The [[Lowy Institute]]'s Policy Brief, [http://www.lowyinstitute.org/Publication.asp?pid=894 Beyond Good Governance: Shifting the aid paradigm for Australian aid to the Pacific Islands region] argues that [[Australia]]'s [[foreign aid]] to the [[Pacific Islands]] has been ineffective, and a more commercially-oriented approach is suggested:

<blockquote>
Australian aid has not been effective in helping the Pacific Islands region make significant progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.  The focus of aid on improving [[public sector]] capacity and [[governance]] has not stimulated sufficient private sector participation to meet the [[international development|development]] aspirations of Pacific Island populations.  In this Lowy Institute Policy Brief, The Myer Foundation Melanesia Program Director Jenny Hayward-Jones argues that Australian aid should be used to leverage growing corporate interest in reducing global [[poverty]] into investment in the Pacific - to create real income-earning opportunities for a burgeoning youth population and underscore a solid base for improved service delivery.
(Abstract, from Lowy's email notice.)
