==About Me==

[[File:It's me.JPG|thumb|right|Fig 1: This is Emily!]]

My name is Emily and I am an English major and education and Asian studies minor. Currently, I am taking the 3D printing course at Principia college where I am learning how to build a printer, design objects, and give back to the community through the open source movement. For me, this movement is inspiring because of how it promotes a sharing of knowledge. Without this movement, I wouldn't have been able to so easily build my own functioning printer! I hope to contribute to the movement in my own way as I design new and innovative pieces.
