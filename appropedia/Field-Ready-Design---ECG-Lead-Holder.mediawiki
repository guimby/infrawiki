==Abstract==
# This design was created in response to a design request submitted by Field Ready, a non-profit 501c3, that seeks to make field ready humanitarian solutions to problems across the world. The design fulfills the need for a cheap single 3D print that will function as a ECG limb lead holder. The device was designed using dimensions similar to the previous device used as requested. 
# Requested parameters for the printed part are as follows:
## 3D printable as a single item (not made up of multiple parts)
## Similar Dimensions to original part
## Quick, easy, and intuitive to use
## Contain an appropriate placed hole such that existing sensors can be attached
# Pictures of completed print is shown to the right[[Image:Fieldready_ECG.JPG|250px|right]] [[Image:Fieldready_ECG_2.JPG|250px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# Single Part file designed using FreeCad. The device was printed using Hatchbox translucent orange PLA with a 10% infill originally.

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Printing Instructions:
## Print Speed : 100 mm/S
## Fill Density : 10%
## Layer Height : .20 mm
## Support Type : Everywhere
## Platform Adhesion Type : Brim (10 lines)
# Print time estimate: 55 minutes
# There is no necessary assembly

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Curling of 3D print off of print bed - Due to the thin cross-sectional area it might be necessary to use a brim or skirt to secure the lower layers of the print to your print bed

== Cost savings==
# Estimated Cost ~ $0.35 depending on filament price
# No Commercial equivalent of dry electrodes
## Disposable ECG Electrodes sell at $7.50 for a 50 pack but are not available in many developing countries https://www.cablesandsensors.com/products/disposable-ecg-electrodes?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=googlepla&variant=3536265092&gclid=CNaN9_GNsNACFYEdgQodJjAOaw
