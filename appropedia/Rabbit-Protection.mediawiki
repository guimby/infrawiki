'''To protect Trees and Shrubs from the attack of Hares.'''

''Household Cyclopedia'', 1881

Take three pints of melted [[tallow]] to one of tar, and mix
them well together over a gentle fire. In November take
a small brush and go over the rind or bark of the trees
with the mixture, in a milk-warm state’ as thin as it can
be laid on with the brush. This coating will not hinder
the juices or sap expanding in the smallest degree. Its efficacy has been proved by applying the liquid to one tree
and missing another, when the latter has been attacked
and the former left. During five years’ experience, of
those besmeared the first two years not one was injured
afterwards. If all the bark were properly gone over with
the mixture they probably would not need any more for
some years.
