Lighting is important to [[education]]:
* It gives people more time to study, after nightfall. See [[Category:Electric lighting]] for more information on lighting, and for practical technologies to help meet this need. 
* The type of lighting is claimed in the effect that different kinds of lighting have on the learning environment. [http://www.boysforward.com/tips/tiparchive020505.htm ''Boys and Homework''], by educational consultant Ian Lillico from BoysForward.com, recommends: "Try to ensure his room has no fluorescent lights, as these are disastrous to boys' learning. An incandescent light and preferably the low voltage 12V Quartz Halogen down lights are the best for giving atmosphere."{{fact}} 
:* '''Suggested project''': examine the effects of different lights on learning, paying particular attention to the effect of choosing sustainable lighting options ([[fluorescent light]]{{w|fluorescent light}}, [[CFL]] or [[compact fluorescent light]]{{w|compact fluorescent light}} and the new white [[LED]] lights).{{sp}} Note that developing countries may have poor power supply, making CFL widespread choice - e.g. in Indonesia, [[CFL]] lights are found everywhere, and [[incandescent light bulbs]]{{w|incandescent light bulbs}} are generally unavailable.<ref>based on the experience of [[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] in Indonesia in 1995, 1996 and 1998-2000.</ref>
