==Problem being addressed==
Complications due to prolonged second stage of labor include potentially fatal maternal (hemorrhage, infection) and newborn complications (birth asphyxia and trauma), which are major sources of maternal and neonatal morbidity. In settings with limited surgical capacities and human resource constraints, a low-cost, simple and non-surgical means of assisting with labor may save the lives of many mothers and infants.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Odon Device is made of film-like polyethylene material and may be potentially safer and easier to apply than forceps and vacuum extractor (contraindicated in cases of HIV infection) for assisted deliveries, and a safe alternative to some Caesarean sections in settings with limited surgical capacity and human resource constraints. The five steps of its use can be found [http://www.odondevice.org/device.php here].

==Designed by==
*Designed by:
Mr Jorge Od√≥n. 
A detailed description can be found [http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/odon_device/en/index.html here].
*Manufacturer location:
Currently tested in Argentina.

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
The method was tested successfully in 2008 at Des Moines University and holds potential for addressing prolonged labor without advanced medical technology or expertise. Article available [http://maternova.net/health-innovations/od%C3%B3n-device-novel-%E2%80%9Cplastic-bag%E2%80%9D-paradigm-assisted-vaginal-delivery here].

There are currently clinical trials in Argentina and rural South Africa.  Phase I (Feto-maternal feasibility and security) was launched at the Saavedra branch of CEMIC, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Summaries available [http://savinglivesatbirth.net/summaries/38 here].
