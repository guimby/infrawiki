'''Caraway''' (''Carum cavi'') is a biennial herb plant that is easy to grow. It will sow itself once it is planted. It is a hardy plant and will tolerate a tough winter.<ref name="Leth" />

== Description ==
The leaves of the caraway plant are feathery or rosette-shaped and light green in colour. In the first year, the leaves will be all that the plant produces.<ref name="Leth" />

The plant has small clusters of tiny flowers in the summer. The flower colours range from white to pale pink.

== Growing caraway ==
Sow caraway seeds in the early autumn (fall) or spring.

When the seedlings have their first true leaves and appear strong, thin to about 20cm apart.

== Harvesting caraway ==
Allow the plant to flower and set seed. The seed heads are ready to remove around mid- to late-summer. To remove, cut off the seed heads, just before they ripen fully. You will be able to tell this when you see a light brown colour, the scent is evident and some have begun to fall from the flower head.<ref name="Leth" />

Dry the seeds by hanging the seed heads in a paper bag. Keep the bag in a dry and well-ventilated place, to allow the seeds to dry fully. This should only take a few days in good weather.

== Uses for caraway ==
Caraway seeds are used in a variety of culinary dishes, and they have a slight hint of aniseed. The seeds are often included in baking, such as: breads (rye or Turkish breads, for example), cakes, biscuits (cookies), buns and festive season recipes. They are also used in soups, stews, goulash, on vegetables (especially cabbage) and even in cheese. Some liqueurs are made with caraway seed as a flavouring, such as Aquavit and Kummel.

In the second year of the plant's cycle, the leaves were sometimes used in place of parsley.<ref name="Leth">Magna Leth, (1976) ''Herbs: How to grow and use them'', ISBN 0-245-52848-2</ref>
