==Introduction==
Neodymium magnets (Ndfeb) are composed of neodymium, iron, boron and a few transition metals. These magnets are extremely strong for their small size, metallic in appearance and found in simple shapes such as rings, blocks and discs. Their max energy product can be 35MGOe~50MGOe , Neodymium magnets are developed rapidly and applied widely due to their perfect characteristic, rich raw material resource and reasonable price.

Applications of Sintered Neodymium Magnets:

* Magnetic separators 
* Microphone assemblies 
* Servo motors
* DC motors (automotive starters) and other motors 
* Computer rigid disc drives
* magnetic resonance imaging
* Various holders
* Toys
* Meters
* Odometer
* sensors

Attributes of Neodymium Material:

Very high resistance to demagnetization 
High energy for size 
Good in ambient temperature 
Moderately priced 
Material is corrosive and should be coated for long term maximum energy output 
Low working temperature for heat applications, but higher levels of heat resistance materials are being introduced periodically
