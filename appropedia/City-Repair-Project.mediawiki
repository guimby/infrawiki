== City Repair Project ==
City Repair Project (CRP) is a non-profit organization [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29 501(c)3] that began in 2001 in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon Portland, OR]. To CRP, “localization of culture, economy, and decision-making” is crucial feature of sustainable communities. CRP encourages and empowers individuals of communities to reclaim public space through artistic and ecologically-responsible projects that tear down the barriers between humans and the natural environment [http://cityrepair.org/]. By empowering people to transform their public spaces, CRP and the people they work with have challenged norms and created active and engaged communities. 

== The Grid System ==
	CRP makes efforts to reestablish the ''civil'' aspect of civilization, especially in regards to the modern urban grid standard. Although not the first to utilize the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan grid system], [http://www.spur.org/events/calendar/ancient-roman-city-planning the Romans largely introduced the urban grid] as an effective city planning system [http://theworldisurban.com/2011/06/history-of-the-grid/].

	In the grid system, travelers could meet with other travelers at regular intervals, where the streets intersected. But as people began to drive cars more often, intimate interactions began to dwindle. Intersections have become places where traffic and tensions builds up, people don’t signal, and violence has increased.
	CRP believes that the grid system has lead to people feeling isolated from their communities, and has thereby made it difficult for community space to flourish. Whereas cities and towns without a grid system have naturally occurring space for gatherings, with the grid system, meeting places need to be deliberately planned [http://cityrepair.org/about/why-city-repair/].

== Placemaking ==	
	Architects and city planners have been conceptualizing human reclamation of streets [[File:PlaceDiagram.jpg|thumb|left|placemaking diagram]]  since the 1960s. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs Jane Jacobs] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Whyte William H. Whyte] were among the first pioneers of city planing that was centered on people’s needs and aspirations, not cars and supermarkets. This idea is called [http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/ Placemaking], and its visionaries believe that “when you focus on place, you do everything differently” [http://www.pps.org/reference/what_is_placemaking/]. 
By opening neighborhood planning to local residents, the focus shifts from managing people as they shuffle between A and B, to empowering residents to shape their own community experience.


== Projects == 
[[File:Vbc2013.jpg|thumb|right|VBC event schedule]]
CRP works on many projects around Portland, including the annual [http://vbc.cityrepair.org/index.php?id=59 Village Building Convergence], a “placemaking festival” that blends activism, hands-on education, community development, and art to create partnerships between governments, residents, and communities [http://vbc.cityrepair.org/]. The Village Building Convergence lasts ten days and the event in 2013 will begin May 24th [http://vbc.cityrepair.org/index.php?id=197] 

CRP is also involved in various [http://www.streetfilms.org/intersection-repair/ intersection repair], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_building natural building], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placemaking placemaking] projects around Portland [http://cityrepair.org/].

== Sunnyside Piazza ==
[[File:SunnysidePiazza.jpg|thumb|left|Sunnyside Piazza abuzz]]
[http://www.sunnysidepiazza.blogspot.com/ The Sunnyside Piazza] is perhaps one of CRP’s most famous intersection repair projects. This inner-city intersection in Portland, OR. was transformed into a community space in 2001, in efforts to reduce neighborhood crime and increase individual sense of place [http://www.pps.org/great_public_spaces/one?public_place_id=504]. The project seems to have had a positive effect; a study by [https://search.knodeinc.com/viewProfile.action;jsessionid=1cor3vxsztxt21xfcubwdubdz5?profile.profileId=A2751788#.UorziWTcpKk Jan C. Semenza] showed that people in the Sunnyside neighborhood were 30% happier with their neighborhood than people in a nearby neighborhood with a similar demographic [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447989/]. 

== Placemaking in Arcata ==
[http://www.arcataplayhouse.org/creamery.html The Creamery District] in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcata,_California Arcata, CA] is also jumping on the placemaking bandwagon. In May 2013, Playhouse Arts granted five local artists a total of over $7,000 to work on art projects in communal spaces in the Creamery District.

The projects were completed in August of the same year, and are viewable by taking a walk around [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=9th+and+L+arcata&ie=UTF-8&ei=APyMUqrlJYmEiwLAj4DAAg&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg 8th and 9th streets on the east side of K Street].
