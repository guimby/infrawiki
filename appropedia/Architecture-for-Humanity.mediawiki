[http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/ Architecture for Humanity] is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization founded in 1999 to promote architectural and design solutions to global, social and humanitarian crises. Through competitions, workshops, educational forums, partnerships with aid organizations and other activities, Architecture for Humanity creates opportunities for architects and designers from around the world to help communities in need. AfH believes that where resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable and collaborative design can make a difference.

Though the title of the organization suggests it is more about design than technology, in fact the group strongly advocates [[appropriate technology]] and [[sustainability]] as a part of design.  In this respect, they are very well aligned with Appropedia (or vice versa, depending on your perspective).

Architecture for Humanity unveiled the [http://www.openarchitecturenetwork.org Open Architecture Network] on March 8, 2007, and soon thereafter partnered with Appropedia to help build sustainable, open source solutions with the world.  The Open Architecture Network is a media-rich library of creative commons-licensed architectural designs.
