=== Community energy ===

About 85 percent of total primary energy supply in Iceland is derived from domestically produced [[renewable energy]] sources.

In 2011, geothermal energy provided about 65 percent of primary energy, the share of hydropower was 20 percent, and the share of fossil fuels (mainly oil products for the transport sector) was 15 percent. In 2013, Iceland also became a producer of wind energy.

The main use of geothermal energy is for space heating with the heat being distributed to buildings through extensive district-heating systems. About 85% of all houses in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy.

Renewable energy provides almost 100 percent of electricity production, with about 75 percent coming from hydropower and 25 percent from geothermal power. 

Iceland is the world’s largest green energy producer per capita and largest electricity producer per capita. <ref>[[wikipedia:Renewable energy in Iceland]]</ref>

Iceland expects to be energy-independent by 2050. 

As of 2012, the government of Iceland is in talks with the government of [[United Kingdom]] about the possibility of constructing a high-voltage direct-current connector for transmission of electricity between the two countries. Such a cable would give Iceland access to a market where electricity prices have generally been much higher than those in Iceland. Iceland has considerable renewable energy resources, especially geothermal energy and hydropower resources, and most of the potential has not been developed, partly because there is not demand for additional electricity generation capacity from the residents and industry of Iceland, but the United Kingdom is interested in importing inexpensive electricity from renewable sources of energy, and this could lead to further development of the energy resources. <ref>[[wikipedia:Iceland#Energy]]</ref>
