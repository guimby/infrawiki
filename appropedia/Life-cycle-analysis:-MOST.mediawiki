The following steps are required before a [[Life Cycle Analysis]] (LCA) can be conducted.
*Define your scope
**Determine how much of the life cycle you are going to cover in your analysis
**Usually this is from cradle (extraction) to grave (how it is landfilled/recycled/etc)
*Gather information on materials & how they are processed
**From a previous LCA
**From the manufacturer
**From the literature
**From common knowledge
*Choose an appropriate functional unit
**Based on lifetime/output/etc
*Download/install [[life cycle analysis tools]]
**Make sure you have a good selection of databases to choose your materials from
***Verify that these databases are reliable sources of information, either by consulting a professional, looking online, manufacturing details, or common knowledge.
