There are over 150 great tech brief documents that may be ported, in several categories from [http://practicalaction.org/?id=technical_briefs Practical Action's site]. 
*See also: [[Help:Porting content from PDF format]] for some suggestions about techniques (and if you have additional techniques, by all means please share those on the help page).

== A suggested process ==
The following process is suggested to help coordinate multiple people doing the porting:
#Identify a page that has not yet been tagged by someone for porting
#Before you get too far, check that, indeed, the page has not yet been ported
#Tag the page, with your user signature (we request that all porters create logins and simple user pages) and timestamp (you can use the 4 ~'s; clicking the second-from-right button in the editing toolbar will insert that for you).  See examples below.
#Create the target page using the name of the Technical Brief, plus "PATB" (Practical Action Technical Brief) to make the name distinct
#Copy / paste the following at the top of your new article: <tt><nowiki>{{PATBpage}}</nowiki></tt>
#As you work through the page, please check to see if there is any indication of content that is not sourced by Practical Action.  
##If so, make note in the status that addition permission is required.  
##Go ahead and request the permission if you're comfortable with that (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]), noting in the status that you have done so.
##Otherwise just note that permission is needed.  
##Of course, if we cannot get permission for some content, we need to make note of that and remove the document from the list of content to be ported
#As you make progress, update the status bullet (below) for the page, update your signature and timestamp so that we can tell if a page gets stuck for some reason.
#If you're clear about how to categorize the page, please go ahead and do that when the page is largely complete (i.e. worth reading)
#If you're not comfortable doing the categorization, please note that in the page status when you are done with your work
Thanks for your help!
