<center>''A wheel showing the various methods of transportation to the dunes and the carbon footprint of each.''</center>

== Abstract ==
The purpose of this page is to show off the Alternative Transportation Wheel that our ERE215 group built for Friends of the Dunes.

== Background ==
Our main goal of the transportation wheel is to get visitors of FOTD to think about the mode of transportation they used to arrive there and the corresponding carbon footprint that they have just produced. 

== Problem Statement and Criteria ==
=== Problem Statement ===
The objective is to create an interactive exhibit that will get visitors to think about their means of travel and the impact they are having on the environment.
