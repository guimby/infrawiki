* [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8542 Thingiverse]
:A prototype created by Nicholas C Lewis

* [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1908026860/inkshield-an-open-source-inkjet-shield-for-arduino Inkjet shield for Arduino]
:This shield allows you to connect a HP C6602 inkjet cartridge to your [[Arduino]] turning it into a 96dpi print platform

==Advantages==
There are a lot of interesting possibilities for the use of such DIY open source inkjet printers to create [[appropriate technologies]] for [[sustainable development]]. 

* avoiding unnecessary plastic parts in most commercial printers
* avoiding shipping carbon-fingerprint cost
* fully customization and artistic projects 
* when your printer will break down, you won't buy a new one like nowadays with commercial printers, you'll just replace or fix the part that is malfunctionining in your open source.
* no more [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VLQmN01-5Y planned-obsolence] chips or drivers added by the manufacturer to force keep replacing their expensive ink cartridge.

== Potential Applications==
# Replacing commercial inkjet printers
# [http://egg-bot.com/ Egg-bot] or circular printers like this [http://blog.makezine.com/2008/02/06/ping-pong-ball-printer/ pingpong printer]
