Aspects of '''sustainability in the office''':

Physical environment:
* Building design - [[passive solar]], [[natural lighting]]
* Choose a moderate temperature - [[air conditioner]] no lower than 26 deg C, or if [[heating]], the [[thermostat]] should be no higher that (20 deg C?), or lower if people are accustomed to lower temperatures.
* Energy: 
** Use energy efficient lighting. 
* Choose a location where employees and visitors can arrive by [[public transport]], [[cycling]] and/or [[walking]].

Practices:
* Paper
** Operate electronically as far as possible, to minimize usage. This requires a very careful process of backing up electronically.
* Turn lights off when not required. 
* Energy - choose a [[green energy]] option where possible. This generally requires a paying a little extra - do your calculations. 
* Waste management - separate your waste streams, and ensure each is processed sustainably. 
** In a small office, there may be someone in the office who lives nearby and has a [[compost bin]] or [[worm bin]], who is happy to have some extra input from food scraps and other suitable waste. 
* Encourage use of [[public transport]], [[cycling]] and/or [[walking]] to work:
** Find out what would make this easier for employees, e.g. flexible start and finish times, and a change room for cyclists
