Bart Orlando built his first [[pedal powered]] electric generator in 1989 while traveling through New Mexico with the [http://www.mediaversal.com/wesley/walk/walk1.html Global Walk For A Livable World]. ([http://www.humboldt.edu/%7Eccat/pedalpower/inventions/images/globalwalk.jpg PHOTO of the Global Walk] arriving in New Mexico). It consisted of an exercise bike and a belt driven car alternator. While at the Santa Fe Renewable Energy Fair, Bart met [http://www.dankoffsolar.com/ Windy Dankoff] who donated a permanent magnet dc generator and explained how it was more suited for pedal power application because it had a much lower rpm rating then the alternator. Windy further explained that alternators were less efficient than permanent magnet generators because a significant portion of the electricity generated by the alternator was used to power an [http://science.howstuffworks.com/electromagnet.htm electromagnetic] coil within the alternator. The bike was used to power the PA system for the anti-Persian Gulf War protests on the Arcata plaza in 1991. The pedal powered generator is shown on the right side of the above photo suppling [[electricity]] to a PA system used for a HEMP RALLY featuring [http://www.jackherer.com/ Jack Herer] on the Quad at HSU in 1990.
