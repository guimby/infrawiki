To date, they have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions, with more on the way. They currently also have a over 1,000,000 free ebook titles available.

Open Library is an open project: the software is [[open source]], the data are open, the documentation is open, and they welcome your contribution.
