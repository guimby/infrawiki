Download the OpenSCAD library from https://github.com/phidiasllc/tool_effector. Please read the instructions on that page!

There is also a folder containing stl models of common tools at that location.

= Note =

The microscope holder requires the large tool effector. The stl files available are not intended to fit all microscopes. The SCAD script should be modified to produce a holder that fits our scope.

= Assembly =

# [[File:Athena_microscope_dressing.JPG|thumb|right|Dress the print.]] Clean up the print and scrape out the bearing pockets with the small screwdriver.{{clear}}
# Remove all grease and corrosion inhibitor from the ball bearings. Use acetone if necessary.
# [[File:Athena_microscope_bearings.JPG|thumb|right|Put bearings on magnets.]] Put the ball bearings on the three inner magnets on the top of the large tool effector.{{clear}}
# [[File:Athena_microscope_tool_epoxy.JPG|thumb|right|Epoxy bearing pockets.]] Mix a small amount of epoxy and smear some around the interiors of the bearing pockets. Align the fiduciary marks on the sprung tool mount and small tool effector and squeeze the sprung tool mount onto the ball bearings. Set aside to let epoxy cure. NOTE: If too much epoxy is applied to the bearing pockets, it can run down and epoxy the tool mount permanently to the tool effector.{{clear}}
# Ideally, the microscope is a friction fit in the holder, as shown below. If not, nut and screw pockets are part of the model, allowing one to use screws to hold the microscope in place (nuts are optional).
