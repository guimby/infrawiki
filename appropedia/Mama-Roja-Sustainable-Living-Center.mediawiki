At Mama Roja they provide internships to students to teach them about ways to promote eco-friendly living and sustainable technologies. These internships at minimum last a month but priority is given to students who stay the whole term. This hands-on experience provides that the internships will focus on the various aspects of sustainable living: organic gardening, appropriate technologies, natural food production, earthen and natural building.

== How is Mama Roja Sustainable? ==
Without disturbing the peace of their neighbor bug friends and other animals that may roam to their area, Mama Roja strives to be sustainable. When it comes to building they build by hand and feet, using leftover resources like fallen trees in the forest for wood, on site found mud and other resources rescued for use. When it comes to gardening they amend the soil, plant, transplant, preserve seeds and use natural pesticides. They have a bike powered washing machine on-site for clothes and teach the ways of alternative refrigeration, reforestation, chicken care, and herbal medicine making[http://mamaroja.blogspot.com/search/label/natural%20living]. Beeswax candles and fresh mulberries found and turned into pie can make for a great evening at Mama Roja. Working with the earth and not against it, Mama Roja has built a community for people afar or near to enjoy and invest in as well.
