'''Carrying capacity''' is an ecologist's term that defines the population of any given species able to be supported indefinitely in a defined habitat in a way that won't harm or destroy the ecosystem on which it depends in any permanent way. Once the population is over this capacity, the ecosystem may suffer from irreparable harm or damage.
