'''Energy policy''' in general is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[energy distribution]] and [[energy consumption]]. The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], [[international treaties]], [[incentives to investment]], guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[taxation]] and other public policy techniques. 

Here energy policy is developed to reduce [[green house gas]] emissions and [[fossil fuel]] combustion, while increasing the percentage of [[renewable energy]] such as [[wind]], [[solar]], [[solar photovoltaic]], [[hydroelectric]], [[geothermal]], etc. This is done both by encouraging [[energy efficiency]] while also trying to bolster [[alternative energy]] sources. Even modest changes to energy policy can have an enormous effect on both the type of [[energy]], but also its use.
