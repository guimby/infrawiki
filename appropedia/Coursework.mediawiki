'''Coursework''' refers to work carried out by students at [[university]] or [[high school]] as part of their learning and assessment, separate from their exams.

==Description of this area==

This area categorizes course related content, and provides links to other valuable sources (see "External links," below).  Please see the syllabi, presentations, readings, exercises, problem sets, teaching cases, etc. in the pages and subcategories below.

==Are you a teacher?==

* Post your [[course materials]], including schedule or lecture notes.
* Consider making Appropedia a part of your curriculum.  Students can post and edit their [[coursework]] on subjects related to [[sustainability]] and [[international development]]. This allows them to take part in a global context, receive broader feedback, learn to [[Help:Contents|edit]] a wiki (very simple, but useful) and more easily collaborate with peers.
