= Introduction =
The [[Potawot| Potawot Health Village]] is a branch of the [http://uihs.org/index.php United Indian Health Services] whose services combine Western medicine and traditional Native American methods of promoting wellness.<ref name="UIHS1">"UIHS Traditional Health Statement." United Indian Health Services. 27 October 2008. http://uihs.org/traditional.html</ref> The designers who worked on designing the grounds knew that nature has sacred value within the Native American community.  The set up of this design can be seen in Figure 1. They sought to create a space which honored tradition and would help their community to stay healthy, both physically and emotionally.<ref name="Eric">Johnson, Eric. Personal Interview. 28 October 2008</ref>  One aspect of this idea was recreating the original habitats and biomes that once dominated the area, before people of European descent settled on the land.<ref name="Eric"/>

= History of the Area =
The Northern California coast, including the area around Humboldt Bay, has been the home of the [http://www.wiyot.com/ Wiyot] people for thousands of years.<ref name="Wiyot">"History and Culture." Wiyot Tribe. 29 May 2004. 27 October 2008. http://www.wiyot.com/history.htm</ref><ref name="Arcata">"Our History." ''About Arcata''. City of Arcata. 09 August 2008. 27 October 2008. http://www.arcatacityhall.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=90</ref> Other tribes native to the area are the [http://www.yuroktribe.org/ Yurok], [http://www.tolowa-nsn.gov/ Tolowa], and [http://karuk.us/ Karuk].  The land around them, traditionally a place of forests, seasonal wetlands, and heavy salmon runs, profoundly influenced their lives.<ref name="Wiyot"/><ref name="Arcata"/>

However, as people of European descent moved into the region, the Wiyot were pushed off their native lands, which were reshaped to be more suitable for “modern” farming and development methods.<ref name="Arcata"/>  On the [[Potawot]] land specifically, forests were cut down, native grasses were replaced by faster growing ones, and the seasonal wetlands were destroyed to make the land more conducive towards farming and grazing.<ref name="Eric"/>

In 1996, the [http://uihs.org/index.php United Indian Health Services] began working with the [http://www.arcatacityhall.org/index.php City of Arcata] and the [http://www.arcatacityhall.org/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=127&Itemid=187 Planning Commission] to get their newly purchased land, which was zoned as “Agricultural Exclusive” to be approved for a Planned Development Permit and a General Plan & Zoning Map Amendment.  A year later,  their plans for the Health Village at [[Potawot]] were finally approved.<ref name="UIHS2">"About UIHS." United Indian Health Services. 2003. 27 October 2008. http://uihs.org/about.html</ref>

As the owners of Potawot researched the land, they found that within the vicinity of the site were four historical Wiyot village locations as well as a burial ground for the victims of the [http://www.wiyot.com/history.htm 1860 Indian Island Massacre].<ref name="UIHS2"/>  However, the land has been changed so much over the years that it is now impossible to find the original locations.<ref name="UIHS2"/>  They also found the fossilized remains of spruce cones and other plants which helped determine what species were native to the immediate area.<ref name="Eric"/>

= Forest Restoration Efforts =
[[Image:potawot_restorationareasign.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 2: Sign introducing the Potawot Restoration Area (Photo: Ryndie Azevedo)]]The [[Potawot]] grounds are known as the Ku’wah-dah-wilth Restoration Area (Fig. 2), which means “comes back to life” in the Wiyot language.<ref name="UIHS3">"Ku' wah-dah-wilth Restoration Area" United Indian Health Services. 2003. 27 October 2008. http://uihs.org/kuwahdahwilth.html</ref>  It is meant to reinforce the idea of the lands revitalization and the renewal of the natural resources that once existed there.  Work on the site has included planting native species of trees and shrubs, restoring the grasses and wetland areas, and creating a comfortable space for the clients of the [http://uihs.org/index.php United Indian Health Services].  This space is also considered to aid in the healing of mind, body, and spirit.<ref name="UIHS3"/>

== Support for the Project ==
According to those who work for the [[Potawot | Potawot Health Village]], the community's reaction to the forest restoration efforts has been positive.<ref name="Eric"/>  Financing was found in grants from the [http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/ Natural Resources Conservation Service], a branch of the [http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usdahome United States Department of Agriculture], as well as through a [http://www.carcd.org/ California Resource Conservation District].  These grants helped to offset the initial cost of the project.<ref name="Eric"/>

Local tribes, notably the [http://www.yuroktribe.org/ Yurok], as well as crews of community members have also helped by collecting trees from their personal properties that would otherwise have been removed  and destroyed and replanting them at [[Potawot]].  [http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sixrivers/ Six Rivers National Forest] also donates plants that are in the path of new development or road decommissioning.  [[Potawot]] is given permission to collect and replant the trees that would have been destroyed otherwise.  Community volunteers as well as [http://www.americorps.org/ AmeriCorps] members also assisted in planting new trees.<ref name="Eric"/>

== Soil Regeneration ==
The original soil, already heavy in clay (which prevents proper drainage) had been badly damaged by years of grazing induced [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture monoculture].  Native plants brought in by community members helped to reintroduce [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endomycorrhizae endomycorrhizae], fungi which encourage root development, as well as other native microorganisms which enrich the soil.<ref name="Eric"/>  Store bought packets of endomycorrhizae helped supplement the ones carried in by native plants.  They also added redwood conditioner which makes for a loamier soil, marked by higher concentrations of silt and sand and fairly little clay, and better drainage.  In addition, fertilizer and mulch gave the trees an extra boost after first planting.<ref name="Eric"/>

== Planting Methods ==
All of the trees and shrubs on the [[Potawot]] property were gathered from community donors, local nurseries, [http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sixrivers/ Six Rivers National Forest], and through [[Potawot | Potawot’s]] own propagation in their native species nursery.<ref name="Eric"/>

The trees and shrubs were planted in clusters around the property and in combinations in which they are thought to grow in nature (Fig. 3). The clusters make them easier for the maintenance staff to care for and are separated by meadows (Fig. 3).  Trees were also specifically planted around the edges of the [[Potawot]] property.<ref name="Eric"/>  On the south side, redwoods were planted to block noise pollution from the nearby freeway (Fig. 4).  Although it is unlikely that they are native to the Potawot/Arcata Bottoms area they are considered culturally significant to the local tribes and so were included within the design.  On the north side, more wind tolerant species of trees were planted, including spruce and shore pine, to help block the North winds and protect the garden.  Near the storm water treatment ponds, designers did not plant trees in an effort to discourage birds of prey from inhabiting the wetland areas, therefore ensuring the presence of wetland birds (Fig. 5).<ref name="Eric"/>

== Challenges ==
Although the people at [[Potawot]] have gathered the support of the community, there have been some problems with the topography of the area and the species which had been introduced.  At the beginning, the entire property had to be reshaped to account for the seasonal wetlands and the habitats that originally existed there.<ref name="Eric"/>  Also, the damage inflicted on the soil after about a hundred years of near monoculture was severe.  The ground had become choked with clay, had lost many of the naturally occurring microorganisms and fungi, and the pH balance was not conducive for native species.  Plant species present when [[Potawot]] first began restoration also posed a problem.  The introduced weeds and grasses were so aggressive that they would choke out the young trees, which had to compete for water and sun.<ref name="Eric"/>

The [[Potawot]] restoration efforts, as part of their attempt to create a natural space, do not perform any supplemental watering and have no irrigation system.  Due to this, some trees and shrubs have died in the past because of too little water.  However, planting in fall during the rainier time of the year helps support young trees.<ref name="Eric"/>

== Successes ==

Since restoration efforts began, around 10 acres of forested area have been restored and there have been changes in the lands around [[Potawot]].  Noise pollution is already beginning to diminish and the increased number of trees and shrubs has brought new birds, mammals, and other creatures to the area.<ref name="Eric"/> Some of these changes can be seen in Figures 6 through 8.

The increased number of animals has lead to the propagation of native species whose seed has been brought in by the animal’s droppings.  An increased number of trees and shrubs has lead to an increased amount of leaf litter and organic material in the ground which has been changing and improving the qualities of the soil.<ref name="Eric"/> 

As the trees grow larger they have begun to shade out certain grasses, most notably the invasive grasses that workers at [[Potawot]] are trying to eradicate.  In addition, the trees shade is making way for understory plants, such as ferns, to grow.<ref name="Eric"/>

= Continued Work =
Currently the forest restoration efforts at [[Potawot]] are minimal as the workers let the trees mature and grow into their surroundings and provide the areas for more shade loving undergrowth.<ref name="Eric"/>

There is some continued maintenance, such as the replacing of dead trees, but for the most part they are left alone.  Grounds workers and volunteers are also beginning to plant more trees along the North end of the site in order to provide more wind and noise protection.<ref name="Eric"/>

In addition, [[Potawot]] has been making outreach efforts regarding [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/pest_al/sodeast/sodeast.htm Sudden Oak Death].  Although, [[Potawot]] and Humboldt County have been spared this danger so far, they have been working to educate others and prevent the spread of the disease into their local areas.<ref name="Eric"/>
