Borax has antiseptic, antifungal, antibiotic, disinfectant and deodorising properties. In its powdered form, it dissolves easily in water.

Borax is poisonous if ingested. Hence, it must be kept out of reach of children and animals and it must be used with care.

Borax is usually found in the laundry section of supermarkets and some pharmacies. 

There may be restricted access to borax in some places -- it is considered a possible reproductive risk.<ref name="WP" /> As such, persons who are pregnant, nursing or raising children should not handle or use borax. Since borax can be consumed naturally, some authorities are concerned about multiple exposure and accumulation of effects.<ref name="WP" /> As such, household use of borax should be done with great care and plenty of research as the research continues to be translated into impacts and consequences of individual uses.
