===Design===
This passive solar greenhouse design is made out of mostly recycled materials. The frame is made out of 2 x 4's and plywood recycled from a construction site. The North, East, and West facing walls are lined with R 19 insulation boards. The inside walls are enforced with plywood then lined with reflective plastic. The back of the greeenhouse is lined with 21 6 gallon water jugs painted black. The South facing wall has 8 mm polycarbonate panels sealed together with silicone. The aquaponic system is made using two hydroponic trays that are filled with hydroton medium. Romaine lettuce is growing in the hydroton. There are 40 goldfish in a 18 gallon plastic rubbermaid. There is a water pump in the rubbermaid that pumps water for 5 minutes 3 times a day into the lettuce trays. The goldfish eat gold fish pellets. There is a recycled rubbermaid bed filled with reused organic soil. There is organic kale, swiss chard, broccoli, cabbage, chives, and cilantro in the bed. On top of the plastic containers in the back there are organic strawberries, thyme, mint, and basil. [[ Image:Aquaponics.jpg ]]

===Process: Passive Solar Design===
During the day the sun comes into the greenhouse through the south facing polycarbonate panels. The sun warms up the 1 and 6 gallon black water jugs. These jugs release their heat back into the greenhouse during the night when they are cooling off. The sun also heats up the soil which will release its heat back into the greenhouse at night. Outside Temperature: Day 45 Night 22. Greenhouse Temperature: Day 55 Night 32. [[ Image: Back wall good.jpg ]]
