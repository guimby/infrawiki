'''The Rain Tree Foundation''' is a grassroots social non-government organization registered under the Ministry of Interior mainly operating in Thailand among rural and underdeveloped communities. The aim is to help people through '''''education''''', '''''appropriate technology''''' and '''''self help projects''''' to improve their living standards.   

Present projects are Children Homes, Day-Care Centers, manufacturing bamboo and herbal products, informal vocational training, providing villages with clean drinking [[water filters]] and supplying water through various pump systems.

Rain Tree is continuously looking for new opportunities and ideas as to how to better help rural people. The staff at the foundation are from various local ethnic tribal groups in Thailand.


'''It's a fusion''' of http://www.thaicare.org which is responsible for the educational, social and community developing parts and http://www.meribah-ram-pump.com which provides the technical assistance like [[appropriate technologies]].
