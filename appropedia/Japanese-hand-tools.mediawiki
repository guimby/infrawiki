Traditional Japanese hand tools accomplish work by relying more on angle of attack and blade sharpness rather than force and weight. A high carbon steel is commonly used that can be honed to a very sharp edge, the head is typically set at a very ergonomic angle, with the whole assembly being lightweight to reduce fatigue.

* [[Sickle]] (''Kama'') - While requiring a stooped or kneeling posture, the light weight and extremely sharp blade make this tool my favorite for selective cutting where a scythe won't fit. It cuts well with a flicking motion, with the blade hitting the target in a slicing motion. They are available in different weights and sizes.

* [[Hoe]] (''Kuwa'') - The long lightweight handle and the sharp blade angle makes for an easily adjusted cutting angle from scalping to deep cutting. Combined with a sharp English garden spade to cut the edge followed by this hoe makes very light work of cutting edges for new sheet mulch beds where a formal edge is desired. It is also great for rough working sod in preparation for [[overseeding]].

* [[Brushhook]] (''Yabukarigama'') - This is a great tool for [[clearing blackberry]] (''Rubus discolor''). It can be used in a chopping motion, or held level and used to cut canes off at the knees, while a partner rolls back the canes. You can work a whole hillside of blackberry in the time it takes another to nibble at a corner with pruning tools.
