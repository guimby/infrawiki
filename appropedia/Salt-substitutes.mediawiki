These are various other kinds of metal salts such as potassium chloride used to substitute for the ordinary sodium chloride [[salt]] we are familiar with. They have their uses, but should not be used in foods undergoing a heated preservation processing, they can cause the product to taste bad. Even the heat from normal cooking is sometimes sufficient to cause this. 

It has been suggested that societies or individuals with very high salt intakes may benefit from a salt substitute containing a mixture of salts, including potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate as well as normal salt (sodium chloride), rather than just sodium chloride. A trial has been conducted in a region of China (Yunnan?) where salt use is traditionally very high, with promising results in terms of the subjects' health.<ref>''I think this was on the Health Report, by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, some time in 2006. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]], 04:13, 20 February 2007 (PST)''</ref>{{fact}}
