== Day One ==

The most essential things are protection from exposure and sustenance, in the form of easily digestible caloric intake. 

Timing is critical - on the first day it is probably impossible to provide instant adequate housing for everyone. So what can be provided to maximize chances of survival?

=== Airdrop hats and chocolate ===

Easily transportable items that can help survival are:
* '''Hats and socks''' - warm "beanie" style hats greatly reduce heatloss. Warm socks are valuable, though less critical as most people will already have socks.
* '''Chocolate''' - energy dense food keeps people warm. Chocolate is easily digested, needs no preparation, and due to its fat content is more energy dense than pure sugar.{{fact}}
