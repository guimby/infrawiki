The '''Powered Easel''' is designed to be used by individuals who have minimal mobility of their upper extremities.

The drawing surface is moved with the use of a joystick. The joystick controls two small DC motors that in turn drive a set of power screws. Although the design was undertaken specifically for one quadriplegic, complete drawings have been released for interested groups or individuals.

This design produces a cost effective solution to what would otherwise be a completely custom designed and fabricated unit. This alternative is obtainable because it utilizes some flexibility in manufacturing, simple machining, and is made of readily available parts.

This project would be an ideal high school shop project, providing students the opportunity to contribute their talents to the community.<ref>[http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/Us_Eu/conf/resna96/page8.html THE POWERED EASEL] -  RESNA '96 Proceedings.</ref>
