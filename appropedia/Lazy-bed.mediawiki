'''Lazy bed''' is a method of cultivation. Rather like [[cord rig cultivation]], parallel banks of ridge and furrow are dug by [[spade]] although lazy beds have banks that are bigger, up to 2.5m in width, with narrow drainage channels between them.

Although it is nearly extinct, it is still practiced in parts of the [[Hebrides]] where lazybeds are known as ''feannagan'' in Scottish Gaelic, and the west of [[Ireland]]. In these places, the method used is normally to lift up sods of [[peat]] and to used [[seaweed]] [[fertiliser]] (desalinated) to improve the ground. [[Potato]]es were often grown in this way in these regions, until the potato blight ''Phytophthora infestans'', caused the potato famine in the [[Highlands]] and Ireland. It was used in southern parts of [[Britain]] from the post-Roman period until the post-medieval period, and across much of Ireland and Scotland until the 19th century.
