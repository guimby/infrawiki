'''Abstract:''' This paper addresses the issue of why concentrator systems have not gained a significant market share. The history of concentrator development is reviewed, and the status of existing concentrator efforts outlined. A critical look at the requirements to propel concentrators to a prominent market role in large-scale power production is presented. Various concentrator and ¯at-plate PV system approaches are compared by computing the expected cost of energy, and conclusions are drawn as to what the best course of action will be. Concentrator systems are projected to be the lowest-cost, lowest-risk PV option for medium and large PV power plants.

'''Abstract'''--A new principle for collecting and concentrating solar energy, the ideal cylindrical light collector, has been invented. This development has its origins in detecting Cherenkov radiation in high energy physics experiments. In its present form, the collector is a trough-like reflecting wall light channel of a specific shape which concentrates radiant energy by the maximum amount allowed by phase space conservation. The ideal cylindrical light collector is capable of accepting solar radiation over an average ~8-hr day and concentrating it by a factor of -10 without diurnal tracking of the sun. This is not possible by conventional imaging techniques. The ideal collector is non-imaging and possesses an effective relative aperture (f-number)= 0.5. This collector has a larger acceptance for diffuse light than concentrating collectors using imaging optics. In fact, the etficiency for collecting and concentrating isotropic radiation, in comparison with a fiat plate collector, is just the reciprocal of the concentration factor.

Fraidenraich, “Design procedure of V-trough cavities for photovoltaic systems,” Progress in photovoltaics: Research and applications,  vol. 6, 1998, pp. 43–54.]=====

'''Abstract:''' The combination of photovoltaic (PV) systems with V-trough cavities has been identified as an attractive option to reduce, in the short time scale, the prices of the PV electrical energy. In places of good radiation level, the output energy of these devices can be almost doubled, compared to PV ¯at-plate fixed systems. Additionally, V-trough cavities are simple to manufacture and can be used with conventional (1-sun) solar cells. In this work we present a design procedure for V-trough cavities used in combination with PV generators. The main design requirements are: uniform illumination on the plane of the PV module, within a finite interval of incidence angles; minimum cost of energy; and heat dissipation by natural, passive means. The V-trough cavities depend on two parameters. We obtain a first analytical relation between the concentration ratio (C) and the V-trough angle (c) for concentrators with uniform illumination at the absorber. The region of minimum cost of the V-trough PV ensemble yields a second relation. Then, a unique pair of cavity parameters, satisfying the above criteria, is found. A design example of a V-trough cavity for the city of Recife, PE, Brazil, is presented.

'''ABSTRACT:''' A new photovoltaic concentrator system with passive tracking has been developed and tested (EU Joule III Project ARCHIMEDES). It is based upon irradiation enhancement in the module plane by flat plate mirrors in Vtrough configuration and elimination of losses from off axis incidence using a maintenance free solar tracking unit, the thermohydraulic actuator (THA). The new ARCHIMEDES system is designed for highly efficient and long term reliable water pumping and can offer up to more than 40% cost advantages compared to conventional fixed flat plate systems. Prototypes are installed since summer 2000 in Germany, Spain and on Crete. The field test results confirm the concept.

'''ABSTRACT:''' DoubleSun® technology is a V-trough concentration system that makes use of commercial photovoltaic monocrystalline silicon modules. The system integrates a 2-axes tracking system and increases the amount of radiation falling upon the modules by using two flat mirrors. The purpose of the present work is to demonstrate the power and energy increase of commercial modules when integrated in a V-trough system as to a fixed flat-plate system. A theoretical model was developed to estimate such improvement. This model was validated by on-field data, which was acquired during an experimental campaign performed from June to August and also during November of 2008 in WS Energia laboratory, Portugal. DoubleSun® technology, with 1.9x concentration, showed an increase of 50% on the DC power of commercial modules at solar noon.

'''Abstract'''- A V-trough concentrator with a two-axis tracker system to increase the performance of photovoltaics was designed by the authors and installed on the roof-top of the building of the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics at Helwan in South Cairo. The V-trough concentrator system comprises two flat mirrors with dimensions 50 cm x 18 cm. They are fixed with the reflecting surfaces facing each other with a separation of about 11 cm, on a wooden table of 50 cm axis length. A sample of polycrystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells were fixed into the system, and similar solar cells of each type were fixed separate to the system, to estimate the electrical gain. The measurements were performed daily at different air masses for one complete year. The temperature of the solar cells in and out of the system were measured for comparison. Also, measurements for beam and global solar radiation and other meteorological conditions were recorded. The optical losses of the system were analyzed and details of collectable energy calculations are presented. The energy gain from the isolated contribution of the Vtrough concentrators is also evaluated.

'''Abstract:''' Partial shadowing has been identified as a main cause for reducing energy yield of grid-connected photovoltaic systems. The impact of the applied system configuration on the energy yield of partially shadowed arrays has been widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still much confusion especially regarding the optimal grade of modularity for such systems. A 5-kWp photovoltaic system was installed at K.U. Leuven. The system consists of three independent subsystems: central inverter, string inverter, and a number of AC modules. Throughout the year, parts of the photovoltaic array are shadowed by vegetation and other surrounding obstacles. The dimensions of shadowing obstacles were recorded and the expectable shadowing losses were estimated by applying different approaches. Based on the results of almost 2 years of analytical monitoring, the photovoltaic system is assessed with regard to shadowing losses and their dependence on the chosen system configuration. The results indicate that with obstacles of irregular shape being close to the photovoltaic array, simulation estimates the shadowing losses rather imprecise. At array positions mainly suffering from a reduction of the visible horizon by obstacles far away from the photovoltaic array, a simulation returns good results. Significant differences regarding shadow tolerance of different inverter types or overproportional losses with long module strings could not be confirmed for the system under examination. The negative impact of partial shadowing on the array performance should not be underestimated, but it affects modular systems as well as central inverter systems.
