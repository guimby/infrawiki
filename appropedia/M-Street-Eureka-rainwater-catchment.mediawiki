Nicole Vincent designed a rainwater catchment system for the residential property located at 1402 M St in Eureka, California. The owners of the house are principals with Democracy Unlimited of Humboldt County (DUHC).  DUHC is a non-profit organization that educates citizens about the illegitimate seizure of our authority to govern ourselves. They design and implement grassroots strategies that exercise democratic power over corporations and governments. DUHC seek to create a truly democratic society by provoking a non-violent popular uprising against corporate rule in Humboldt County that can serve as a model for other communities across the United States.If you would like to learn more about DUHC please check out there website at www.DUHC.org 

The rainwater catchment at 1402 M St is just the beginning of their move towards [[sustainability]]. Water collected from the system drip irrigates their vegetable garden,berries, fruit trees, and landscape.

==Literature Review== 
Rainwater catchment System, Rainwater Collection System, Rainwater harvesting process are words commonly used to describe the system we will design and construct. 
"Rainwater harvesting is the capture, diversion, and storage of rainwater for landscape irrigation and other uses." The most common type used today, is the roof catchment system. Roof catchment systems use gutters and downspouts, from which water flows by gravity into storage containers, which should be sized to collect as much rainfall as possible. An existing roof is used to capture rainwater that is gravity fed into a storage tank via gutters and down pipes(Texas A&M,2003). 
===Key requirements===
There are a number of key requirements common to all effective tank designs:
*A functional and water tight design
*A solid, secure cover to keep out insects, dirt and sunshine
*A screened inlet filter 
*A screened overflow pipe
*An extraction system that does not contaminate the water
*A soak away to prevent spilled water from forming puddles near the tank.
(Gould,1999)

Why spend the time and money to collect rainwater when the city provides you with as much water as a person needs? Well,there is a long investment payback period of about two years for a rainwater catchment system, however, there are many immediate benefits such as the following:
===Immediate Benefits===
*Landscaping accounts for 30 to 50 percent of a households total water use.
*Rainwater is free of salts and other minerals that can be harmful to root growth.
*It will help control erosion and flooding near the house.
*During times of drought or emergencies, a source of water will be available, when other sources are depleted or inaccessible 
(Texas A&M,2003).


==System Design==
Insert drawing of design  {{image needed}}                                                                               
=== Rainwater Collection Pathway===
# Rain falls onto the 541 ft<sup>2</sup> section of roof selected for collection and  down to the gutters where it then slides to each of the 4 downpipes. Halfway down it is diverted into PVC pipe that carries the water horizontally at a 2% slope into a 2500 gallon polythylene water tank. An outtake PVC pipe at the bottom of the tank extends ~20ft under the building through the crawl space and ends in the main yard. There are multiple spickets for separate drip irrigation hoses to water different sections of the yard and garden hoses.

===Foundation/Crash Pad===
The 104 in. by 104 in. pad gives enough space between the water tank and the house for maintenance or repair access. A perimeter of speed and corner blocks 8"x16" lined with rebar and filled with cement will create the support for the 2500 gallon water tank at 20,000 lb.

===Rainwater Storage Tank===
To determine the appropriate size of tank the following were considered
*How much water usage will the house use per month for their landscaping?
# What is the total area of the roof?
I measured the perimeter of the home Length*width  = total area  
*How much storage will they need for their rainwater supply to last throughout a dry season of 3 months?

The house has city water as a back up in case their storage of rainwater is depleted, however, 2000 gallons of stored rainwater will last them up to three months.

===Available water calculation===
Here is a simple worksheet to predict the amount of water available to collect:

# Multiply the catchment area  by 0.550 to determine gallons per one inch of rain
# Multiply the answer to #1 by the average annual rainfall in our area
# This number is an estimate for the number of gallons available to collect in one year

===Equation for Eureka, Ca===

Number of gallons available to collect in one year: 

<math>Catchment\ Area\ (ft2)\times \frac{0.550gal}{ft^2\cdot in} \times \frac{38.8 in\ (average\ Eureka\ rainfall)}{year}</math>

===Equation===

<math>541ft^2\times\frac{0.550gal}{ft^2\cdot in} \times \frac{38.8in}{year}=\frac{11,524 gal}{year}</math>

The system will store rainwater in a 2500 Gal polythylene Tank that is 86" or 7ft tall and has a 96" or 7.9ft Diameter . A tank this size can easily interfere with the usable space in the main yard.

===Gutters===
The gutters were cleaned of debris and overhanging branches before we worked on the down pipe connections.
===Downpipes===
Each downpipe has a diverter that allows the rainwater to flow to the tank or switch it when the tank is full to its original path through the existing downpipe. 
==Location==
All possible areas were considered for the location of the raincatchment system. The best location for the tank is outside of the main yard at the highest point of elevation. A tank this size  can easily interfere with the usable space in the main yard. 
A list of the advantages and disadvantages of every area were key to eliminating it down to one area.  
===Advantages===
*The tank is out of the way of the owners yard space.
*The site is at the highest point on their property.
*The downpipes are close and also hidden from the view of the owners.
===The Four Disadvantages of our chosen location===
*The gutters are on the second story 
*The ground has a moderate incline
*The tank is far from the main yard (how will they access the water?) We will send the outlet pipe under the smallest section of the house through the crawl space to the main yard. 
*There are two large shedding trees that hover over the systems potential gutters. These trees will be trimmed and consistently maintained to increase efficiency of the system.
===Flow===
The water pressure is affected by the tanks water level. As the tank fills the water pressure increases

==Materials/Cost==
DUHC's raincatchment system needed to be durable yet affordable.

==Construction==

===The Tank Pad===
Building a sturdy and level pad for the water storage tank is very important
When the water tank is at its full capacity of 2500 gallons it will weigh approximately 20,000lbs.   The tank should have the weight of the water evenly distributed. Any slope can cause more weight and therefore pressure on one location of the tank. 


===Materials===
*Ready mix Cement
*1/2 yard Sand
*2 yards Medium river rock
*Speed block 8"x16"
*Corner block 8"x16"
*1/2" Rebar

===Minimum Equipment Needed===
*Baseplate Tamper (rented)
*Site Leveler and string level
*Wheel Barrow and 5 gallon buckets
*Shovels

==Pad Construction==

Image:DUHC_Raincatchment_intake02.jpg|Fig.1a Each downpipe diverter piece was assembled with out glue
Image:DUHC_Raincatchment_intake01.jpg|Fig.1b 1.5" long PVC pieces were cut to bring flared fittings together 
IMAGE:Imageneeded.png|Fig.1c Every piece was laid flat on the ground below its final location on the wall.We assembled every piece possible without glue and marked the cuts needed with an inch for overlap added.
IMAGE:Imageneeded.png|Fig.1d On the ground we connected each piece of pipe after it was cut starting from the farthest downpipe from the tank and then worked our way over without glue.
Image:DUHC_Raincatchment_intake06.jpg|Fig.1e Each downpipe diverter piece was glued together
IMAGE:Imageneeded.png|Fig.2a For each downpipe we measured the distance between the lowest point of the downpipe diverter piece to the point where the house siding meets the cement wall(the ground is an inaccurate measuring point)this gave us the slope of our water pathway to the tank.
IMAGE:Imageneeded.png|Fig.2b Once the right slope was calculated we added the length of the diverter piece for each downpipe to its measurement in #4 plus an inch for overlap to get our downpipe diverter insertion cut.
Image:DUHC_Raincatchment_intake04.jpg|Fig.2c Starting with the farthest downpipe from the tank I cut the insertion point with a light duty hack saw then inserted the downpipe piece and attached the lower half of the downpipe to the diverter.
IMAGE:Imageneeded.png|Fig.2d With assistance I lifted and glued the first 10ft PVC pipe piece into the installed downpipe diverter piece and the polythylene strap was installed.
