==Abstract==
# This garden water sprinkler can be easily used to sprinkle water on a certain given region of garden by inserting a jet stream of water.
# Picture of completed print using [[image:Garden water sprinkler.jpg|300px]]
# The same print can be scaled up and made big for large garden areas.

== Bill of Materials==
# Requires less than 50gm of PLA to print this in full scale, estimated cost is the cost of material only. Comes out to be 1.10$

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
#

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Understanding of sprinkler system and basic designing skills using Openscad or Freecad

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Download the Openscad file or .stl file from the Thingiverse website.
# Load the file in Cura and scale it to required size according to use.
# This print needs support at some portions because it is hanging and may not form properly without support.
# Size of the entrance nozzle to be modified according to hose pipe and can be done easily by changing nozzle radius.
# Faster the hose pipe tightly onto the nozzle ensuring no leakage, and as the print is one piece there is no problem of it tearing apart or breaking down.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* The basic weight of the print is less to withstand the force of incoming water, some external installation to be used to keep in position.

== Cost savings==
* Easy to redesign and make required shape and size.
# 1.10$ for full scale of print.
