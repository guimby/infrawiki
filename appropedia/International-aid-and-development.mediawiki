Aid and development are terms with moving borders and much overlap.

== Aid ==
Aid tends to refer to [[official development assistance]] and sometimes to [[relief]] efforts by private charities. The emphasis of the word is on "help" when it is desperately needed, rather than [[empowerment]] or long-term [[capacity building]]. It may be in response to a [[crisis]], or 

The urgency sometimes leads to a demand for compromise, with [[principles of development|principles]] needing to be moderated in order to get things done ([[food]] distributed, and [[shelter]] erected and other logistical challenges

Note that some "aid agencies" are actually more focused on development work - the ''AID'' in [[USAID]] and [[AusAID]] both derive from "Agency for International Development".

== Development ==

Development, or "[[international development]]," tends to refer to longer term projects to overcome poverty, through many means such as improving [[public health]], [[education]] and [[productivity]]. These in turn have many facets - for example health is influenced by [[water]], [[sanitation]], [[handwashing]], [[indoor smoke]] from [[cookstoves]], [[nutrition]] and many more. Being longer term projects, there is less urgent [[empowerment]] or long-term [[capacity building]].
