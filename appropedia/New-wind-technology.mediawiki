The sky serpent has numerous rotors attached to a single generator. Each rotor captures the wind by even spacing and correct wind angle. Engineer Doug Selsam, former UC Irvine drop out, invented a sky serpent that he says is a “1,000 year-old design” of the original single blade turbine. By adding more rotors with the proper angle and spacing, he could generate more electricity.  For a lack of former education, Doug Selsam’s invention proves to be a revolutionary idea that has ultimately change wind energy. This idea is currently being build and tested by the California Energy Commission.

Engineers figured out that humpback whales tilt their fins at sharp angles to attain better lift in water. The company, WhalePower reconstructed the smooth blades to have ridges, based on the tubercles found on a whale’s back fin. The tubercles allows for a steeper fin tilt while also preventing stalling and too much drag. During periods of low wind, the blades having steeper angles, can hypothetically formulate more energy. Duke University fluid dynamics expert Laurens Howle, published a wind tunnel test report with president of WhalePower in 2004. The report concluded that adding these tubercle bumps decreased the stall angle up to 40 percent. The Wind Energy Institute of Canada tested the enhanced blade design in 2007. Envira-North Systems, a Canadian ventilation company, plan to be the first to use tubercle technology in industrial fans.
