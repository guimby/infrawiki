{{777}}

Graduate students (MY5777 and EE5777) will take the same lecture and projects as the undergraduates, however, they will also be expected to complete a Automated 3D printable scientific equipment design by the end of the semester. They will demonstrate their mods for the class.

For some ideas see: [https://github.com/mtu-most?tab=repositories Github MTU-MOST repositories], [[Open-source syringe pump]], [[Open-source metal 3-D printer]]
