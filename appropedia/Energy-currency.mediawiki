A [[currency]] backed by [[energy]]. This type of currency could be used to create an [[energy economy]] - a method for a [[local currency]] to be implemented in any [[community]]. The problem with many local currencies such as [[LETS]] <ref>[http://www.transaction.net/money/lets/ LETS]</ref> or [[Ithaca hours]] is that in businesses that are not a part of the program the currency is useless. However, if the currency can be used by ANY business or community member it can scale. A currency backed by [[renewable energy]] achieves this goal. The technology is finally available to make this happen.

Of the many advantages to such a system - adoption of a energy currency could correct the current [[market failure]] to address [[climate change]] by realigning economics with the reality of [[net energy]].

There has also been significant discussion in the literature about an "energy currency" based in the [[hydrogen economy]] but this is more focused around an economy run on hydrogen rather than say [[oil]] not as the the hydrogen being the means of exchange.
