*improve resolution (atomic)
Print with variable hotend nozzle sizes

*improve print speed (instantaneous)


*enhance material availability (all)
 
*reduce parts of the printer (1?)
 
*reduce costs of printer (free)
 

*reduce costs of materials (free)

*make it easier to use (McDonald's screen)
 

*make it easier to assemble (self)
*make it easier to maintain (none, unbreakable, self healing)

*make fully assembled products (anything - computer, car, smartphone, dinner)
 

*use functional printing materials (e.g. electronics)
*reduce waste (zero)
*use less energy (zero or ambient)
*quieter printing (soundless)
*ubiquitous printing (everywhere)
*print smaller (nanoscale)
*print bigger (apartment complex, Great Wall of China, planet?)
*enable auto calibration
*enable auto leveling
*enable auto monitoring
*enable quality control
*enable real-time feedback
*make it safer (infant approved)
*make is smell good (designer imposters?)
*make it from current waste products (CO2, flyash, spent fuel rods?)


*Improve filament lay down
