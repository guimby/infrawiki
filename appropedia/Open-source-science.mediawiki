[[image:OSL.jpg|right|thumb|[[Open-source Lab]]]]'''Open source science''' is science accomplished using an open source methodology.

Open source science includes <ref> The first four points were adapted from Dan Gezelter "What, exactly, is Open Science?", Posted on July 28, 2009 at
http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=269</ref>:
* Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data (e.g. [[MOST methods]])
* Public availability and reusability of that scientific data (e.g. the [[OSOTF]])
* Public accessibility and transparency of scientific communication.
* Using web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.
* Using and developing scientific or engineering [[open source software]] and [[open source hardware]] for use in doing science
