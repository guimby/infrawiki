To create more filtered feeds, there are two options (giving different feeds, either of which should work):
* Search for the topic on [[Wikinews:|Wikinews]], which should take you to the portal or category page. This will usually have an RSS feed link at the top.
* Visit [[Wikinews:Project:Syndication]] and enter the appropriate [[Wikinews:|Wikinews category]] name(s), e.g. "Category:Climate"
