'''China''' is the most populous nation on Earth. It covers a massive land area There is both great poverty and great wealth there. It is a nominally communist nation - largely free market in practice, but access to information is restricted and government regulation is extensive in many areas, notably the [[one child policy]] for reducing [[population growth]]. 

China is investing large amounts in [[sustainable technologies]] such as [[solar energy]], as well as low-carbon technologies such as [[carbon capture and storage]]. However, it continues to build large numbers of [[coal]]-fired power plants.
