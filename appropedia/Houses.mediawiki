Houses are where humans typically live. They exist to protect people from the elements, specifically [[Heating and cooling|temperature control]], blocking precipitation, and keeping out [[wildlife|wild animals]]. They also allow for a degree of privacy. They often include areas or rooms for [[cooking]], [[bathing]], [[hygiene]]/[[sanitation]] and sleeping. A house or shelter may contain only some, or even none of these elements. Houses may be constructed from a variety of materials, including [[wood]], [[soil|earth]], [[stone]], and [[metal]]. In most [[context]]s permanent buildings cost money to build. However, sometimes houses are built as a community service, such as with the organization Habitat for Humanity. In other contexts houses may be constructed using locally available resources or scavenged materials.
