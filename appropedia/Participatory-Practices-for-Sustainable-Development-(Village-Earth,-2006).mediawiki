Below are the outputs from the 2006 Participatory Practices for Sustainable Development (PPSD) Collaboration Plan, for [[Village Earth]]. Please feel free to use this space to add or expand on these. 

After looking over my workshop notes, I believe that the list below is more accurate. Can someone (Irma, Flora, Jeri) confirm this list?

Broad goals:

* Develop communications facility and strategy
* Define and prioritize network goals 
* Define and develop Village Earth capacity
* Develop fundraising goals
* Develop tools to affect policy
* Extend and evaluate projects
* Institutionalize the planning process
* Enhance tools for cultural empowerment
* Promote and strengthen local practices

Supporting our vision and goals, tangible projects are beginning to evolve, such as

* facilitate involvement of PPSD participants from Peru through Spanish translations,
* host a gathering of the Shepibo Nation,
* host an on-line auction to support Shepibo projects,
* prepare documents for and host January PPSD training in Pucallpa, Peru, 
* extend VE work to Armenia,
* develop a spiritual component to the VE curriculum.
