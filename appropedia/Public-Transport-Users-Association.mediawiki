* Working with other bodies and through the media to promote public transport and educate the community about the benefits of sustainable transport policies.
* Undertaking research into transport policies which will improve services and make Melbourne and regional Victoria a better place in which to live.

The PTUA is committed to:

* A sustainable economy
* A healthy ecology
* An equitable society

â€¦ where Victorians can go anywhere, anytime, using a community controlled public transport system that is convenient, efficient and safe.

== "Every ten minutes to everywhere" ==

A key campaign plank for better public transport is the PTUA's "Every ten minutes to everywhere" campaign. This is based on a policy of selected route extensions to suburban areas, and frequency improvements based on network upgrades. See the [http://www.ptua.org.au/campaigns/every10minutes/plan/ Every 10 minutes plan summary] on the PTUA's website.
