In January 2007, [[WikiGreen|WikiGreen.org]] merged its impressive collection of [[green wiki]] material into Appropedia. This is the announcement that was made:

| For the last few weeks, folks at WikiGreen and Appropedia have considered how best to collaborate on our shared goals. The decision: Assimilation!  So, in less time than it takes to build a [[Composting greenhouse provides hot water (original)|strawbale greenhouse]], nearly 1000 pages and more than 1000 images have been migrated from WikiGreen to Appropedia. ''Yay!'' It was a pretty clean process, but some tidying up continues.  Please pardon our "dust" as we wrap up the integration.  And, as usual, your help and feedback is valued!
