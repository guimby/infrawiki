==Purpose==
Students in Introduction to Design ([[Engr215]]), at [[Humboldt State University]], worked with [[Locally Delicious]] to design, build, test and disseminate projects that support healthy lifestyles among youths grades 4th through 6th and their families.  Building on the success of Locally Delicious' last cook book, they are creating a new cookbook, named [http://www.locally-delicious.org/Locally-Delicious/lunchbox-envy.html Lunchbox Envy], created with and for youth, families and schools across the United States.  The cookbook will be replete with supporting projects, such as the ones below.
