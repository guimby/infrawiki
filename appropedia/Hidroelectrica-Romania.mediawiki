{{reflist}}

Established in 2000, Hidroelectrica (hidroelectrică) is the leading provider of hydroelectric power in Romania. The company is state-owned, providing “…30% of the total production of the country according to hydraulicity year, while the volume of services is about 90% of the national power system.” [http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=13] Ziarul Financiar ranked Hidroelectrica 2nd place in “Top 100 most valuable companies in Romania” in 2012. 

Hidroelectrica strives to provide Romania with sustainable hydro energy by utilizing Romania's bounty of natural water resources, such as its lakes and rivers. “Hydropower, through its strong organizational culture, aims to consolidate its leadership position in the energy market in Romania through optimal development of production capacities and to become a major player in the regional energy market perspective.”[http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=13] Hidroelectrica is renowned for designing projects with the environment in mind. The projects are “…aimed to develop shared values related to protection of the environment and promotion of ecological activities in areas where the branches operate."

Seven strategically placed branches operate throughout Romania:

==History==
Although Hidroelectrica wasn't established until 2000, hydroelectricity has been a long-standing energy source in Romania. Hydropower has been used throughout the country since the late 19th century.

Sadu I was the first hydroelectric operation established in Romania (1896) and the third established in the world. In 1996 on the centennial anniversary of Sadu I, the hydroelectric plant was converted into a museum with fully-functioning equipment, making it the first museum of its kind in the country.

In 1972, Iron Gates I was erected on the Danube river after eight years of efforts. Iron Gates I is one of the largest energy plants in all of Europe, it's construction required the consent of both Yugoslavian and Romanian governments. Today, Iron Gates I is operated by Hidroelectrica and is a part of the SH Iron Gates  branch. "With those of its 1458.4 MW, SH Iron Gates is the branch with the largest installed capacity of Hidroelectrica." "Iron Gates Hydropower is one of the most important achievements in the history of Romanian hydropower, the essence of the creative spirit and inventive man, an example of technical collaboration, engineering between two peoples."[http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=108&article=116]<br>

Hidroelectrica has suffered in recent years due to drought in Romania, resulting in "...fourfold increase in water price machined; reduction in revenue as a result of drought and mismanagement."[http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=49&article=24]

== Sustainability in Romania ==
Romania may not be a world leader in "green technology" but the humble Eastern European country is making strides in developing sustainable technology. Hydropower only accounts for 30% of the fuel usage in Romania whereas a fossil fuel like coal accounts for about 39%. As Romanians stray away from fossil fuels and seek alternative energy options it is likely they will begin to rely more heavily upon sustainable methods like hydropower. Companies like Hidroelectrica seek "...to act in an environmentally responsible manner, involving also the local communities for public awareness and education, of respect for the environment." [http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=88&article=91]

On March 22nd, World Water Day is celebrated throughout Romania. The holiday was created by Hidroelectrica "...in observance of the principles of sustainable development of water resources exploitation." [http://www.hidroelectrica.ro/Details.aspx?page=88&article=91] In 2010, the theme was "Water–Pure Energy", focusing on water connection, sun, clean energy, and the environment.
== Goal ==
"Together we learn to protect, respect and understand the environment." With this slogan in mind, Hidroelectrica looks forward to a future of providing Romanian citizens with sustainable, hydroelectric power.
