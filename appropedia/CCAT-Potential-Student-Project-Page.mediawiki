= Potential Student Projects at CCAT<br>  =

Thank you for considering a project at [http://www.humboldt.edu/~ccat/ CCAT] (the student-run [http://www.humboldt.edu/~ccat/ Campus Center for Appropriate Technology ]at [http://www.humboldt.edu/ Humboldt State University]). With funding from [http://www.humboldt.edu/~hsuas/ Associated Students (AS)] and Instructionally Related Activities (IRA), CCAT is able to provide hands-on learning opportunities to students in 15 HSU classes each year. CCAT has a lot of resources on hand that can help you explore the realm of Appropriate Technology. In order for your project to flow smoothly, it is important to follow the guidelines and deadlines listed below.<br> 

== CCAT’s Criteria:  ==

A CCAT representative will provide a list of some potential projects on CCAT’s site. However, we are open to your ideas as well! 

In order to receive CCAT funding: 

*The project must be related to Appropriate Technology and the mission of CCAT, which is to demonstrate that living lightly on the earth is practical and rewarding.<br> 
*The project must be at CCAT, a community organization or place, or the project must serve as an educational tool or demonstration that reaches a significant amount of people/year. 
*The project must be interpretive. 
*A final report must be turned in to CCAT to be put on file. 
*If CCAT is unable to fund your entire project, other sources of funding or donations must be explored. 
*Projects must be able to be completed within semester time frame, unless specific circumstances of project are discussed with co-directors prior to submitting proposal. <br>

== Starting your Project  ==

It’s a good idea to get started on your project as soon as possible, as most projects take much longer than you would expect. As a general rule, expect projects to take at least three times longer than you originally estimated. CCAT will connect you to a co-director, CCAT employee, or community member who can best assist you with your project. This person will be your primary contact. Communication is the key! This person will assist you in project development and answering questions on issues such as using your IRA funds. While we will be assisting you throughout the project, it is your responsibility to complete it, and it is your instructor who ultimately grades you!<br> 

== Project Proposal &amp; Budget Estimate  ==

Once your project group (of any size) has developed an idea sufficiently, you need to turn in a brief project proposal (one per group) to CCAT. This proposal must include a detailed description of the project with accompanying sketches, a list of materials needed (as complete as possible), and a budget estimate. Create the budget estimate by sourcing and pricing the items on your materials list. Try to foresee non-material costs (like tool rentals) as well. Please see the attached example budget proposal. These documents allow us to ensure that all awarded projects receive funding. To ensure that there is enough time to complete your project, these proposals must be delivered to CCAT by the FOURTH WEEK of classes. We cannot award any funding until we receive your budget. When we determine which projects we are able to fund, we will contact you. Once you are awarded funding, the first thing you should do is schedule a meeting with your CCAT contact. They will orient you to CCAT’s resources and facility, and then you can get rolling on your project! Have lots of fun!<br> 
When submitting a project proposal to CCAT please include a budget page.  Click below for a link to our general budget template. From this link you can save a copy of the template as a Microsoft Word document. Also below is an example of a budget submitted to CCAT in the Spring of 2009.

== Spending Money on Your Project  ==


The following paragraphs describe how to spend money on CCAT projects. All expenditures need to be approved by the whole group. Purchases $50 and over should be made by your CCAT contact (a CCAT employee or co-director). For smaller purchases, you may buy the item. Then turn in to CCAT your original receipt, attached to a piece of paper with your name, project name and class written on it, as well as a brief statement of how the item is part of your project. Reimbursement usually takes at least a week. If you are confused about how to obtain an acceptable receipt, please ask prior to making the purchase.<br>For receipts to be accepted: 

1. Official printed receipt that has the name/address of company, an itemized account of purchases, a total, and proof of payment (i.e. account balance = $0).<br> 2. Hand-written receipts must be on company letterhead (or have a business card attached). They must include all of the same information as a printed receipt, and must be signed by the seller.<br> 3. If there is any name of purchaser on the receipt, it must be your name.<br> 4. If you use a credit card, include the printed slip.<br> 5. If you pay with a check, it is ideal to first make a copy of the check. Otherwise, you may have to have your bank send a copy. 

All purchases must be made before Finals Week!

== Potential Projects<!-- Don't change the next line unless you intend to change the categorization -->'''<br>'''  ==

*'''[[Image:Yurt1.jpg|thumb|146x116px]]Yurt Roof''': [[CCAT_yurt|CCAT's yurt]] roof is in need of repair. The structure is an example of a mongolian nomadic structure and has been on CCAT's site for many years. The original construction had a shingled roof but due to many factors the roof was changed over to canvas. The canvas was great for light and breathability but after many years of use it has leaks and mold. CCAT would like to change to roofing material of the yurt. Students would be responsible for researching different roofing materials, designing a new roof, and implementing the design, while allowing for natural light and maintaining water and weather proofing.<br> 
*'''Alternative Transport''': CCAT is in dire need of alternative transportation trailers and carts. Co-directors and employees need means for transporting groceries, tabling supplies, plants, soil, grounds supplies, etc. Past projects have built bike trailers but none have lasted. CCAT is looking for innovative bike trailers, pedal powered carts, or even creative push or hand carts.<br> 
*'''Appropriate Technology Kids Zone:''' The new downstairs of the CCAT building is a prime place for interpretive and interactive exhibits, especially for kids! This project will research and create an interactive and educational display or toy (found at such places like the S.F Exploratorium or Eureka Discovery Museum). Strong emphasis must be placed on durability and safety being that kids are rough and rugged! Past and potential projects have created hand generated musical instruments, mini-bicycle powered street lights, old fashioned water wheels that generate power for lights, recycled 'trash instruments' and wind power. Project ideas include solar blocks (ask CCAT for details) or creating a kid version of CCAT's pedal powered blender.<br>

*'''Compost Bin Roof System: '''CCAT has a large 4 bin compost system. The bins are made from trex lumber and each holds a different stage of compost. A removable wooden frame covered with metal roofing sits on top of the bins to shield the compost from excess water. The roof system is too heavy and hard for one person to move to dump compost. Student would design new roofing system that would allow for ease of access.<br> 
*'''[[Image:Set - 3 002.jpg|thumb|149x115px]]Outdoor Kitchen''': CCAT's patio houses a cob oven, a brick fireplace, a rocket stove, and a barbeque has begun to be put in. This project would fix the fire place and smoke stack, finish the construction of the barbeque, build in outdoor kitchen storage, and design the area to be an efficient outdoor cooking space.<br> 
*'''Interpretative/Signs''':CCAT is always in need of creative and engaging interpretative signs throughout the house and grounds. Signs could be made of wood, painted, metal, reused materials, etc

#Develop a phamplet for CCAT's self guided tour for both on the grounds and in the house
#Signs to identify and explain CCAT's various technologies
#Plant signs that identify plant and tell of uses: medicinal, edible, building, etc

*'''Restoration and Landscaping''':

#This project focuses on CCAT's north-east zone behind the bamboo grove. Remove invasive species and remediate zone by planting a combination of native species, medicinal herbs, beneficial and aesthetic bushes, flowers, and shrubs to increase diversity and restore zone. Project will include aspects of landscape design and [[permaculture]]. Be creative with the space by incorporating art, sitting, or other ideas for use of the space. <br> 
#A second project would work on CCAT's southern border and entrance and include stabilizing slope, uncovering and finish southern path, landscaping of flowering bushes, trees, and perinnels, potential entrance arches, and open to creative design and landscaping.
