'''Rotating Savings and Credit Associations''', or '''ROSCAs''', are a popular form of informal saving in many countries and can be considered a form of [[informal economy|informal]] [[microfinance]]. 

ROSCAs operate on [[trust]]; yet even in societies where levels of trust on financial matters are relatively low, it is possible for ROSCAs to be popular and effective.<ref name="CW">This is based on observation by [[User:Chriswaterguy]] in Indonesia.{{more sources}}</ref> This is likely to be due to:
* the relative effectiveness of social pressure in some more traditional societies<ref name="CW"/>
* the relative difficulty of saving without an enforced saving mechanism (when the [[cultural]] tendency might be to spend the money, and social pressure from family or friends is to give or lend them the money)<ref name="CW"/> (Note that cultural tendencies and practices may vary widely, even within the same region, or between countries at a similar economic level.)
* less trust in the formal banking system than in countries with well established and regulated banking and stable economies<ref name="CW"/>
* small size of savings being impractical in the formal banking sector, perhaps suffering from bank fees.
* the desirability of socializing and improving relationships with peers, and getting support and advice on financial matters.{{fact}}
* the possibility of gaining access to the full amount of money before the individual has saved up that full amount (i.e. it sometimes acts as a form of credit, without interest charges). 

==Terminology==
'''ROSCA''' (or sometimes '''rosca''') is the term usually used in the development finance field; different languages have their own words which typically are not direct translations of the English term, such as ''arisan'', in [[Indonesia]]n (which is translated in Indonesian-English dictionaries as "savings club" or "regular social gathering for purposes of conducting a lottery".)
