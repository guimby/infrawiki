Measuring spoons for [[Oral rehydration therapy]]

== Problem ==

"[[Diarrhea]] is one of the main causes of death in small children. However, most of these children actually die from dehydration-the loss of too much water." <ref name="ChildToChild"> http://healthwrights.org/books/HHWL/HHWLchapt15.pdf </ref>

== Summary ==

"Today, most health planners recognize that oral rehydration -or giving liquid by mouth- is the best way to manage most cases of diarrhea and dehydration...in most parts of the world, the sugar and salt needed for homemade mix are common household items. Once they learn how, families can make and use the drink right away whenever it is needed-without having to depend on outsiders...[a] spoon can be made from old bottle caps and beer or juice cans-or from other materials commonly found in villages. And if they lose a spoon, they can easily make another one" <ref name="ChildToChild"> http://healthwrights.org/books/HHWL/HHWLchapt15.pdf </ref>
