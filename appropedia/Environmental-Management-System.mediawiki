==Environmental Management System==

===Issue===
How does an organization establish a comprehensive approach to minimize your impact on the environment through minimizing waste, reducing energy consumption, and making more efficient use of your resources which all lead to costs savings?

===Solutions===
An Environmental Management System (EMS) provides the organisation’s management with a structured framework for identifying, evaluating, managing and improving its environmental performance. It helps to ensue that the organisation’s overall environmental goals, as set out in its environmental policy, are implemented throughout the organisation and that employees, contractors and suppliers know their roles and responsibilities in helping the organisation to achieve them.
