The working principle of the '''Captive Column''' structure is to support the main load-carrying column elements totally along their entire length so they cannot buckle or move in any direction relative to each other. This is accomplished by holding them captive between core elements inside and skin elements outside. These three basic elements then work together to resist any type of loading applied to the structure.
