==Abstract==
The idea of this OSAT is a small, easily producible, hand sized, bulb and seed planter. The current opening fits groupings of seeds or a small bulb, but can easily be sized to fit a larger bulb as well.

The interior of the planter is designed to have a ridged blade edge for ripping and tearing into dirt with a twisting motion. As the designers home is currently covered in permafrost, testing has not yet occurred.

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
* [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
*Knowledge of running the used style of printer
*Use of opescad
*use of cura
*Basic horticultural knowledge

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Download the file from the thingiverse page
# Load and slice the g-code from the .stl of the part
# Print, carefully cut supports for handhold, cut any loose printing
# Go plant some seeds!

* Estimated print time: 2hr 30min (20% infill)

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
*Print must be at 20% or above fill to ensure satisfactory strength of the part when tearing into harder soils
*As the base of the print is smaller than the upper edge of the print, printing the part upside down (slice in cura) could be helpful to ensure the part remains fixed to the print base

== Cost savings==
* Estimated costs
$0.80 in fillament
* Store equivalent
$4.97 from amazon.com
