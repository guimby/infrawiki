Across the London Borough of Ealing there are 63 allotments sites. Most are council owned but a few are independent. The allotments in this part of London dramatically increased during WWII as part of the government effort to feed the nation. To encouraged the uptake of an allotment plots by people of whom had no access to a garden themselves, a campaign was waged under the slogan “Dig for Victory”. Towards the later end of the 20th century they became popular again amongst the growing ethic communities, as a source of some of their more familiar and traditional vegetables which were otherwise unobtainable in British shops. Some local organisations have now formally recognised some of the benefits that come from working on allotments and actively encourage their use. Ealing Council has also signed up to the Unitary Development Plan which it is hoped will safeguard the existing allotments from building developers. <ref>[[wikipedia:Ealing parks and open spaces#Allotments]]</ref>
