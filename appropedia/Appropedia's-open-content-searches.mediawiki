Open content searches are planned, if and only if they provide a service which doesn't exist elsewhere.

The only search already operating (as at February 2008) is [[Appropedia's Public Domain Search]].

Further work is planned on a search or searches for [[open content]] which is not [[public domain]] (exploring what value can be added by a new custom search, and creating one if appropriate).

Contribute here by editing this page, or contact [[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] on his [[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk page]].


Open content searches might be useful for [[porting]] content to Appropedia, provided the licenses are compatible (probably after GFDL and CC-by-sa are made compatible). 

== Resources for building the searches ==
