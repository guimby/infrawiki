'''Secateurs''' are a requisite addition to the gardener's tool set. Other names by which secateurs are known include hand pruners and pruning shears. They are useful for cutting flowers, trimming plants and keeping branches under control.

When purchasing or borrowing secateurs, check first that they fit your hand comfortably. After a lot of use, you'll appreciate having done this!

== Uses for secateurs ==

Secateurs are sharp and strong snips or scissors that can cut through the small branches of shrubs and young trees. They are also used to harvest some garden produce, such as large vegetables (with thick stalks, such as [[pumpkins]]) and fruits such as [[grapes]] and [[peaches]].

Secateurs can be helpful for deadheading spent flowers.

== Care and maintenance ==

Secateurs must be cleaned after each use, to remove plant sap, dirt and debris. Ensure that they are completely dry before storing.

Keep the blades sharp. Follow the manufacturer's care instructions.

Store in a safe position out of the reach of children. If they came with a sheath, use this to store the secateurs in.
