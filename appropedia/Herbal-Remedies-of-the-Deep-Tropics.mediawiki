'''Herbal Remedies of the Deep Tropics'''

We've all heard of the fantastic variety of life forms in the [[tropical forest]]. It is the cradle of all terrestrial life on Earth. And, as is to be expected, this almost infinite variety is a potential source of an almost infinite variety of [[herbal remedies]]. The [[sustainable]] community in the tropics that does not take advantage of what is known in this field is putting its people in danger. 

Also sustainable communities in the [[temperate zones]], besides taking full advantage of their own native remedies, should cooperate with communities in the tropics to exchange herbal remedies. Little energy is used in transporting a couple of kilos of dried leaves!
