"We are social creatures, our behaviours are shaped and constrained by social norms and expectations. Negotiating change is best pursued at the level of groups and communities. Social support is particularly vital in breaking habits, and in devising new social norms and more sustainable patterns of consumption. Government can play a vital role in nurturing and supporting community based social change."

=== About CASwiki ===

Community action for sustainability, or CASwiki, is information and knowledge sharing, but with a focus on what might be useful to community groups and active citizens. [[Join community action for sustainability|You can help]]. What can we do to make our communities more sustainable and in support of environmental, social and economic wellbeing? / [[About community action for sustainability|About CASwiki]] - [[Join community action for sustainability|Join]]

==== Why grow CASwiki ====

"We start with the simple proposition that citizens should be able to influence decisions which affect the places and communities in which they live, work and visit."  

Sustainability isn't just something for experts. It's about everyone's quality of life and we all have a part to play.

CASwiki aims to help link up community and personal action for sustainability worldwide. ''...[[Why grow community action for sustainability?|more]]''


Knowledge sharing can help! It can help with finding contacts, making connections and networking. As well as information about places CASwiki shares information and knowledge about 29 Community action for sustainability topics (what we can do - see right hand column) and [[CASwiki resources|Resources]] to help action.
