The basic components of a pit latrine are the pit, ideally 4-5 meters deep, a cover slab with a hole through which users defecate into the pit and a superstructure, sufficient to ensure privacy and provide protection from the weather. It must be possible to clean the slab. Partly for this reason, most slabs are made of concrete but it is possible to use a smaller concrete or plastic ‘SanPlat’  laid on top of a latrine cover made from wood and other ‘natural’ materials. <ref>http://water.worldbank.org/shw-resource-guide/infrastructure/menu-technical-options/pit-latrines</ref>
