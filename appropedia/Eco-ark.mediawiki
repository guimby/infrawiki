==What is an Eco-Ark?==
Similar to an [[Ecovillage]], except the focus is concentrated on preservation and propagation of botanical life forms rather than [[sustenance farming]]. Focus is on [[propagation]] and redistribution of plant species, with [[food]], [[fiber]], and [[medicine]] as by-products.

==Characteristics of an Eco-Ark==
*Self-Sustaining Hydration: Location should provide sufficient [[water]] to maintain plant life with little or no human intervention.

*[[Permaculture]] Design: Planting of proper species suited to a specific climate that can self propagate in a particular region.

*[[Accessibility]]: The Eco-Ark should be located where it can be beneficial to those who wish to make use of it.
