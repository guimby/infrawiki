'''An Excuse Action''' by Yudithia Chen
An Excuse Action is inspired by Ghea Annisa, one of the group members of the Green Indonesia Youth Coalition (KOPHI) participant during the Pre-Congress I KOPHI. By doing this action, they informed people about the availability of trash around them. On May 1, 2011 known as the International Labor Day, the group carried the [[Excuse Action]] around the Hotel Indonesia located in [[Jakarta]] by collecting trash. This action is quite risky because in the same place, there was a big demonstration of workers.  Although felt like a super-minority groups in a crowd of workers who were fighting for their fate, they started the action by collecting the garbage in the middle of a crowd and put the garbage in trash bags. However, words of "excuse me" is their main weapon. Quite surprise that not only demonstrators left rooms for them to collect the rubbish around the demonstration site, but also the leader of demonstrators participated in this action. He yelled the demonstration participants to also pay attention for not littering while doing demonstrations.

'''The Garbage from Legislative Campaign'''
Compared to previous elections, the 2009 Election produced more [[garbage]] during the campaign since each legislative candidate was being expected to campaign by her/himself.  The results, open spaces were full with banners and stickers in all over the country.
If we observed and read the content of each sticker or banner more carefully, we found some funny statements. For examples, “I am happy if you just look at my photo. If you remember me, I will be happier”, ”Asking your blessing”, “I've spent hundreds of millions for the campaign. Whatever it takes, I will do to win (though re-election)”.
Not uncommon people put his family member, ancestor or anyone else who is better known than themselves. They claimed to be descendants of King Siliwangi, X's wife, or father or Y. One candidate put a picture of a deceased person and painted it with white. This phenomenon shows that the candidates had no concern with the environment.
