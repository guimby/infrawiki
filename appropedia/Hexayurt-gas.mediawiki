Gas will be used for [[Cookers|cooking]] and [[Heating and cooling|heating]] applications.

Substitute for natural gas infrastructure (pipes and plants, trucked in propane) with:

* A [[wood gasification stove]].  http://files.howtolivewiki.com/wood_gasification_stove_clip.mov has a  (2M) video of the wood gasification stove from http://Spenton.net in operation.

Wood [[gasification]] stoves use sophisticated combustion engineering realized in the form of cheap sheet metal forced air stoves. Two AA cells power ten hours of cooking, with a peak heat output of 3KW from finger-sized twigs. Wood gasification stoves are low emissions because the fuel is burned either as gas (volatiles boiled out of the fuel) in super-abundant oxygen blown in by the fan, or as charcoal similarly burned in abundant oxygen.

Wood gasification stoves are rated as ten times more efficient than [[Three rock fire|open fires]], and three times more efficient than high-efficiency clay stoves.

Financial model:

* $20 or less per stove, one per household

Fuel costs are low, perhaps $1 per household per week or less. In a small and well insulated shelter or home, even this relatively modest heating device should provide most or all of the heat required -- even through the winter -- in most climates.
