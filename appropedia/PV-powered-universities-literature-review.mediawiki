'''Abstract''' The cut-off of any subsidy or feed-in tariff that incentives the installation of new renewable energy systems which are close to the grid parity, is a reality in most of the European countries, but in the recent years the grid parity has worsened because of the global economic crisis. In the case of Spain, in addition to the economic problems, the photovoltaic sector has been dramatically damaged through a changeable regulatory framework, an excessive bureaucracy and the inclusion of additional fees or possible back-up tolls that are very prejudicial for the deployment of this sector. Nowadays, the current Spanish legislation mentions the possibility of self-consumption (totally or partially) of the electricity generated by PV or any renewable energy systems but, up to the date of this work, the law that regulates the administrative, technical and economic conditions for the net-metering of the electrical energy produced within the consumer׳s network, is still under a draft stage. In this paper it is analyzed the case of the University of Jaen, where it has been identified and simulated several PV systems on the roofs and parking lots of the University Campus, and considering the current electrical tariffs (hourly defined for the case of high power and high voltage consumers), it has been done a cost and economic analysis. As a result, it has been obtained an average Levelised Cost of Energy around 0.125 € kWh−1, a discount payback time of 17.5 years or less, a positive Net Present Value and a nominal Internal Rate of Return of 8.48% in the worst case. Beyond that, it has been carried out a sensitivity analysis of the factors that have more influence in the profitability of these systems, like the initial investment cost, the PV electricity yield, additional taxes and the variations in the electricity price market.
* '''The methods used for economic analysis in this paper are the net present value, the discounted payback time, and the internal rate of return'''
* '''The PV electricity cost production has been estimated through the concept of Levelised cost of electricity in order to compare photovoltaic technology with other sources of energy'''
* '''The most sensitive parameter with influence in the variation of the LCOE is considered to be the initial investment cost per Kwp of PV grid-connected system'''

'''Abstract''' With more and more distributed generators (photovoltaic and wind) and distributed energy resources being integrated into power networks, traditional electricity grids may be replaced by smaller and more efficient grids called microgrids. Especially in recent years, there has been a significant increase in photovoltaic (PV) installations in Australia. As such, potential for microgrids to continue supply power to loads during a blackout was evident. However, microgrids have posed a concern for utilities as they do not provide utilities the same ability as the conventional grid to regulate microgrid voltage and frequency, and later possibly interfere with restoration of normal electricity supply. This paper investigates the feasibility of forming a microgrid in the University of Queensland for continuous electricity supply during power outage by utilizing its PV and storage systems. A simple but effective load shedding algorithm based on existing schemes and future technologies has been implemented. It also demonstrates how microgrid resynchronization can be achieved.
* '''The intermittency of PV power supply may threaten microgrid integrity; therefore, in order to maintain system voltage and frequency within limits, loads are to be shed according to its priority'''
* '''Under frequency load shedding works by disconnecting predefined loads when system frequency drops below a set threshold value'''
* '''Genetic algorithm is used for load shedding and it fulfills all restrictions set by designer, minimizes disconnection of loads, and prevents disconnection of high priority loads'''
* '''Smart buildings has enabled crucial information such as local real time electricity consumption and generation to be gathered; therefore, engineers will be able to make better decisions regarding switching of loads or changing power generation in real time'''
* '''As soon as normal supply of power resumes, it is necessary for the microgrid to resynchronize with the main grid as microgrid operation in the long run is not sustainable'''
* '''The most common closed loop method for resynchronization is the synchronously rotating frame phase locked loop'''
* '''An effective load shedding algorithm is the key to maintaining microgrid integrity by ensuring balance between power supplied and demanded'''
* '''As real power output from the PV arrays can not be controlled power mismatch may occur, and in order to count for power mismatch, a user defines apparent power safety margin and real power margin, and they are applied to the battery storage system'''
* '''When utility supply return, the main circuit breaker cannot be closed instantly due to phase difference in voltage waveforms. Instead microgrid frequency is increased or decreased to minimize the phase difference'''

'''Abstract''' U-I characteristics - or electric power - as function of electrical voltage or current - of a solar panel (PV cell or panel) gives important information for developers, engineers and users. From this reason to get U-I plot or characterization of the electric power of a solar panel plays important role at the tests. In this paper a new and easy experimental method for U-I measurement (indirectly measured electric power data) for PV cells will be introduced. The new idea describes a simple, fast and reliable way how to get U-I characteristics - or power properties - of PV cells in a laboratory at a university using basic experimental tools.
* '''In order to specify the optimum value of the operating point the maximum power output of the PV panel has to be determined at given and constant irradiation'''
* '''One of the most general specific functions for description of a PV cell is the U-I (voltage-current) characteristics which belongs to given light irradiation'''
* '''The mechanical holder for PV panels is called as adjustable measurement stand. The holder is a rotating and tilting mechanical stand, and rotation around the vertical axis is possible in 360 degree'''
* '''The minimum azimuth angle is 30 degree and the maximum is around 90'''
* '''In this article outlets for electrical signals of the PV tables are positioned in inner laboratory using cable connections, and for each PV panel a user friendly measurement place was designed and built on the laboratory wall. The measurement places give output voltage signals of the PVs through special inverters for the users, this way users can connect their meter and measure the voltage data'''

'''Abstract''' The tilt angle of the photovoltaic (PV) array is the key to an optimum power generation. Solar panels or PV arrays are most efficient, when they are perpendicular to the sun's rays. Optimal tilt angle of solar panel are different at places of the earth. In Ulaanbaatar that is coldest capital city, the optimal tilt angle is 30 degrees in summer and 60 degrees in winter. By the calculation, the average tilt angle of the solar panel in Ulaanbaatar that can produce annually large amount energy is around 45 degrees. But 45 degrees of tilt angle are not so suitable due to snow and ice accumulation on the solar panel during winter in Ulaanbaatar.
* '''If the tilt angel of solar panel is around 45 degrees the snow and accumulation on the solar panel will not be melted by sun's rays and will not be blown by wind'''
* '''Daily power generation without snow and ice accumulation on the solar panels is three times larger than solar panels with snow and ice accumulation''' 
* '''Snow and ice will not be accumulated on the solar panel surface when the tilt angel of the solar panel is around 60 degrees in Ulaanbaatar'''
* '''The power generation from PV modules is affected by tilt angel, irradiance, and module temperature'''

'''Abstract''' This paper presents a new approach to computing the optimal tilt angle for photovoltaic (PV) panels. The influence of cloudy conditions on the tilt angle is explored. It is demonstrated that more energy can be extracted from the PV system in cloudy conditions when the tilt angle of the panel is decreased compared to when the panel is aimed to be facing directly normal to the sun. Validation for fixed tilt, south-facing panels and for 2-axis tracking panels is presented by numerical simulations.
* '''It has been demonstrated that more energy can be extracted from the PV system in cloudy conditions when the tilt angel of the panel is decreased'''
* '''The benefits of simplified formulas are that the tilt angels can be calculated based on historically known quantities, and there will be increased PV harvesting energy yield due to higher PV energy output in cloudy conditions'''

'''Abstract''' Lightning strikes can affect photovoltaic (PV) generators and their installations, involving also the inverter's electronics. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the risk connected to lightning strikes in order to adopt the correct protective measures for the system. The Standard IEC (EN) 62305-2 reports the procedures for the risk calculation and for the choice of proper lightning protection systems. Usually the technical guidelines suggest protecting with SPDs (surge protective devices) both DC and AC sides of the PV installation. The paper estimates overvoltages due to lightning discharges and evaluates the actual need of lightning protection measures on the basis of the results of the risk analysis and of the protection costs. The paper in the first part presents the procedure for the evaluation of the risk connected to lightning strikes according to the Standard IEC EN 62305-2; then it applies the procedure to typical PV installations, analyzing risks and risk components which have to be kept into account. In the second part the paper studies the surge overcurrents to be expected on LV systems, induced voltages caused by direct flashes and by flashes near the PV installation. Approximated equations for the calculation of induced voltages and currents are given for different types of LPS (lightning protection systems) and lightning flashes. In the last part of the paper the methodology is applied as an example to a practical case and some conclusions are given.
* '''The installation of PV modules on buildings does not increase the risk of a lightening strike, but there may be an increased damage for the electric installation of the building'''
* '''Due to the wiring of the PV lines inside the buildings, strong conducted and radiated interferences may result from lightening currents'''
* '''Installation of overvoltage protection is important on both sides of the power electronic device'''
* '''To reduce the risk of damages due to the lightening strike a coordinated SPD system, and an external LPS could be installed'''

'''Abstract''' Photovoltaic systems are currently being considered as competitive sources of power energy around the world including Malaysia. However, the main problem hampering the expansion of solar energy is its high cost per kWh. This research is carried out to study the economic feasibility of a 16kWp grid connected photovoltaic (PV) system at Green Energy Research Center (GERC), UiTM Shah Alam. The PV system comprises of 1) A 6 kWp single phase PV system and 2) A 10kWp three phase PV system. The analysis is carried out considering the system will be sold to power utility and paid at the Feed-in tariff (FiT) set by Sustainable Energy Development Authority Malaysia (SEDA). A financial model is developed to calculate the expected Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project over its expected lifetime. The effects of uncertainties i.e. solar irradiance, investment cost, discount rate and inverter failure on the profitability of the PV system are studied using 1) sensitivity analysis and 2) probabilistic analysis. Sensitivity analysis shows that the profitability of the PV project is most affected by solar irradiation followed by FiT, investment cost and discount rate. The probabilistic analysis shows that considering the current FiT and with no inverter failure, the confidence level of getting the IRR greater than Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return (MARR) of 12% is 75%. On the other hand, for the case with inverter failure, the confidence level of getting the IRR greater than 12% is 25%.
* '''A feasibility study is performed to investigate whether the project would be profitable or not considering various uncertainties over its lifetime'''
* '''Financial model used in this study is the discounted cash-flow method which calculates the net present value and the internal rate of return of the investment'''
* '''The effects of uncertainties on the profitability of investment are analyzed using sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis'''
* '''A risk assessment technique is also incorporated in the model to calculate the confidence level of getting the NPV and IRR greater than the target value'''

Yousefi, “Economical Design of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants With Optimum Availability,” IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 61, no. 7, pp. 3399–3406, Jul. 2014.</ref>]====

'''Abstract''' This paper presents an algorithm for the economical design of a utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) power plant via compromising between the cost of energy and the availability of the plant. The algorithm inputs are the plant peak power and the price of inverters with respect to their power ratings. The outputs are the optimum inverter ratings and the interconnection topology of PV panels. This paper introduces the effective levelized cost of energy (LCOE) (ELCOE) index as the core of the proposed design algorithm. ELCOE is an improved index based on the conventional LCOE that includes the availability of a power plant in economical assessments. The conventional LCOE index determines centralized topology (e.g., 1-MW inverter for a 1-MW PV power plant) for minimizing the energy generation cost, whereas based on ELCOE, a multistring topology (e.g., a 1-MW PV plant consists of fifty 20-kW inverters) despite of higher investment cost becomes the economically winning topology. Given the price of commercially available PV inverters at present, the case studies in this paper show that, for 0.1–100-MW PV power plants, the economical ratings of inverters range from 8 to 100 kW. The recently installed PV power plants confirm the feasibility of the calculations based on the suggested algorithm.
* '''PV plant has four topologies: centralized, ac modular, string, and multistring'''
* '''The type of PV invertes and there interconnection methods have impact on features of PV power plants in terms of efficiency, investment cost, and reliability in energy generation'''

'''Abstract''' PV based large scale energy generation has spread significantly. In spite of similar technical parameters the amount of yearly produced energy may differ by notable percents. It results from the operation of solar trackers and also from the different spectral behavior of the different PV panel types. In this paper we introduce a novel on site spectral sensitivity measurement method. The spectral characteristic is recalculated from separate power maximum measurements, where the measurements are made by spectrally different natural irradiation (sunrise, noon, foggy, cloudy, etc.).

'''Abstract''' Many university and government campuses have rapidly expanding “Green Energy” programs. These programs often include a mix of solar photovoltaic power, wind power, fuel cells, and other low-carbon sources. Unfortunately, practical experience has shown serious problems with these sources powering sensitive fab tools. A better solution is to operate the fab tools from traditional utility-provided power, then use the “green” power to operate less-sensitive fab support equipment: chillers, CDA compressors, CDW pumps, and so forth. This less-sensitive equipment often consumes half or more of the entire fab energy budget, and is readily adaptable - with some small technical effort - to tolerate the power disturbances found on a “green” grid.
* '''Practical experience has shown serious problems with renewable sources powering sensitive fab tools'''
* '''Switching frequency of a DC/AC inverter in PV installation create a large level of noise which can significantly affect metrology tools'''
* '''Green energy has a higher source impedance than utility energy which means that disruptive voltage sags tend to be deeper and longer'''

'''Abstract''' The importance of predicting the output power of Photovoltaic (PV) plants is crucial in modern power system applications. Predicting the power yield of a PV generation system helps the process of dispatching the power into a grid with improved efficiency in generation planning and operation. This work proposes the use of intelligent tools to forecast the real power output of PV units. These tools primarily comprise dynamic neural networks which are capable of time-series predictions with good reliability. This paper begins with a brief review of various methods of forecasting solar power reported in literature. Results of preliminary work on a 5kW PV panel at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, is presented. Focused Time Delay and Distributed Time Delay Neural Networks were used as a forecasting tool for this study and their performance was compared with each other.

'''Abstract''' The most common type of photovoltaic (PV) installation in residential applications is the centralized architecture. This realization aggregates a number of solar panels into a single power converter for power processing. The performance of a centralized architecture is adversely affected when it is subject to partial shading effects due to clouds or surrounding obstacles, such as trees. An alternative modular approach can be implemented using several power converters with partial throughput power processing capability. This paper presents a detailed study of these two architectures for the same throughput power level. The study compares the overall efficiency of these two different topologies, using a set of rapidly-changing real solar irradiance data collected by the Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This provides an opportunity to study both schemes using real measured data. The output power of both the topology is compared against the panel ideal power. Hence, the efficiency is overall in nature. The electrical efficiency is another form of computation which uses the panel maximum available power as input instead of panel ideal power. The paper uses overall efficiency for all analysis. The buck converter along with the Perturb & Observe maximum power point tracking algorithm were selected to perform the study. A detail power loss analysis is also presented in the paper. Analytical results are validated through detailed computer simulations using the Matlab/Simulink mathematical software package.
* '''The modular architecture has resulted in more overall efﬁciency than its counterpart CMPPT under shading conditions such as clouds'''
* '''P&O fails to track the maximum power under a sharp change in irradiation patterns even in the case of modular topology'''
* '''The sharp changes only occurs for a very short duration, once the solar irradiance settles to a new value, the MPPT will stabilize to new operating point'''
* '''The change in temperature will not likely to affect the function of MPPT because the power electronics operates much faster than the weather or temperature change'''

'''Abstract''' The majority of large-scale solar farms have so far been constructed in the Southwest of the United States due to the intense insolation there. However, the high cost of electricity and the desire to increase the portion of renewables in the electric supply have generated interest in developing large-area plants in other areas. The environmental impact of building such large-scale solar farms in the northern United States has not yet been evaluated; we do so in this paper. This work discusses the life-cycle environmental impact from constructing and operating a 37-MWp solar-photovoltaic power-plant on the forested campus of Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York. We use the results from our assessments of its life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases are then compared with those generated by similar plants in other regions to assess the net impacts of photovoltaics' life cycles in areas where trees are removed to accommodate the power plant.

'''Abstract''' Partial shading of photovoltaic modules is a widespread phenomenon in all kinds of Photovoltaic (PV) systems. In many cases the PV arrays get shadowed, completely or partially, by the passing clouds, neighboring buildings and towers, trees or the shadow of one solar array on the other, etc. This further leads to nonlinearities in characteristics. In this study, the simulation and experimental results of uniform and partial shading of PV modules are presented. Different shading pattern have been investigated on series and parallel connected photovoltaic module to find a configuration that is comparatively less susceptible to electrical mismatches due shadow problems. Simscape simulation model is employed to model the solar cell taking into account its series and parallel resistance.
* '''The output characteristics of a PV module get more complicated if the entire array does not receive uniform insolation'''
* '''A bypass diode can be added in parallel with solar cell in order to overcome the effects of partial shading'''
* '''Shaded cells absorb power and act as a load which means that power is dissipated in shaded cells as heat and cause hot spots'''

'''Abstract''' The purpose of this paper is to present a practical setup which is used to determine the availability of power from a singular stationary photovoltaic panel for variable atmospheric conditions in the Vaal Triangle, located in southern Gauteng, South Africa. Atmospheric conditions in this paper are characterized by air pollution and cloud movements, both which impact negatively on the operation of photovoltaic panels as shown by a number of scientific studies. Power regulation is achieved through the use of a DC-DC converter with a constant load resistance being employed to ensure reliability of the results for repeated measurements. The performance of the system is determined by considering the amount of time in which the DC-DC converter delivers power to the load resistance over a one week period, given as a percentage. Initial results indicate that the performance of this system varies by as much as 26% over a three month period stretching from March through May of 2011.

'''Abstract''' The electrical characteristics of a 60W, 12V PV panel is presented on this paper for geographical location of Latitude = 23° 43'N and Longitude = 90°25'E (Islamic University of Technology, Gazipur, Dhaka, Bangladesh). The open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the panel are measured and recorded at an interval of three minutes along with the total solar irradiation. The total solar irradiation is measured using the device “UNIKLIMA VARIO” commissioned in the automatic weather monitoring station of the university. Based on the weekly data voltage-times and current-time curves are plotted for three different seasons from which the total available electrical power curve is also derived. Then the electrical efficiency of the panel is calculated using the solar irradiation data. The objective is to observe the variation of efficiency for different weather and atmospheric condition. The voltage generated by a PV panel depends on the geographical location of the site, time of the year, time of the day and local weather condition. The geographical and climatic condition of the chosen site is suitable for PV power systems. The electrical design of the array is influenced by the factors such as- sun intensity, sun angle, load matching for maximum power and operating temperature of the panel. Based on the experiments it has been observed that with increased radiation, the panel current is increased linearly. With a constant irradiation, the output voltage of the panel is increased for a decrease in the panel temperature or vice-versa. Finally the efficiency curve for the three different seasons is plotted and according to the observed data a comparison is carried on based on different factors affecting the efficiency of the panel. The total energy output in kWh is also calculated using the power curve of the panel for three different seasonal variations.

'''Abstract''' This paper presents a novel optimal utilization of photovoltaic solar system as STATCOM for voltage regulation and power factor correction during both nighttime and daytime. The PV solar system conventionally generates real power during the day but the entire asset remains idle at night. This novel PV solar system operated as STATCOM is termed PV-STATCOM which utilizes the entire inverter capacity in the night and that remaining after real power generation during the day for accomplishing various STATCOM functionalities. Bluewater Power Corporation in Sarnia, Canada, is going to showcase this new concept of optimal utilization of PV solar system on a 10kW PV system in its network. The controller for the PV-STATCOM is being developed in the university lab and will be installed in the distribution utility network. A simulation model for the 10kW PV-STATCOM and the Bluewater Power distribution system network is developed in PSCAD software. This paper presents the steady state and transient performance of the PV-STATCOM controller for voltage regulation and power factor control both during nighttime and daytime. This proposed PV-STATCOM if connected at the terminals of an industrial customer having induction motor loads can help improve power factor and avoid potential penal tariffs over a 24-hour period, in addition to generating revenues due to sale of real power during the day.

'''Abstract''' In the design of a solar photovoltaic system, one criterion that continues to receive low priority is the provision of minimum inter row spacing for photovoltaic modules. Consumers and installers alike strive to maximize area usage for systems such that they achieve the highest amount of annual energy output. This, in turn, leads to module rows being designed very close to each other; with array tilt lowered in an attempt to reduce inter row shading. This design practice fails to take into consideration many effects that close row spacing can have on system output. When designing a photovoltaic array to optimize its performance as a power generator and its contribution to the electric grid during peak demand periods - shading concerns become a key consideration. This paper describes a process developed at Rowan University's Center for Sustainable Design to test the impact that inter row shading can have on power output and performance across the day. A test rig and protocol were created which tested module's output given various depths of shading from one row of modules upon another. The exclusion of bypass diodes in the system was also tested to view the most extreme possible cases of power loss induced by shading. The results of this experimentation showed that even very small amounts of shading upon solar photovoltaic modules can lead to significant loss in power generation. As more PV systems are installed on the utility system their availability during peak times becomes an ever increasing requirement for Smart Grid success. This paper also explores the ramifications that proper inter row spacing design guidelines could have on reinforcing some of the fundamental principles of Smart Grid.
* '''A significant loss of power will occur even if a very small amount of shading exist upon solar photovoltaic modules'''
* '''Power output of modules can be maximized by optimization of the balance between maximum module density per area and minimum module shading'''
* '''Intermittent sources have a greater potential for availability during summer peaking utility's peak demand period'''
* '''By considering the altitude and azimuth angles of the sun at the design latitude and longitude, optimal row spacing can be determined'''
* '''Bypass diodes can be used in the PV modules in order to reduce the amount of power that is wasted in the shaded area'''
* '''Applying a bypass diode to each individual cell is not practical; therefore, the bypass diode is run in parallel to a series string of cells'''
* '''Efficiency of a photovoltaic module begins to drop above a certain temperature, and efficiency losses could not be negligible if the temperature goes above 40 degrees of Celsius'''

'''Abstract''' Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has matured to become a technically viable large-scale source of sustainable energy. Understanding the rooftop PV potential is critical for utility planning, accommodating grid capacity, deploying financing schemes and formulating future adaptive energy policies. This paper demonstrates techniques to merge the capabilities of geographic information systems and object-specific image recognition to determine the available rooftop area for PV deployment in an example large-scale region in south eastern Ontario. A five-step procedure has been developed for estimating total rooftop PV potential which involves geographical division of the region; sampling using the Feature Analyst extraction software; extrapolation using roof area-population relationships; reduction for shading, other uses and orientation; and conversion to power and energy outputs. Limitations faced in terms of the capabilities of the software and determining the appropriate fraction of roof area available are discussed. Because this aspect of the analysis uses an integral approach, PV potential will not be georeferenced, but rather presented as an agglomerate value for use in regional policy making. A relationship across the region was found between total roof area and population of 70.0 m2/capita ± 6.2%. With appropriate roof tops covered with commercial solar cells, the potential PV peak power output from the region considered is 5.74 GW (157% of the region’s peak power demands) and the potential annual energy production is 6909 GWh (5% of Ontario’s total annual demand). This suggests that 30% of Ontario’s energy demand can be met with province-wide rooftop PV deployment. This new understanding of roof area distribution and potential PV outputs will guide energy policy formulation in Ontario and will inform future research in solar PV deployment and its geographical potential.

'''Abstract''' The main objective of this paper is to report and present design and implementation of a 12 kW solar-wind hybrid power station and associated wireless sensors and LabView based monitoring instrumentation systems to provide a teaching and research facility on renewable energy areas for students and faculty members in Electrical Engineering Technology (EET) programs at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI). This new ongoing project requires to purchase a 10 kW Bergey Excel-S wind turbine with a Power Sink II utility intertie module (208 V/240V AC, 60 Hz), eight BP SX175B 175W solar PhotoVoltaic (PV) panels, and related power and instrumentation/data acquisition hardware. A 100 ft long wind tower to house the new wind turbine is available at UNI campus. Furthermore, the electricity generated by this power station will be used as a renewable energy input for a smart grid based green house educational demonstration project to aid the teaching and research on smart grid and energy efficiency issues. 330:038 Introduction to Electrical Power/Machinery, 330:166 Adv Electrical Power Systems, 330:059/159 Wind Energy Applications in Iowa, 330:059/159 (2) Solar Energy Applications and Issues, and 330:186 Wind Energy Management are the classes that will use this proposed testbed. There are also workshops planned for the area Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers as well as local farmers' education and training on wind and solar power systems. Previous workshops organized by UNI Continuing and Distance Education have been very successful. The hybrid unit contains two complete generating plants, a wind-turbine system and a PV solar-cell plant. These sources are connected and synchronized in parallel to the UNI power grid as part of laboratory activities on wind-solar hybrid power systems and grid-tie interactions. The proposed project is part of a program initiative to improve our laboratory facilities to better reflect on the current and future renewab- - le energy technologies. The proposed testbed will allow students to be educated and trained in the utilization of real-time electrical power systems and additionally will allow them to gain valuable “hand-on” experience in setting up a real-time data acquisition system specifically in grid-tied wind-solar power systems. Since Iowa's solar energy resources are higher in summer, this will provide an excellent complement to the load demand when summers are not windy.

'''Abstract:''' Hawaii is experiencing a substantial increase in grid-tied PV installations and utility companies are concerned with the resulting grid management issues. To address these concerns and to enable the utilities to make informed decisions, the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) of the University of Hawaii initiated a PV test program that provides high-resolution data to characterize module and array performance under a variety of local climatic conditions. In the first phase of the project HNEI developed a PV test bed located at Pu'u Wa'a Wa'a ranch on the Kona coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. Initially we selected seven different PV technologies for testing consisting of poly-crystalline, mono-crystalline, amorphous, and mixed technologies. The test modules comprise 200 W units, tilted at 20°, with maximum power point trackers, via small inverters connected to the grid or via charge controllers connected to a battery and load bank. The data is sampled at 1 Hz and stored in a database for visualization and analysis. This paper presents a description of the test bed design, the high data rate Data Acquisition System (DAS), and initial experimental results.

'''Abstract''' Modelling of residential solar powered stand-alone power system comprising photovoltaic (PV) arrays, and a secondary battery is presented. Besides, an economic study is performed to determine the cost of electricity (COE) produced from this system so as to determine its competitiveness with the conventional sources of electricity. All of the calculations are performed using a computer code developed by using MATLABÂ®. The code is designed so that any user can easily change the data concerning the location of the system or the working parameters of any of the system's components to estimate the performance of a modified system. The system output was calculated for Cairo city (30Â°01'N, 31Â°14'E) in Egypt. It was found that maximum amount of hourly radiation on the photovoltaic arrays tilted by an angle of 30Â° facing south is 945.8 W/m2 and is obtained in April. Also, the average maximum efficiency of the modelled 200 W solar cells was 12.098% with a maximum power of 162.172 W. The system which has an efficiency of 10.283% showed a great ability to satisfy the estimated demand load. The COE obtained from the system was found to be 44 cents/kWh over 20 years of its operation. This cost is high when compared with 30 cents/kWh for electricity produced using an off grid diesel generator and 6 cents/kWh for a similar grid connected house. However, an extra cost of 1.6 cents/kWh exists in case of considering removing CO2 produced by the two conventional sources.

'''Abstract''' In this paper, a study has been made to enhance the performance of Solar Home System (SHS) by a very simple method where the investment cost is negligible. Like any other developing country of the world, most of the rural people of Bangladesh do not receive grid power due to shortage the of primary energy sources and the high cost involved for transmission & distribution system. To stimulate the economic activities among the rural population and to enhance the literacy rate, Bangladesh government has taken up a massive plan to sell SHS among the rural masses on a very soft loan. Although the per unit energy cost for PV home system is quite high, improvement in the performance of SHS will significantly reduce the per unit energy cost of the SHS. Bangladesh receives an average solar irradiation of 3.82-6.42kWh/m2 and considering the total area of Bangladesh and assuming the efficiency of solar system to be 10%, 5.2×109 kWh of electricity can be generated annually. Roughly 60% population of the country do not have access to grid electricity and are mostly dependent on bio mass to meet their energy requirement. However, solar home system is becoming popular day by day and even poor households are now becoming interested to purchase solar home system due to its various advantages. Around half a million solar home systems have already been installed in different parts of Bangladesh and the annual growth rate is around 5%. One of the major limitations of the solar home system is its extremely poor efficiency. Lot of research is going on to improve the performance of the solar panels. Sun tracking is a method frequently adopted for performance enhancement. However sun tracking devices need expensive control and drive equipments and the power for these equipments has to be provided by the solar panel and the battery installed within the solar home system. Due to cost and frequent maintenance requirement, such tracking systems are not popula- - r in Bangladesh. Even a slight enhancement of the performance of solar cells will drastically reduce the overall per unit energy cost of the solar home system. In this paper, performance enhancement of solar panel by direct reflection of light has been studied experimentally. In order to make a comparative study, readings of the output of solar panels were taken under three different conditions simultaneously. The conditions are: i) panel output when the panel was inclined at 23.5° with the horizontal ii) panel output by tracking the sun and iii) panel output by fixing plane mirrors at the East-West ends of the panel edge with the panel fixed at 23.5° with the horizontal. Encouraging results were obtained with such reflectors installed with the solar panel. Results from the practical data show that by using mirrors, an average increase of around 25% in the short-circuit currents, as high as that of sun tracking, can be achieved. And as a result of the reduced complexity and zero power consumption of the mirror system, as compared to that of sun tracking system, use of mirrors will be more economically viable over sun tracking. Moreover, installation of mirrors is cheap, simple and does not require any additional complicated equipments or devices.
* '''Three methods are used in order to improve performance of PV system, sun tracking method, diffused reflectors, mirror reflectors'''
* '''Sun tracking method increase the output power by 20%, but it consumes power for its own operation and a complicated maintenance is required'''
* '''Diffused reflectors are subjected to damage due to gusty winds'''
* '''Mirror reflectors are cheap and the current output will be higher by using these mirrors than sun tracking method, and mirrors are placed at an angle of about 120 degree with the panel's horizontal surface'''

'''Abstract''' Small size polymeric solar cells at laboratory scale have recently reached efficiencies up to 8.3% [1]. The rapid progress in manufacturing methods which allow a continuous roll-to-roll production indicate that this high efficiency could be within reach for larger modules [2]. Life cycle analysis has evaluated the environmental impact of this emerging technology and allows us to compare the carbon emissions mitigation potential of the polymeric solar technology with other photovoltaic technologies, other renewable energy sources, or fossil fuels [3]. In this work, a detailed economic calculation on the cost of electricity production by a 1kWp grid-connected organic photovoltaic system has been performed. Building on the detailed material inventory and the module manufacturing process for the production of organic photovoltaic modules [2], the economical cost of a 1kWp organic photovoltaic system has been calculated taking into account the materials, direct process, labour, balance of system components, design and maintenance costs and using a well established methodology for the economical analysis [4,5]. Assuming values for the performance ratio of the PV system, insolation level, inflation and interest rates, the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) from an organic photovoltaic system is calculated. The interest of organic photovoltaic technologies is mainly the promise of very low-cost for module components and therefore cheap solar electricity. Our calculation demonstrates that this statement is within reach for an already tested manufacturing process which allows the fabrication of organic photovoltaic modules. The cost of solar electricity is calculated to be 0.26 euro/kWh for 3% efficiency modules of 5 years lifetime, assuming a performance ratio of 0.85 and an insolation of 1700kWh/m2 per year. This reduces to 0.11 euro/kWh if cells with the module reach the current record efficiency of 8.3% and the module lifetime is extended to 10 years. A sensitivity ana- ysis has been performed and it shows the importance of improving the lifetime of the organic PV modules to around 10 years. The cost of electricity from an organic photovoltaic system could be more favourable than that obtained for an equivalent inorganic (silicon-based) system and could attain grid parity in the coming years.

'''Abstract''' With the spiraling cost of imported fossil fuels and high values of insolation, the Caribbean region hopes that photovoltaic (PV) technologies will provide a more cost effective and secure energy solution. PV performance parameters are given under Standard Test Conditions (STC). Since STC is never realised under normal operational conditions (NOC) within Jamaica's climate, it is essential that we investigate the actual performance characteristics and the most cost effective technology for Jamaica. We present the results of energy delivered by 8 commercially available PV modules under NOC and hence determine the levelised cost per kWh delivered over their average warranted lifetimes.

'''Abstract''' This work describes measurements of the solar irradiance made during cloudy periods in order to improve the amount of solar energy captured during such periods. It is well-known that 2-axis tracking, in which solar modules are pointed at the sun, improves the overall capture of solar energy by a given area of modules by 30–50% versus modules with a fixed tilt. On sunny days the direct sunshine accounts for up to 90% of the total solar energy, with the other 10% from diffuse (scattered) solar energy. However, during overcast conditions nearly all of the solar irradiance is diffuse radiation that is isotropically-distributed over the whole sky. An analysis of our data shows that during overcast conditions, tilting a solar module or sensor away from the zenith reduces the irradiance relative to a horizontal configuration, in which the sensor or module is pointed toward the zenith (horizontal module tilt), and thus receives the highest amount of this isotropically-distributed sky radiation. This observation led to an improved tracking algorithm in which a solar array would track the sun during cloud-free periods using 2-axis tracking, when the solar disk is visible, but go to a horizontal configuration when the sky becomes overcast. During cloudy periods we show that a horizontal module orientation increases the solar energy capture by nearly 50% compared to 2-axis solar tracking during the same period. Improving the harvesting of solar energy on cloudy days is important to using solar energy on a daily basis for fueling fuel-cell electric vehicles or charging extended-range electric vehicles because it improves the energy capture on the days with the lowest hydrogen generation, which in turn reduces the system size and cost.

'''Abstract''' This paper presents methodology to evaluate size and cost of PV power system components. The simplified mathematical expressions are given for sizing of PV system components. The PV array size is determined based on daily electrical load (kWh/day) and number of sunshine hours on optimally tilted surface specific to the country. Based on life cycle cost (LCC) analysis, capital cost (US$/kWP) and unit cost of electricity (US$/kWh) were determined for PV systems such as stand-alone PV (SAPV) and building integrated PV (BIPV). The mitigation of CO2 emission, carbon credit and energy payback time (EPBT) of PV system are presented in this paper. Effect of carbon credit on the economics of PV system showed reduction in unit cost of electricity by 17–19% and 21–25% for SAPV and BIPV systems, respectively. This methodology was illustrated using actual case study on 2.32 kWP PV system located in New Delhi (India).

'''Abstract''' Growth of the photovoltaic (PV) market is still constrained by high initial capital costs of PV. Developments in PV technologies may lead to cheaper systems at the likely expense of life expectancy and efficiency. Cost boundaries are required for future PV technologies to compete effectively within the current PV market. This paper develops a methodology based on life-cycle costing and sensitivity analysis to determine cost boundaries for new PV technologies. Amongst other comparisons with existing PV systems, the upper wattpeak cost bounds are estimated and the minimum economically viable replacement period is illustrated. Furthermore, future PV system ratings are compared to current PV systems for similar energy outputs. The results show that a price reduction factor greater than 5 is competitive for future solar cell lifetimes of less than 4-5 years. Meanwhile, future PV systems were, on balance, found to have higher ratings compared to current PV systems of similar energy outputs. The potential application of the model developed in this work is also discussed.

'''Abstract''' The performance of a photovoltaic (PV) array is affected by temperature, solar insolation, shading, and array configuration. Often, the PV arrays get shadowed, completely or partially, by the passing clouds, neighboring buildings and towers, trees, and utility and telephone poles. The situation is of particular interest in case of large PV installations such as those used in distributed power generation schemes. Under partially shaded conditions, the PV characteristics get more complex with multiple peaks. Yet, it is very important to understand and predict them in order to extract the maximum possible power. This paper presents a MATLAB-based modeling and simulation scheme suitable for studying the I-V and P-V characteristics of a PV array under a nonuniform insolation due to partial shading. It can also be used for developing and evaluating new maximum power point tracking techniques, especially for partially shaded conditions. The proposed models conveniently interface with the models of power electronic converters, which is a very useful feature. It can also be used as a tool to study the effects of shading patterns on PV panels having different configurations. It is observed that, for a given number of PV modules, the array configuration (how many modules in series and how many in parallel) significantly affects the maximum available power under partially shaded conditions. This is another aspect to which the developed tool can be applied. The model has been experimentally validated and the usefulness of this research is highlighted with the help of several illustrations. The MATLAB code of the developed model is freely available for download.

'''Abstract''' It is particularly important to evaluate the properties of the generation system in the actual operating conditions in order to get a real picture of the amount of electricity which could be generated. The Eastern of Mexico is a region with a significant amount of solar radiation potentially useful for PV applications. Thus, the Energy Laboratory of the University of Yucatan developed an autonomous photovoltaic generator to evaluate the operational performance of a stand-alone PV system in the local environmental conditions. The system created allows monitoring the patterns produced by the generation, storage and consumption of the electrical power to study the transport of energy along the whole system. On the other hand, the solar radiation and the temperature were also monitored because of their impacts on the PV generation pattern.

'''Abstract''' Given the high potential of PV technology to reduce the environmental impact of electricity use of products, it would be worthwhile to advance the integration of PV systems in mass produced products. We assume that industrial design engineering (IDE) could play a crucial role in making PV technology fit for product applications by its focus on functionality and usability. IDE might have an added value to existing R&D of PV technology which emphasizes on increased performance and decreased production cost of PV cells and modules. Therefore, in this paper, we will assess how industrial design methods might favour the development of product-integrated PV applications. In our project product designers have conceptually designed 17 products with integrated PV cells. The project took place in 2007 at the School of Industrial Design Engineering of University of Twente in the Netherlands. During the design process several innovative design methods were applied, among which the innovation phase model, lead user studies, platform driven product development, risk diagnosis, technology road mapping, TRIZ, innovative design and styling, innovation journey and constructive technology assessment. By observing 17 PV-powered products which resulted from the project we evaluated the innovative effect of industrial design methods on product-integrated PV applications. The application of IDMs resulted in a broad range of varied innovative PV-powered product concepts ranging from small products, like electronic handhelds, to middle-sized products like toys and portable fridges, to big-sized objects such as building-integrated PV elements and a zeppelin. The results show that the use of carefully chosen and applied industrial design methods can help to better integrate PV technology in products.

'''Abstract''' Photovoltaic (PV) generation involves the direct conversion of sunlight into electrical energy. In recent years it has proved to be a cost-effective method for generating electricity with minimum environmental impact. Due to the environmental and economic benefits PV generation is now being deployed worldwide as an embedded renewable energy source and extensive research is being performed in order to study and assess the effectiveness of PV arrays in Distributed Generation (DG) systems either as a potential energy source or as energy reserve in combination with other types of distributed energy resources. This paper presents the modeling and MATLAB simulation of a stand-alone polycrystalline PV Array system and investigates load following performance efficiency under various loading and weather conditions as well as suitability with regard to enhancing power supply reliability to critical loads. The modeling of the PV array that has been performed in this research using MATLAB Simulink is based on the calculation of parameters for the Thevenin's equivalent circuit of each cell of the array. The standard double exponential polycrystalline cell model has been adopted for this research with solar irradiance E and ambient temperature T as the input and Thevenin's voltage Vthar and Thevenin's resistance Rthar as the output.

'''Abstract''' The cost of photovoltaics (PV) is expected to decrease by a factor of two to four within the next two decades, making PV a very attractive and cost-effective solution to the problems of fossil fuel depletion and growing energy demand. Crystalline Si has been the champion of the PV industry, providing an average growth of greater than 30%/yr in the last six years, in spite of stiff competition from other materials and technologies. Si has the uncanny ability to reinvent itself when challenged. This paper describes how Si is responding to the challenge of cost- effective PV via thinner and lower-cost substrates, low-cost technology development, higher manufacturable cell efficiencies, and proven reliability and scalability. Cost and technologies roadmaps are developed that show 17-18% efficient cells on 150-200-/spl mu/m thick wafers can reduce the manufacturing cost below $1/W for a 100-500 MW production facility.

'''Abstract''' To preserve the Earth, a 100 MW very large-scale photovoltaic power generation (VLS-PV) system is estimated assuming that it is installed on the world deserts, which are Sahara, Negev, Thar, Sonora, Great Sandy and Gobi desert. These deserts are good for installing the system because of large solar irradiation and large land area. A PV array is dimensioned in detail in terms of array layout, support, foundation, wiring and so on. Then generation cost of the system is estimated based on the methodology of life-cycle cost (LCC). As a result of the estimation, the generation cost is calculated as 5.3 cent/kWh on Sahara desert, 6.4 cent/kWh on Gobi desert assuming PV module price of $1.0/W, system lifetime of 30 years and interest rate of 3%. These results suggest that VLS-PV systems are economically feasible on sufficient irradiation site even if existing PV system technologies are applied, when PV module price will decrease to a level of $1.0/W.

'''Abstract''' This paper reports the performance of a 4-kW grid-connected residential wind-photovoltaic system (WPS) with battery storage located in Lowell, MA, USA. The system was originally designed to meet a typical New-England (TNE) load demand with a loss of power supply probability (LPSP) of one day in ten years as recommended by the Utility Company. The data used in the calculation was wind speed and irradiance of Login Airport Boston (LAB) obtained from the National Climate Center in North Carolina. The present performance study is based on two-year operation. (May 1996-Apr 1998) of the WPS. Unlike conventional generation, the wind and the sunrays are available at no cost and generate electricity pollution-free. Around noontime the WPS satisfies its load and provides additional energy to the storage or to the grid. On-site energy production is undoubtedly accompanied with minimization of environmental pollution, reduction of losses in power systems transmission and distribution equipment, and supports the utility in demand side management. This paper includes discussion on system reliability, power quality, loss of supply and effects of the randomness of the wind and the solar radiation on system design.

'''Abstract''' It is now accepted that photovoltaics is the most promising of the renewable energy sources for electric power generation. Photovoltaic's ability to provide reliable, high grade energy over an extended lifetime is now well proven in both space and terrestrial applications. Widespread adoption of this clean, silent power source, however, still awaits the achievement of a number of outstanding technical and economic objectives. Extensive research into photovoltaic technology over the last two decades has done enough to conclude that all these goals can be met. The present challenge is to apply these results industrially and commercially so as to make the dream and reality. Photovoltaics can only provide an efficient service to its users if it provides a transparent and trouble free source of electricity. This involves the application of photovoltaic devices in well integrated systems which also include appropriate mechanical and electrical interfaces. The author focuses on one part of the system-the photovoltaic generator itself. This paper reviews the status of international developments and the contributions which they can make in achieving this objective.

'''Abstract''' This paper presents the results of a recent study to assess the near-term cost of power in central station applications. Three PV technologies were evaluated: Fresnel-lens high-concentration photovoltaic (HCPV);, central receiver HCPV; and flat-plate PV using thin-film copper indium diselenide (CIS) cell technology. Baseline assumptions included PV cell designs and performances projected for the 1995 timeframe, 25 and 100 MW/year cell manufacturing rates, 50 MW power plant size, and mature technology cost and performance estimates. The plant design characteristics are highlighted. Potential sites were evaluated and selected for the PV power plants and cell manufacturing plants. Conceptual designs and cost estimates were developed for the plants and their components. Plant performance was modeled and the designs were optimized to minimize levelized energy costs. Cost estimates for both plant and energy delivered include effects of uncertainty in key parameters. Although the study did not involve detailed engineering, efforts were made to optimize all of the plant designs and minimize levelized energy costs. Cell and module fabrication processes were also developed.
