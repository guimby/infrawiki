 
Electrical Resistance of a circuit element is a property of the type of material and its size (length and diameter).  The units of electrical resistance (R) is Ohms. The larger the surface area of a wire, the smaller the resistance, and the longer the the length of the wire, the greater the resistance.

The resistance of a metal also increases with an increase in temperature.
The quantities of resistance, potential difference and current are related to each other by a formula known as '''Ohm's Law''': <br>
I = V/R  or  V = IR <br>

where I is the [[current]] and V is the [[potential difference]] or [[volt]]age.<br>

Different materials have different reactivities. [[Superconductors]] have a resistivity of 0 at low temperatures.
