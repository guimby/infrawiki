The '''crank'''{{w|Crank (mechanism)}} is one of the oldest methods of converting [[human power]] to mechanical power. Since the invention of the [[electric generator]], cranks are also used for small-scale [[electricity]] generation. 

Cranks are normally hand-operated. It is important to note that operating a crank can rapidly become tiring. For many applications [[pedal power]] (which uses the larger leg muscles) may be a better option.

Hand-cranks are still often a good choice for small-scale mechanical grinders (e.g. coffee grinder), millers, rollers (e.g. pasta machine), shellers, and the like. 

Some small-scale [[water pump]]s are also hand-cranked.

The word "crank" is also used for mechanical linkages that convert reciprocating linear motion into rotary motion or vice-versa.
