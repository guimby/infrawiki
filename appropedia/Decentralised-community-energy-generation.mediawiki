This is a work in progress, an idea for now. Feel free to expand it as much as you'd like.

'''Decentralised community energy generation''' is a concept whereby the community is in control of the energy it generates and uses.

It has a focus on [[renewable energy]]. It can, and should, create local employment. It is an underpinning of local [[resilience]]. It is part of transitioning to a sustainable community, a sustainable way of living with conscious energy use.
