'''Biochar''' is a name for [[charcoal]] (pyrolized plant matter), especially in usage as soil amendment. It represents a scalable low-tech strategy for carbon sequestration in the soil.

Charcoal has many effects on soil fertility, although it is not much of a nutrient in itself. Some of the world's most productive soils (e.g. Canadian prairies, Russian [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernozem Chernozem] / or "black earth") are very rich in organic carbon. This is now thought to be pyrogenic in origin, likely originating from prairie or forest fires. This carbon is often thousands of years old, demonstrating its stability in soil.

Besides improving agricultural productivity, charcoal in the soil may serve as a long-term carbon sink, trapping elements that would otherwise contribute to greenhouse climate effects.  For more extensive background on Biochar, please consult the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochar Wikipedia entry on biochar].


=== The Biochar Economy ===
[[Image:2959038953 31a102dc5d.jpg|thumb|right|Image from Flickr user '''visionshare''' by CC license]]
Agricultural charcoal production and interment is a key cyclical ingredient in the regeneration of human habitats, with potential economic significance.

==== List of uses of biochar====
*Inexpensive soil amelioration for degraded land (i.e. biochar as a liming agent)
*Need less land = lower startup costs for a Sustainable Village 
*Increased biomass productivity 
*Efficient use of biomass waste for energy generation 
*Reduced need for fertilizer input (e.g. manure)
*Combine biochar with vermicompost to make superb fertilizer. 
*Pyrolysis gas can be used for energy and as a heat source 
*Bio-oil and tars are also by-products of pyrolysis, can be turned into biodiesel 
*Add charcoal to compost heap to speed up composting (probably works via enhanced microbial activity)
*Biochar for sale as a source of income for an emerging community

===Biochar as a method of carbon sequestration===
The [[earth]] absorbs around 18 times the amount of [[carbon]] emitted by [[humans]] each year.{{fact}}{{w|Carbon cycle}} However, about the same amount (one figure given is 99.9%) of this carbon is released to the atmosphere through [[decomposition]]. This cycle can be closed by a process known as [[pyrolysis]], in which biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen, creating charcoal and locking carbon in the form of biochar.{{w|Biochar}} 

Locking carbon away from the atmosphere and the carbon cycle described is referred to as [[carbon sequestration]]. Biochar can potentially lock away carbon carbon for hundreds or even thousands of years. If a real commitment were made, massive reductions in atmospheric carbon could be achieved - locking down carbon emissions and increasing the wealth of our soils. In conjunction with other geoengineering projects, biochar may truly hold the key to saving our earth from climate catastrophe.

Biochar is also an effective and ecologically friendly soil amendment. It may also have applications in [[energy production]]{{fact}} and as a dietary supplement for animals.

Its production was practiced by pre-Columbian Amazonian natives (''"terra preta"''), and natural processes appear to have created a similar affect in other parts of the world, creating rich soils.

Biochar is not a solution on its own, but it appears to be an important element in comprehensive solution. ''See [[Measures to stop global warming]].''

=== Biochar Technology ===
(for merged content from [[Biochar Technology]] page)

*Combine with solar thermal heat source to make a ''solar pyrolysis unit'' for charcoal production

=== Biochar Reactors ===

Several small-scale units have been devised for baking charcoal, many with simple common materials. Charcoal making ([[pyrolisis]]) dates back thousands of years in human history, traditionally practiced via earthen pits and mounds. Today, steel drums of different sizes are most commonly utilized due to portability, airflow control options, heat resistance, and availability. See articles below for some examples, and a page on [[Simple Biochar Kilns]].

==== Suitable feedstocks ====
A variety of feedstocks can be used. Since these often constitute agricultural residues in [[rural communities]], a form of waste is turned into an asset. Possible feedstocks include: 

*'''agricultural leftovers:''' straw, rice hulls, corn stalks, chicken/cattle poop
*'''Fast-growing biomass:''' bamboo, switchgrass, miscanthus, 
*'''Wood scrap/salvage:''' unused or recovered wood byproducts
*'''Other:''' leaf litter, grasses, macroalgae, bones (high P content),  

==== Terra preta ====
[[Terra preta]] is a type of very dark, fertile anthropogenic soil found in the Amazon Basin. It is basically a mixture of charcoal, bone, and manure. It is very stable and remains in the soil for thousands of years.

== Criticism ==
Critics are concerned that large scale biochar production may increase deforestation and pollution levels. However, a variety of biomass feedstocks other than wood can be used (see above). Old-growth forest is likely not a good feedstock because of extensive pre-processing that would be required. Small biomass pieces such as pellets or cherry pits make excellent feedstock. Air pollution from biochar production can be greatly reduced and eliminated through proper production system design.
