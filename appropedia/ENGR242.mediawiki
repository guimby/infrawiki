'''Why 3-D Printing?''' A recent report from data company Wanted Analytics found that in one month [https://www.wantedanalytics.com/analysis/posts/demand-for-3d-printing-skills-soars?utm_source=Google%2B&utm_medium=Google%2B&utm_campaign=9_4_2014_3DPrinting 35 percent of engineering job listings] from a variety of fields, including biomedical, software, and transportation industries, required applicants familiar with 3-D printing.[http://theinstitute.ieee.org/career-and-education/career-guidance/thirtyfive-percent-of-engineering-jobs-now-require-3d-printing-skills] Forbes explains why [http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/03/31/2015-roundup-of-3d-printing-market-forecasts-and-estimates 3D printing is such a big deal]. 



'''Why open source?''' You will make more money, because OS is more valuable. Recent analysis shows that jobs with the keywords "Microsoft Windows" have an average salary of $64,000, while jobs with the keyword "Linux" have an average salary of $99,000.

==Course Description==
This course provides an overview of open-source hardware in theory and practice for an introduction to distributed additive manufacturing using open-source 3-D printing. The course will explore the initial design and further development of open-source instrumentation as it relates to the build of a RepRap form of 3D printer. Each student will build a customized 3D printer and will learn all hardware, firmware and software for operating it. The printer will then be used in the completion of a series of projects in the students' field of interest.


==Learning Outcomes==
1.  To demonstrate a depth and breadth of knowledge about open source hardware and software, especially as it relates to 3D printing technologies ([[ENGR242#CWLO_1|CWLO 1]])

2.  To develop critical thinking & synthesis skills through labs on structural analysis, materials testing and software development ([[ENGR242#CWLO_2|CWLO 2]])

3. To develop critical thinking skills through the trouble shooting process involved in hardware development ([[ENGR242#CWLO_2|CWLO 2]])

4.  To demonstrate effective communication skills in developing well documented software code and appropriate posting of open source projects ([[ENGR242#CWLO_3|CWLO 3]]) ([[ENGR242#GESL_LO_1 |GESL 1]])

5.  Practice scientific skills such as data sampling, measuring, and analysis to determine the effect of various design configurations on print quality and resolution  ([[ENGR242#GESL_LO_2b|CWLO LO 2b]])

6. Explore the trade-offs between print speed and resolution as each of these is intentionally controlled in software ([[ENGR242#GESL_LO_2b|CWLO LO 2b]])

===Required Course Material===
[[image:OSL.jpg|thumb|left]] '''There is a $100 lab fee for this course.''' This fee will be used to purchase expendable materials for you to build your printer during the course. You must provide your own SD Card for storing your print files. You should plan on $25 or more additionally to purchase your choice of filament to use with your printer. You also have the option of buying a set of hardware components totaling about $500 at the bookstore to use for your build. If you use your own components, then at the end of the course you keep the printer you built in the course. The printer will be similar to the image above, but the design is constantly evolving.

Textbook: J.M. Pearce, ''The Open-Source Lab'' (Elsevier,2014). Other reading will be handouts in class, on-line reading, and emailed pdfs. See hyperlinks in schedule.

===Course Organization===
This course will be run as a lab course with lectures. Students will be expected to read the course material before class and actively participate in discussions. The majority of class time will be spent on labs and projects. Each student will be responsible for building a RepRap Jellybox 3-D printer to use to complete the projects. Students will be responsible for giving short presentations on their projects on each sub-topic in front of the class at the end of the semester.




===Grading Policy===

<font>Grades will be based on the following:</font>
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
| <font></font>RepRap build
| <font>100</font>
|-
| <font>Quizzes</font>

|-
| <font>'''Total Points'''</font>
| <font>'''1000'''</font>
|}

===Late Assignments===
Deduct 10% per day, up to 5 working days, then 0 grade. Only exception is for '''excused''' absences. (Being on the IN list is '''NOT''' adequate for excused absence. Missed projects will result in a zero for the assigned work. Quizzes on the readings cannot be made up, ever.

===Course Policies===
Appropriate behavior, attendance, participation and collaboration with your peers on group assignments is expected. All assignments are to be completed by the beginning of class on the due date '''even if you are IN''', unless you make other arrangements with me at least '''24 hours''' in advance. 
Collaboration/Plagiarism Rules
Students are strongly encouraged to learn while helping fellow students learn. Collaboration is encouraged on the group project but individual projects and exams must be completed alone.
===Academic Integrity===
A Principian is expected to pursue a life of integrity (see the Principia Pledge and the Principia Community Commitment.) Therefore academic honesty is essential to a Principia College education.  Academic regulations and procedures are governed by University policy (see Principia College Catalog 2016-2017).  Any act of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the class.
