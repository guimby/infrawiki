The '''second law of thermodynamics ''' states:

'''for any spontaneous process, the ''entropy'' of an isolated system can only increase or stay the same, but never decrease.'''<br>

The ''entropy'' is a property of the system that measures the disorder in a system. For example when you add a drop of black ink into a glass of water, the ink disperses making the water grey and cloudy- the system is now more disordered. Likewise, when heat is added to a system, disorder or entropy increases; but when heat flows out of the system, entropy decreases.<br>

In this second law, heat can not flow from a cold object to a hot one, but allows it to flow the other way around, from the hot to the cold object. It implies that in an isolated system, energy will disperse over a certain period of time, leaving less [[energy]] available to do useful work.
<br>

There are 2 important statements that follow this law: 
<br>

 1. Heat can flow spontaneously only from a hot source to a cold sink. 
 2. No [[heat engine]] can be constructed in which [[heat]] from a hot source is converted entirely to work. Some heat has to be discharged to a sink at a lower temperature. 


The second statement brings us to the fact that 100% efficiency in a system is impossible- which is where  [[Carnot efficiency]] comes in.
