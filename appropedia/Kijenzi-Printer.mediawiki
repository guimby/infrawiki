The '''Kijenzi printer''' is a modified version of the [[Athena]] RepRap printer that is designed for usage in rural/rugged areas. "Kijenzi" loosely translates to "little maker" in Swahili, and this page details the design and development as the Kijenzi printer as it is prepared for usage in western Kenya.

This printer line is being designed with help from students, faculty, and staff from Michigan Technological University and users in Kisumu, Kenya. This Kisumu user group represents a small group of technical professionals who are responsible for the maintenance and repair of both medical and non-medical equipment in the the county's many health facilities.

The Kijenzi printer will be developed iteratively, with new features constantly being added in between field trials in East Africa. Some of the desired features,their reasons for inclusion, and their current development status can be seen below.
