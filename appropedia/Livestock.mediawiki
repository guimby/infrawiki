== Environmental impact of livestock ==

Livestock have a large negative impact on the environment, through greenhouse gases, nitrogen pollution, deforestation, and ammonia, which contributes to acid rain.[2]

Livestock, when used for meat, also use far more resources than the same amount of nutrients in vegetable form (e.g. grains or legumes).

See '''[[Environmental impact of livestock]]''' for more detail.

== Animal welfare ==

Factory farming, with its emphasis on production and efficiency through the accumulation of many small gains, causes many [[animal welfare]] problems.

Traditional farming may not have been concerned with the happiness of animals, but in its more natural setting, the animal was likely to have a more varied experience and room to move. Certified [[organic farming]] follows something closer to this model, and certification generally includes animal welfare criteria.{{fact}}
