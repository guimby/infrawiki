==How==
A kitchen-unit is made from sticks and sheet metal. It has a sink facility at table height; behind it there is a gas cooker where three pots can be heated. There is water storage for clean and used water below the sink, and a facility for laundering. Above the sink and around the smoke duct there is storage for things to be kept dry, like kitchenware and food. The kitchen unit can be rolled away, to free the cement floor for bathing.
