Worldwide, grid-based electric lighting consumes 19% of total global electricity production.<ref name="iea2006">http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/Light2006SUM.pdf</ref>  The energy used to provide the world's light is 1 900 Mt of CO2 per year.<ref name="iea2006"/>  In Africa 60% the energy for lighting and other needs is derived from wood, leading to deforestation.<ref>http://www.uneca.org/mdgs/goal7.asp</ref>  Combustion-based lighting is also a major cause of respiratory illness,<ref>http://blumcenter.berkeley.edu/led-lighting-replacement-project</ref> and generally of poor quality for reading, contributing to illiteracy.<ref>http://www.dhan.org/electricity/</ref>  All in all, plenty of reason to seek ways of providing more sustainable lighting everywhere.  Certainly electric lighting will be a key part (in addition to [[Natural lighting]]).

*[[Incandescent light bulbs]]{{w|Incandescent_light_bulb}} are dubbed as "energy-inefficient" and are being phased out in many parts of the world, including the European Union and Australia. (However, they are still more energy efficient than [[fuel-based lighting]].) In addition, regular incandescent bulbs contain no environmentally-polluting components, unlike fluorescent lights (including CFLs) and halogen incandescent lights.{{fact}}). The excess energy that is not used by the lamp is emitted as heat and can thus still prove useful at times for extra heating.

* [[Fluorescent lights]]{{w|Fluorescent lights}} with [[Electrical ballast#Electronic 'ballasts']]{{w|Electrical ballast#Electronic 'ballasts'}} are slightly more efficient than older fluorescent lights and give a more pleasant light.They come in 2 types: compact fluorescent (CF) lights and regular (long) fluorescent lamps. [[CFL]]s or [[compact fluorescent lights]]{{w|compact fluorescent lights}} have the advantage that they can be used in regular light fittings. Most CFLs now come with an electronic ballast <ref>http://www.electronics-project-design.com/ElectronicBallastDesign.html</ref> Fluorescent lights are much cheaper than LED lamps, and only slightly less efficient.

* [[LED]] lighting is becoming increasingly attractive. It is used in remote regions such as Nepal, by the [http://lutw.org Light Up the World Foundation]. These lights are far sturdier than other types of lighting, especially compared to fluorescent lights.

* [[LEC]] lighting{{w|Light-emitting electrochemical cell}} is an economically more attractive alternative to [[LED]]s.{{fact}} They are made using a roll-to-roll printing process which explains their much lower cost. They are however as energy efficient as LED's. The only downside they have is a starting time of about 2 seconds.

* [[LVD]] or [[Electromagnetic induction bulbs]] or the [[Electrodeless lamp]]{{w|Electrodeless lamp}} These relatively new lamps offer dimmable, longer life and half the Watts per lumens than CFLs. <ref>http://lvdbulbs.com/lvd_faqs.htm </ref> More information is needed on their performance {{fact}}

==Suggested projects==
* Compare light quality of different lights. What is the flicker rate of CFL? Are there better quality ones, comparable to the high quality but expensive tri-phoshpor fluorescent lights with electronic ballasts?{{sp}} 
* Start a section on tri-phosphor lighting in the relevant Wikipedia and/or Appropedia article.){{sp}} 
* Compare the life expectancy of different types of lights - find peer-reviewed studies, if possible. What factors affect life expectancy?{{sp}} (CFLs sometime don't last as long as expected in my experience, though I've been told by an efficient lighting expert that Phillips and Osram are more reliable than other brands. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] &middot; <small>[[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]</small> 19:19, 1 May 2007 (PDT))
