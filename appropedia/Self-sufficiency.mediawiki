{{topic header| default.png | Self-sufficiency}}Â 

'''[[Self-sufficiency]]''' is about having the [[skills]], [[resources]] and [[planning]] needed to get by with what we have locally.{{expand}} It is one aspect of [[resilience]].

== How self-suffient are you? ==

A simple metric may be to ask: How often do you visit WalMart/SAMS/LIDL ?

*Once per day - not self-sufficient at all - you need help.
*Once per week - not exactly self-sufficient.
*Once per month - better, or maybe you just have a larger freezer.
*Once per year - now you're getting there.
*Once - definitely self-sufficient.

== How far? ==

Make the tools to make the tools to make the things you need.  

This can be taken to a bit of an extreme.  Do you knap the flint, to dig the ore, to smelt the metal, to forge the plow, to grow the corn, to make the mash, to distill the drink  ?  At some point, a non-self-sufficient person provided the tools to allow you to live a self-sufficient life-style.

Many of the principles of self sufficiency are used in other movements such as homesteading, survivalism, simple living (or voluntary simplicity) , hobby farming, smallholding and off-grid living. All utilise some aspects of living solely on what you can produce yourself from your own piece of land. Since this is almost impossible to do entirely many choose to produce more than they need in food and other goods, which they can then barter with for other goods and services. 

Like all things, taken to an extreme self-sufficiency is unhealthy. We also need to take advantage of [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#I|interdependence]], which offers much [[efficiency]], [[resilience]] and variety in our lives, when planned [[appropriate]]ly.

== A place for specialization? ==

{{text box|A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects. - Robert A. Heinlein|right}}

The opposite of self-sufficiency is [[specialization]] and [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#I|interdependence]], often in the form of trade. 

Specialization is the basis for much of human progress, and provides (for example) the tools mentioned above. Historically, when small communities of only a few thousand people became isolated, they actually lost skills as there weren't enough people to carry on the traditions of all the specializations. The Tasmanian Aborigines{{w|Tasmanian Aborigines}} are an example of this, after they were cut off from the Australian mainland.

Through the [[economic]] principle of [[comparative advantage]],{{w|Comparative advantage}} specialization allows net benefit from trade - provided trade is not suddenly disrupted.

== Balance ==

While self-sufficiency in terms of skills aids resilience, and providing for oneself maintains those skills, it is also true that many benefits come from specialization. 

A wise path is to receive the benefits of specialization, but plan for the [[contingency]] that self-sufficiency may be needed one day, without warning.
