Scythe are curved knives for cutting vegetation. 

==Advantages==
* no noise pollution (or any kind of pollution)
* produces hay for use as animal feed/bedding, mulch, eco-construction, insulation
* only need to scythe a field or yard 2-5 times per year

==Bottom Line for Scythe success==
* adjust the snath to fit your body type (same as for a bicycle)
* find your "groove" (a repetitive trance-like wide movement that feels effortless like being in the zone when jogging) [http://www.scytheconnection.com/adp/trance.html poem]   [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugSO54WKm8I video]
* keep the blade sharp ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RtQZrCqh4&feature=related peening]) and [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlvMxYbwxiw&feature=related honing])
* the grass is significantly easier to cut around sunrise and sunset
