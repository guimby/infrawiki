== Materials needed to make a smooth formed bottle ==
Light weight PET Bottle
 

== Tools to make a smooth formed bottle ==

== How to make a smooth formed bottle ==



=== Unfolding the bottles === 

# Take the labels off the bottles. <br>
# Put boiling water in the PET bottles.
# Tighten the screw cap on the PET bottles.
# Put the PET bottles in a pan, and heat up so the water in the PET bottles will steam.
# After a few seconds the heat and the steam will unfold the bottom of the PET bottles.<br>
The bottle gets proximately 10% smaller

WARNING - Only steam the PET bottle for a few seconds, otherwise the screwcap will pop off and the bottle will fold together rendering it useless

Cool down the PET bottles until there is no pressure inside.



===Unfolding the bottle with pump===

# Make valve in cap. <br>
# Put boiling water in the PET bottle.
