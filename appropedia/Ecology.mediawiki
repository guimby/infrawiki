'''Ecology''' is the scientific study of the relations that living organisms have in respect to each other and in respect to their natural environment. It includes the [[Biodiversity|species composition, distribution, amount (biomass), and number of organisms within and among ecosystems]]. 

'''Ecologism''' (sometimes called "environmentalism") is the broad philosophy and social movement regarding concerns for the conservation of the original environment and the rehabilitation of the state of the original environment, as well as the living organisms therein.<ref>[http://press.georgetown.edu/book/georgetown/ecologism Ecologism definition]</ref>
