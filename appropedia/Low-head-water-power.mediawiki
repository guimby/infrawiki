Almost all water power sources with under 1 meter fall in the world are unused. That a lot of power! [[Pulser pump]]s can use use that power directly for pumping water. Pulser pumps can also provide low pressure air. That in turn can easily be used to wash clothes and dry them. Pulser pumps could also be used to run a wide variety of low powered machines. Pulser pumps are extremely low tech, and low cost - but are they effective?{{fact}} If designed properly, pulser pumps could probably capture a lot of silt clay and sand from rivers too.{{fact}} A medium tech use for low head hydro is a [[ram pump]] which is for pumping water. Ram pumps are probably more for smaller (by volume)  power sources, are more expensive  but give higher efficiencies.
