==Instructions==
First you select projects to follow up on with a partner and reserved them here. Then, for each of the projects you selected, you will add a new section near the bottom of the selected project pages with the heading ''==Update October 2013==''. There you will add words, images, data, and/or video based upon your findings. You will need to completely read and understand the projects before you visit the projects. You will then need to visit (or call for non-local) the projects, take (or ask for if non-local) pictures and/or videos, assess the projects, and briefly interview at least one stakeholder about the project (to assess how well it is still working and what has changed). 

Once you are done adding all of your updates to the project pages you selected, you will need to paste the URLs of your pages onto the Moodle assignment with a brief synopsis of what you added.

Later you will be presenting your findings to the class in an 8 minute presentation (powerpoint, prezi or video).
