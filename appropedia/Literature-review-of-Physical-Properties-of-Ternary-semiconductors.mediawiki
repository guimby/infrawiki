Abstract:
AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary semiconductor is very important as an x of a constituent in the semiconductor is going to have significant changes in calculating Physical Property like Band Energy Gap. These Ternary Compounds can be derived from binary compounds by replacing one half of the atoms in one sub lattice by lower valence atoms, the other half by higher valence atoms and maintaining average number of valence electrons per atom. The subscript X refers to the alloy content or concentration of the material, which describes proportion of the material added and replaced by alloy material. This paper represents the AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary Semiconductor Band Energy Gap values

Keywords: Band Energy Gap, Composition, Electro Negativity, Molecular weight, density, optical polarizability.

Introduction:
1)	In this opening talk of AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary Semiconductor Band Energy Gap Electronegativity values of Ternary Semiconductors are denoted by symbols XM and XN and Band Energy Gap is denoted by Eg
2)	Linus Pauling first proposed Electro Negativity in 1932 as a development of valence bond theory,[2] it has been shown to correlate with a number of other chemical properties.
3)	The continuous variation of physical properties like Electro Negativity of ternary compounds with relative concentration of constituents is of utmost utility in development of solid-state technology.
4)	In the present work, the solid solutions belonging to AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary Semiconductor Band Energy Gap have been investigated. In order to have better understanding of performance of these solid solutions for any particular application, it becomes quite necessary to work on the physical properties like Electro Negativity of these materials.
5)	Recently no other class of material of semiconductors has attracted so much scientific and commercial attention like the III-V Ternary compounds.
6)	Doping of Al component in a Binary semiconductor like GaSb and changing the composition of do pant has actually resulted in lowering of Band Energy Gap.
7)	Thus effect of do pant increases the conductivity and decreases the Band Energy Gap and finds extensive applications
8)	The present investigation relates Band Energy Gap and Electro Negativity with variation of composition for AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary Semiconductor.
9)	The fair agreement between calculated and reported values of Band Energy Gaps of AlSb and GaSb Binary semiconductors give further extension of Band Energy Gaps for Ternary semiconductors.
10)	The present work opens new line of approach to Band Energy Gap studies in AlxGa1-xSb III-V Ternary Semiconductor
