=Introduction=
Fuel cells are emerging as an attractive power supply source for applications such as distributed generation power systems<br>and electrical vehicles. Hybrid fuel cell technology can be applied to various fields: electricity power plants, automotive manufacturing, <br>cogeneration, smartphone, construction and etc. Hybrid fuel cells has the following advantages: cleanness, high efficiency and high <br>reliability. Fuel cells operate without the efficiency limitation of the Carnot cycle and without the pollution associated withe the combustion <br>of fossil fuels<ref>A. Dalvi and M. Guay. 2009. Control and Real-time Optimization of an Automotive Hybrid Fuel Cell Power System. Control EngineeringPractice17(2009)924â€“938.</ref>. However, there are also disadvantages: it cannot store energy, the response is slow, difficult to cold start <br>and its output voltage fluctuates with the load<ref>Jin, K et al. 2009. A Hybrid Fuel Cell Power System. IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics. VOL.56, NO.4.</ref>.

=Types Fuel Cells=
*'''Hydrogen Fuel Cell'''
Electricity, water and heat can be produced when hydrogen and oxygen combined as a fuel cell. If compared to batteries <br>which has limited lifespan, the fuel cell will produce electricity as long as the fuel (hydrogen) is supplied, and nver losing its charge <ref>Hydrogen Energy. http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/tech/hydrogen</ref>. 
*'''Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM)'''
Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells employ a polymer membrane with acid side groups to conduct protons from the <br>anode to cathode. Water management in the fuel cell is critical for PEM fuel cell operation. Sufficient water must be absorbed into <br>the membrane to ionize the acid groups; excess water can flood the cathode of the fuel cell diminishing fuel cell performance <br>limiting the power output. <ref>http://www.princeton.edu/~benziger/PEMFC.pdf</ref>
