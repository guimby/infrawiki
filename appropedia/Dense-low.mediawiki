The [[Denmark|Danish]] '''dense-low tradition''' of housing is one of no [[high rise]] [[apartments]] but rather houses of two and three stories, clustered around shared courtyards and open space. There is little emphasis on separated single-family homes.

With a [[population density]] of around 35 people per [[Glossary_of_sustainability_terms#H|hectare]] this is lower than the development in most European cities, but much more compact than [[Auto City]] suburbs which are approximately 10 people per hectare.

== Questions ==

* What are the cultural factors that led to this kind of development, as opposed to [[suburban sprawl]] or high rise?
