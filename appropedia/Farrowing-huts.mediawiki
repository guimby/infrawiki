A '''farrowing hut''' is a shelter for [[swine]] (pigs) when giving birth.

It serves to keep the cold and wind out, and provide a relatively clean and protected place for the birth and for the young piglets. 

== Design factors ==

It should not be too heavy to move if needed - e.g. if a [[tractor]] is used on the farm, it should not be soo heavy that the tractor cannot pull it. 

It should be strong enough that the floor is not damaged by the swine's weight, and if it leans against the wall, the wall should not break.
