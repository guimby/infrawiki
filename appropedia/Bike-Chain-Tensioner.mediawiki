== Bill of Materials==
# [https://github.com/SpoonlessCorey/OSAT_BikeChainTensioner Tensioner.scad]
# (2) ZipTies
# (1) 8-32 Thread, 1-1/4" Length Machine Screw (eg. [http://www.mcmaster.com/#91792a201/=uvhjkl McMasterCarr:91792A201])
# (1) 8-32 Thread Locknut (eg. [http://www.mcmaster.com/#91831a009/=uvhlvw McMasterCarr:91831a009])

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Screwdriver
# Adjustable Wrench or Pliers

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Ability to use a 3d printer.
* Ability to use a wrench and screwdriver.

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
All parts are symetric such that component orientation is not an issue.

Assembly:
# Ziptie the cage to the Bicycle frame just above chain.
# Hold the chain up so it is captured in the cage.
# Bolt the pully in place
# gently crank the pedals by hand and shift throug all gears to ensure nothing is binding

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* If the fit to they bicycle is loose or overly tight the OpenScad variable "pipeDia" can be set to match your bike frame's tubing diameter.

== Cost savings==
* Approximatly $23.50 (78.3%)
** 30g of PLA at approx. $30/kg = $0.90
** Machine Screw, Locknut, and bag of zip ties approx $5.60 at local hardware store
** Equivalent Chain Tesnsioner: [http://www.amazon.com/Bionicon-7640162290111-c-guide-eco/dp/B00HZRCZBS Bionicon C.GUIDE] approx. $30
** 30 - (5.60 + 0.90) = $23.50
