In the United States, tanker wagons that empty septic tanks and cesspools are known as 'Honey Wagons'. A hose is attached to the tanker and the wagon sucks the sewage out of the tank and into the tanker. The waste is then transported to a Sewage Treatment Works for further processing.

All wastewater removal services are required to have a relevant waste licence.
