==Abstract==
<center>''[[Engr215 Friends of the Dunes]] is non-profit organization that needed several projects done, one of them being an interactive display for the Living Green trail located in front of [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ Humboldt Coastal Nature Center](HCNC). The objective of the project was to design and build an interactive display that engages and educates the visitors about living in an environmentally conscious way, "living green".  The Living Green Interactive Display is the results of this project.  The display allows visitors to engage in the display through its interactive components and educates the visitors about the green technologies used at HCNC.  ''</center>

== Background ==
[[Friends of the Dunes]] [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/] in Manila recently finished major renovations to the former Stamp’s house, transforming the building into a Green Building Council.  Many visitors are unaware of the green technologies used in [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ HCNC]. The executive director of Friends of the Dunes, client Carol Vander Meer[http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/about/staff/] wanted a display for visitors to learn about the green technologies used at HCNC and to encourage them to develop a green lifestyle.    

=== Specifications ===
The specifications are the requirements from the client criteria and must be implemented throughout the designing of the project.  The following specifications will be adhered to during the design process:
* Location: Humboldt Coastal Nature Center, Manila, California, United States of America
* The exhibit is interactive.
* The exhibit is adaptable for future changes.
* The exhibit is low maintenance.

=== Considerations ===
Considerations while building the exhibit are:
* People of all ages will be using the display.
* People will be using the display upon arrival or departure.
* The location will be visited by mainly English and Spanish speakers.
* The display will be outside for three months during the summer.

== Client Criteria ==
The criteria are a list of standards in which the final project will be judged upon.  The list was formulated by the group and the client and is defined by it constraints which are the measurable properties of the criteria.

[[Image:Warmnbright_supplylayout.JPG‎|thumb|right|Most of the supplies used to create the exhibit.]]

The exhibit is built almost exclusively using environmentally conscious materials. The four distinguishable parts of the exhibit are the base, interactive elements, and the display. The base is constructed of driftwood which was collected near [[Friends of the Dunes]]. The driftwood is heat treated, sanded and stained.  The bottom of the base is cemented to a 5 gallon BPA free bucket and buried 2 feet deep in the ground.  The top of the drift wood that connects to the display is cut to a 30 degree angle so the display has a lower profile. 

The display which contains the informational content is the shape of a half circle, imitating the shape of the [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ Humboldt Coastal Nature Center]. The outer edge green to represent the green roof of the HCNC and the inside of the display is an aesthetically pleasing sandy yellow color. Written in the display is a brief overview about the new friends of the dunes building as well as the LEED certification standard for green buildings. The display teaches visitors about two main components of the green technologies used to gain [http://www.usgbc.org/ LEED] certification. 

The sign has three main areas of focus insulation, [[Daylighting]], and radiant floor heating. Two types of environmentally friendly insulation are described and presented on the display for visitors to interact with. The soy based foam insulation, used in the HCNC, as well as the denim insulation are able to be touched by visitors.  The next area, Daylighting, is another interactive element that connects to Daylighting application at the HCNC. Mock windows are located near the center of the display. The windows have shutters with hinges, and underneath is information about Daylighting advantages and Daylighting at the HCNC.  The last area, radiant floor heating, has a a wooden flap that can be opened up.  Under the flap is information about radiant floor heating at HCNC along with a picture of the system. On top of these three areas there is a game called the “Green Living Challenge” located at the bottom of the sign, which challenges visitors to find all the Living Green logos around the HCNC in order to win a prize. The display has a section dedicated to recommending sources to learn more about the Friends of the Dunes, green technologies and environmentally friendly building supplies.

== Costs ==
The Cost of the Exhibit is separated into three sections: The cost in hours it takes to build, the cost in dollars for materials, and the cost to maintain the exhibit. 

=== Material Cost ===
These are the costs of materials used in the construction of Green Living Warm and Bright interactive exhibit. The total amount spent to construct the project was $248.73. Because the wood from the project was acquired for below market value. The total projected costs for Looney Dunes is $283.73.

=== Design Cost ===
The design costs indicate the amount of hours that Looney Dunes put into this design project. A total of 316 hours were spent on this design project. The majority of the design hours were spent in phase 5. The figure below represents the amount of time in required for each phase of the design process from the initial definition of the problem to the finished solution.

===Maintenance ===
The Exhibit requires minimal maintenance. Once every week the display of the exhibit should be wiped down with a damp cloth. Every two months hinges need to be cleaned and the denim insulation needs to be replaced by new denim insulation. A year’s worth of denim insulation pieces are supplied for replacements. After a year, insulation will need to be obtained from The Alternative Building Center[http://www.abcgreenbuilding.com/] in Humboldt California. The foam insulation will need to be replaced every three months or when needed. A year’s worth of replacement foam pieces is supplied. After a year, foam insulation will need to be obtained from the original source.

== Discussion ==
The resulting Living Green Warm and Bright exhibit is an effective way to educate visitors about the HCNC, Green Technologies, and Living Green. The interpretive sign is easy to read and attracts people with its unique look. Younger Kids enjoy playing with the mock windows and touching the insulation. People can read about the Humboldt Coastal Nature center as well as living green. The display is very sturdy because the buried cement bucket makes a solid base.  All stationary pieces on the display are tightly bonded to the display. The hinges are oriented so that they cannot be over extended and break.  The exhibit fits each the criteria exceptionally. The natural stain colors of the base as well as the sandy color of the display make the exhibit visually tasteful. The display is simple and educates visitors about Humboldt Coastal Nature Center and living green via interaction and information. The interpretive sign’s height is adjustable, and its low profile allows for it to be interacted with from a wheel chair. From the driftwood base to the information in the display, the Green Living Warm and Bright interactive exhibit represents the Humboldt Coastal Nature center and provides a brief overview about living green for visitors. 

=== Next Steps ===
The two areas of improvement for the exhibit is to increase durability of the sign and interactivity within the sign.  The sign is built to last for one summer outside, so improvements can be made to make this sign more permanent. The other area of improvement for this display is interactivity. Adding different methods of interactions can increase the level of engagement in the sign.
