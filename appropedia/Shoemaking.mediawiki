==Overview==
Globalization has made it easy for people in the developed world to ignore supply chains and sweatshop practices when it comes to shoes, among many other products. However, a shoe is still a significantly larger item to throw in the landfill when worn than a toothbrush. One way to slow down or prevent industries from exploiting workers or polluting is to make conscious purchases and stop contributing to irresponsible corporate practices.

The purpose of this web page is to compile information about the social justice and environmental impacts associated with shoe manufacturing in order to make it easier to make more informed shoe purchases. Several companies make a conscious effort to monitor a responsible supply chain, reduce waste, save energy, or reduce consumption of natural resources and production of harsh toxins. Here we are attempting to compile the available options and links to further information.

Also, in order to make this information useful for people in the developing world aswell, we should include several types of shoes. For example, minimalist shoes fit better in regions where little (and sometimes) no footwear is worn. In such regions, people tend to prefer footwear which they are more accustomed to, yet perhaps offer better foot protection than what they normally wear.

In other regions (ie non-arid regions), where thorny vegetation, swamps and/or dangerous insects prevail, more durable footwear may be preferred (ie regular shoes, army boots, ...)  

==Materials==
Knowledge of materials used in shoe production can be a useful tool when making decisions about shoe purchase.

Common materials used to make shoes include:
*rubber
*plastics
*leather, composition leather and fur skin
*textiles - including felt and nonwovens
*plaiting materials
*wood
*cork
