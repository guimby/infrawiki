== What is Bicing? ==


[http://www.bicing.com/ Bicing] is an alternative public transportation in the city of Barcelona that first appeared in March of 2007 with 200 bicycles to rent and 14 stations spread around the city.  As of May 2009 there are currently 6,000 bikes and 401 stations in Barcelona.<ref>Bicing.com 2009. Web. 22 Feb 2010.http://www.bicing.com/modulos/modulos.php?TU5fSU5GT1JNQUNJT05fRVZPTFVDSU9O&NA%3D%3D&MTA%3D</ref>
The purpose of the system is to cover the short everyday journeys that are made within a city via bicycle, reducing the city's carbon footprint. An annual membership is required. Most stations are located near entrances of public transportation like the metro, public car parks and train stations. The idea is to use the bikes to easily maneuver around the city without having to rely on cars, buses or taxis. Bicing's yearly budget runs around $13 million. Bicing is financed through member's dues, parking fees, and through their sponsor Clear Channel.<ref>Chandler, Elizabeth. "Bicing: Barcelona's Communal Bicycle Program Has Transformed The City."
