'''Disease''' is a physical abnormality that causes problems and would then be classified as a pathology. [[Medicine]] attempts to cure disease.

==Types of diseases==
A list of the most important diseases can be found at http://wikitravel.org/en/Tropical_diseases
Seemingly trivial diseases can be deadly - [[diarrhea]] kills millions every year, mainly children.

==Hosts of the most important diseases==
Diseases may be spread by [[animals]] (e.g. [[Mosquito-borne diseases]], schistosomiasis (a helminth worm carried by snails), ...) or by microorganisms (which are called [[pathogens]] when they spread disease), especially through poor [[hygiene]], and poor [[sanitation]] (see [[water-borne diseases]]. 

==Improving the health of local people==
Poor [[nutrition]] and unhealthy living conditions (often due to poverty) increase susceptibility to disease. This applies to both environmental diseases such as [[respiratory illnesses]], and those caused by pathogens, which can more successfully attack when a person's immune system is weak). 

Cures can be simple. The lack of [[hygiene education]] is a factor that can easily be adressed.
