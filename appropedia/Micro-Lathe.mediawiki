==Abstract==
# This OSAT is a Micro Lathe. It uses an open source three jaw, self centering chuck, which can be found [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:624625 here]. The frame, while in Beta, is nearly parametric in order to scale to the supplies the end user has on hand, and can be altered to meet their needs.
# Current OpenScad files can be found [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1183592 here]. Warning, this project is still in beta, and as such, printing those scad files without modification will not result in a perfectly functional tool.
# A complete frame (Version 1) can be seen to the right [[Image:MicroLathe.jpg|400px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==

This rough BOM is only relevant for the beta version of this project. It will be updated regularly to reflect the increasingly refined project.

# 2 x 1/2 inch rods, length of your choosing
# 2 x 3/8 inch rods, 250mm each
# 2 x bearings, size of your choosing
# 8 x 6-32 socket bolts (1 inch)
# 8 x 6-32 square nuts
# 1 x 3 foot section of 1/4-20 rod (This will act as a drive/worm gear for the cross slide. Higher TPI means better fine adjustment)
# 1 x 3/8 bolt, fine thread.
# 1 x 3/8 square nut
# 1 bolt to fit the bearings with 80mm between the headstock parts.
