==Farming Techniques==
[[Image: RedwoodRootsFarm 006.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Crops]]
The focus of Redwood Roots Farm is to produce sustainable, local, organic food available to the public at a reasonable price. This focus means many of the techniques are environmentally conscious and sustainable, this means producing it's own fertilizer.<ref name= Seattletilth.org >'' http://seattletilth.org/learn/resources-1/city-chickens/compostingchickenmanure Seattletilth.org”., N.p., n.d. Fall 2005. Web. 18 Nov. 2013.</ref>  There are two types of compost piles that are used as fertilizer at the farm; a vegetation compost pile and a chicken manure pile. The chicken manure is a good soil amendment; it injects organic matter and creates a sponge effect collecting moisture and biota in the soil.<ref name= Seattletilth.org /> This mixture also provides plants with nitrogen phosphorus and potassium rich soil, even more so than horse cow or steer manure.<ref name= Seattletilth.org /> The traditional vegetable compost pile is also used to fertilize plants around the farm. 
Many of areas of the farm are not being grown on in order to let the land rest and regenerate nutrients to produce the best yield. This will also extend the longevity of the farm because it keeps the land useable for centuries. 
In Humboldt the weather is cold making it hard to grow some crops, Redwood Roots farm uses green houses to combat the cold. Some of the most recent crops harvested from the expansive greenhouses were the cherry tomatoes and roman tomatoes.

==Farm Stand==
One of the marketing techniques used by the farm is the farm stand. The farm stand started in 2010, it is held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, in 2012 it expanded to include Saturdays as well.<ref name=FarmStand> http://redwoodrootsfarm.com/farm-stand.php Farm Stand”., N.p., n.d.

The farm stand is located on the farm property and offers U-pick options for flowers and berries.<ref name=FarmStand /> The farm stand also brings attention to the farm bringing in more potential shareholders.
