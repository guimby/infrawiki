==Abstract==
# Many people in 3rd World countries do not have access to stores like Walmart or Target where they can purchase necessary items. One of the items nessecary for most of cooking is a measuring cup. The openscad project is set to print a 1 cup measuring cup, but can be easily scaled to any practical size for cooking.

== Bill of Materials==
OpenCAD 
*[[file:measuringCup1.scad|Open Scad File]]
STL 
*[[file:1cup.stl|One Cup]]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* How to print structural items with a 3D printer
* Use of Acetone for smoothing and crack filling

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
===Prepping for the Print===
# Use the Variable "cups" to change the size of the cup (Ex .5 for a half cup or 2 for 2 cups
# Use the Variable "lines" to change the number of size indicators up to a max of 8.
#Export STL 
#In your slicer, use a high infill and thick outer layer

===Other Info===
# Print time is ~2 Hours
# No Post Printing assembly required 

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Make sure initial layers do not curl up. If they do, it is almost impossible to use this for accurate measurements.

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# 1 Cup uses 40g of Plastic which costed me $0.80
# A good 1 cup measuring cup costs about $9.00 on Amazon
# This is a savings of $8.20 or 1125%
