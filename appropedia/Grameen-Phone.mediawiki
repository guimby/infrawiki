==Why It's Useful==

The [http://www.grameenphone.com/index.php?id=62 Grameen phone] is an opportunity for developing countries to communicate via Global System for Mobile communications ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM GSM]). The phones are most popular in Bangladesh where the concept was conceived and are used just like a mobile phone. The man behind the idea is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iqbal_Quadir Iqbal Quadir], who felt that the Grameen phone could work not only to communicate but also to provide jobs.

To be useful any GSM phone requires a network to communicate with.  Emergence of the [[OpenBTS]] software [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBTS] brought it within reach for extremely cheap devices to support connections to GSM nodes.
