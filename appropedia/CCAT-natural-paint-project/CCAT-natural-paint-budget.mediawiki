Proposal: We are requesting approximately $883.17 to paint the new CCAT building (the Buck House) with homemade all natural paints.

Project Description: Testing various natural paints for texture, durability, and color. Developing paint design and implementing it in the CCAT house.

(*) We are unsure what type of paint that we are going to use for each room, so we treated each recipe as though we are going to use just that type of paint for the entire house. The final total is a range of the three recipes. The final price does include the testing materials and two coats.

If CCAT is unable to fund your project, what other sources of funding have you explored? We hope to get as many supplies donated as possible.
