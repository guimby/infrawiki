** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153585/
***The purpose of this article was to compare the use of Self Adjustable glasses and conventional methods for refraction in young people. They did this through a studty of 648 children in the age range of 12-18 in rural southern China. According to the results of the study,self refraction could  reduce the number of trained professionals, expensive equipment and cycloplegia (paralysis of near focusing ability) in children.
*** 10% of children require refractive correction.
***Myopia is the most common error among school children
***The Liquid in the lenses has a refractive index of 1.579
***the Glasses have a manufacturing cost of $19.00
