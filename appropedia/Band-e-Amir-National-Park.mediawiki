Located near the Bamiyan Valley in central Afghanistan, Band-E-Amir, which means “Commander’s Dam” in Persian, contains “ibex (a species of wild goat) and urial (a type of wild sheep) along with wolves, foxes, smaller mammals and fish, and various bird species including the Afghan snow finch, which is believed to be the only bird found exclusively in Afghanistan” according to surveys conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society.<ref name="WCS">http://www.wcs.org/new-and-noteworthy/new-park-for-afghanistan.aspx</ref> The names of the six constituent lakes are as follows: Band-e Gholaman, Band-e Qambar, Band-e Haibat, Band-e Panir, Band-e Pudina, and Band-e Zulfiqar.<ref>http://www.afghanmagazine.com/2004_08/photoessay/band-e-amir/01.shtml</ref> 

The United States Agency for International Development provided much of the $1 million funding for the establishment of Band-e-Amir.<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/travel/2009/09/10/2009-09-10_afghanistan_has_its_first_nationa_park_bandeamir__but_not_everyone_is_thrilled.html</ref> USAID, a government agency that provides foreign aid, created the park in hopes that it will contribute to the growth of the tourism industry in Bamiyan Province.<ref="USAID"></ref> This will in turn create jobs for local residents and reduce their dependence on subsistence farming, according to USAID.<ref name="USAID"></ref> 

The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, the National Environmental Protection Agency, and the Band-e-Amir Protected Area Committee collectively manage the new park.<ref="USAID"></ref> “At its core, Band-e-Amir is an Afghan initiative supported by the international community. It is a park created for Afghans, by Afghans, for the new Afghanistan,” states Dr. Steven E. Sanderson, President and CEO of WCS.<ref name="WCS"></ref> To date Band-e-Amir remains Afghanistan’s only national park.
