=== Trees, woodland and forest ===

Atlanta has a reputation as the "city in a forest" due to its abundance of trees, unique among major cities. The city's main street is named after a tree, and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The nickname is factually accurate, as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all major American cities, and above the national average of 27%. <ref>[[wikipedia:Atlanta tree canopy]]</ref>
