=History=

[[File:COMIFAC map.jpg‎|thumb|left| COMIFAC Countries.]]

The Central African Forests Commission was founded in 1999, as a result of the Yaounde Declaration, which recognizes and protects sustainable Congo basin ecosystems. [http://pfbc-cbfp.org/comifac_en2.html] The organization is a United Nations and International Organization that is mainly located in Yaounde, Cameroon.

In 2005 the organization adopted a Convergence plan to improve the preservation and management of the Central African Forests. [http://whc.unesco.org/en/COMIFAC] The Convergence Plan is detailed below.

=Convergence Plan=

With help from [http://whc.unesco.org/en/COMIFAC CAWHFI] the convergence plan was organized to strengthen the Congo Basin's preservation.

The Convergence Plan is founded on ten goals:

Harmonization of fiscal and forestry regulation
-Resources knowledge
-Ecosystems management
-Biodiversity preservation
-Sustainable valorization of forest resources
-Development of activities in order to reduce poverty
-Strengthening capabilities and participation through information and education
-Research-development
-Financing tools development
-Regional cooperation and partnerships [http://whc.unesco.org/en/COMIFAC]

[[File:Redd-alert.jpg|frame|Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation]]

[http://www.redd-services.info/content/comifac-study REDD] Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation has worked with Central African Forest Commission to extensively study carbon stock in the different ecosystems in the Congo Basin to promote it's sustainability. 

The study was practiced as follows: 

-Phase 1-Analysis of the existing data and GAP Analysis 

-Phase 2-Determination of basic elements for a regional approach of carbon stock measurement and monitoring in the Congo Basin forests on the background of the IPCC guidelines.

Some expected outcomes of the research: 

Review on C measurement initiatives in the Congo Basin: Assessment of the methodological C measurement and monitoring experiences, including a compared technology analysis and identifying 
the possible collaborations, complementarities and synergies between the different initiatives.

Allometric Equation : Proposition of a detailed methodology for defining allometric equations 
adopted to the sub-region (including budget and capacity building plan)

Earth Observation Data: Guidance and recommendations on how to ease the access for the Congo Basin 
countries to the images of the reception satellite to be installed in Libreville.

MRV systems: Potential key technical and organizational issues for development that the 
GEF-COMIFAC programme can implement in order that the programme provides a framework and 
coordinating position for regional REDD MRV programmes (cf. scientific partnership to be set up).
