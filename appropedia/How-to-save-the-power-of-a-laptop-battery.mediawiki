'''Extending the life of their laptop battery''' is a major concern of laptop users. Here are some tips to extend laptop battery life.

* Reduce screen brightness.
* When not using the wireless receiver device, turn it off. There is often a hardware switch - just be sure to remember later when you need to turn it on again. Alternatively, turn it off via the network manager.
* Avoid use at high or low temperature. For example, when at the beach parked in the sun, do not leave your laptop in the car.
* In your power manager, set a sleep time for the display and hard disk, and set a system standby time. 
* Use built-in power management on your portable device.
* Turn off [[LCD]] or other unnecessary accessories when not in use.
* Set screen saver as blank, turning on after 1 to 2 minutes.
* Close unused programs. 
* Remove unused PC Cards or USB devices.
* Don't short-circuit battery pack terminals or store your [[battery]] pack with metal parts.
* Don't drop or mutilate the battery pack.
* It is normal for batteries to get warm during charging or normal use. If they get too hot, you may be running too many programs, or there may be a problem with the device and qualified personnel should check it.
