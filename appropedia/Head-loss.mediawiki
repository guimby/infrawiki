'''Head Loss{{w|Head Loss}}''' is the amount of energy lost in a water conveyance system due to roughness of the walls of that conveyance system. An example would be the loss of pressure at the end of a pipe due to sediment buildup or corrosion. Another would be the brush weeds and grass growing along a water channel slowing the overall flow in that channel.
