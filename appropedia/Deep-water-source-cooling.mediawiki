'''Deep water source cooling''' (DWCS) or '''deep water air cooling''' is a form of [[air cooling]] for process and comfort space cooling which uses a renewable, large body of naturally cold water as a [[heat sink]]. It uses water at a constant 277 to 283 [[kelvin]]s (4 to 10 degrees Celsius) or less which it withdraws from deep areas within lakes, oceans, aquifers and rivers and is pumped through the primary side of a heat exchanger. On the secondary side of the heat exchanger, cooled water is produced. <ref>[http://www.energy.rochester.edu/idea/cooling/1995/dwsc/ Deep water source cooling description]</ref>

==Advantages==

Deep water source cooling has several advantages:

* It is very energy efficient, requiring only 1/10th of the average energy required by conventional cooler systems. <ref>[http://www.energy.rochester.edu/idea/cooling/1995/dwsc/ Deep water source cooling using one-tenth of conventional cooling systems]</ref>
* It does not use any ozone depleting refrigerant. This is still an important feature, despite the fact that smaller/less expensive [[Refrigerator#Types of domestic refrigerators|ecologic cooling devices]] also exist.

==Disadvantages==

Several disadvantages are also present:

* It requires the presence of a (fairly) large and deep water quantity in the surroundings. To obtain water in the 3 to 6 °C (37 to 43 °F) range, a depth of {{convert|66|m|ft|sp=us}} is required. <ref>[http://www.energy.rochester.edu/idea/cooling/1995/dwsc/concept.htm Depth of lake DWSC]</ref>

* The set-up of a system is expensive and labor-intensive. The system also requires a great amount of source material for its construction and placement. For example, the pipes alone can range several hundreds of meters or feet when placed end to end.
