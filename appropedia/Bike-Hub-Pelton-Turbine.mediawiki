==Abstract==
Turbines are a much more efficient way to harvest the energy of water in a stream or river than a paddle wheel.  A Pelton wheel takes the kinetic energy and harvests it in two ways.  It uses the static pressure to push the blades and then uses the added force due to the tangential acceleration of the water around the curve of the blade to harness more power out of the jet.  This design is tough to make by hand, but is a lot more efficient than a water wheel.  Therefore, using a 3D printer to enable affordable use of this technology in developing nations.
'''Note: Water source must have high head for turbine to function well.  If there is not high head, a water wheel may work better.'''[[image:Pelton wheel iso.png|500px|right]]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Philips head Screwdriver

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* For the design of this turbine I referenced [http://www.slideshare.net/ukasha1/pelton-turbine-1 this].

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Print the base (Time:~1 Hour 45 Minutes)
# Print the blades Time:~30 Minutes each)
# Attach the turbine blades to the base using 1/4-20 bolts and nuts.
# Attach the base to the hub using the wood screws, sending them through where the spokes normally go.

== Cost savings==



* For an 11 Blade Wheel, Cost, 40% infill=$10.04
* Plastic Pelton Wheel, non replaceable Blades, Cost= $150  [http://www.microhydropower.com/price-list/]
* Savings: $139.96, or 93.31%
