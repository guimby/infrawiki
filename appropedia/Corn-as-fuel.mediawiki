John Pendray, a graduate student in MIT's [http://tppserver.mit.edu/ Technology and Policy] program, has studied the economics of burning [[corn]] rather than using energy to convert it to [[ethanol]]... so that the ethanol will ultimately get internally combusted. 

"The fuel itself is less expensive than (home heating) oil," he said. "But it is more expensive to buy a corn or ([[wood]])-pellet burning furnace."

Corn is cheaper than oil for the same amount of energy, and if corn is expensive one year, many corn-burning furnaces also burn wood-pellets, made made from sawdust and other scraps, which are slightly more expensive than corn's usual price. 

Pendray says the corn/pellet stove emits 75% less CO2 than an equivalent oil-fueled furnace. However, converting that corn to ethanol ends up producing about as much CO2 as the gasoline it would replace.

==Suggested projects==
*Design a stove which meets regulatory requirements in the relevant setting (e.g. a setting where corn is readily available, such as the USA). It must burn corn or wood pellets cleanly and efficiently, at much lower capital cost than the $3500-$4000 described in Wired blog, above. This may be inspired by the low cost [[improved stoves]] intended for less developed communities.{{sp}}
