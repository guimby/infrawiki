An '''air cooler''' is any device for cooling the air inside a building, room, or vehicle. <ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_701704124/air_cooler.html Air cooler definition]</ref>. Air coolers are used in thermally insulated casings to form [[refrigerator]]s and are also used in buildings to cool rooms. In buildings they are only required when the building itself is not constructed so that it is able to dissipate enough heat. Methods to construct buildings in such a fashion that additional air coolers are not required are eg [[Earth sheltering]] or specific building designs <ref>[http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/12/10/building-modelled-on-termites-eastgate-centre-in-zimbabwe/eastgate-centre-biomimetic-architecture-biomimicry-biomimetic-design-biomimicry-of-termite-mounds-green-building-with-termites-eco-building-sustainable-design-harare-zimbabwe-africa-sustain-4/ Eatgate Center heat dissipating building design]</ref>. 

==Devices==
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|An absorption air cooler.]]  
Several devices exist, these include:
* [[Evaporative cooler|Wet air cooler]]s
* [[Dry air cooler]]s
* [[Absorption air cooler]]s
* [[Deep water source cooling system]]
* [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger]]
* Air and water-coupled [[heat pump]]s

Coolers outfitted with extras as heating,and dehumidifying are called [[Air conditioner]]s.
