The greatest impacts for [[sustainable living]] by the human population of Earth may not be the individual actions, but rather the collective actions, such as:
* [[Carbon tax]] or [[carbon trading]]
* [[Public transport]], [[cycling]] and [[walking]] infrastructure that allows members of the society to travel sustainably without sacrificing quality of life - indeed enhancing it, while also saving money. 
* [[Urban planning]] regulations that encourage, rather than discourage, sustainability, allowing higher [[population density|densities]], encouraging alternatives such as [[cohousing]] and abandoning old principles such as setback, and the requirement
* Elimination of tariffs on [[renewable energy]] products (such as solar water heaters).
