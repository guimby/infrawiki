A '''Oxyhydrogen booster''' is a device that produces small amounts of [[oxyhydrogen]] for mixing with another fuel prior to burning it in a [[internal combustion engine]]. They are popularly used to decrease costs/km in terms of fuel expenses in vehicles. 

==Workings==
Oxyhydrogen boosters derive power from the battery (batteries being present in most IC engines, as they need electricity for vehicle lights, sparks (for igniting the fuel in non-magneto-based IC engines), ...). As the combustion occurs a lot more violently and more heat is generated than what was needed to make the gas, the fuel efficiency of the vehicle goes up.
