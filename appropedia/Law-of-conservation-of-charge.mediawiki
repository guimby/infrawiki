'''Law of conservation of Charge''' - The net electrical [[charge]] of an isolated or overall system does not change.

* Charge is conserved
* Overall charge remains unchanged
* Charge may be created or destroyed
** Must have positive/negative pairs 

== Formula ==
''The following information was extracted from Wikipedia''

                                             Q(t2) = Q(t1) - Qin - Qout

* Q = quantity of charge
* t = time
 
== Characteristics of Charges ==

* May have: positive ''( + )'' or negative charge ''( - )''
* Proton - ( + ) positive charge
* Electron - ( - ) negative charge
* Like repels like ''( + , + ) or ( - , - )''
* Opposite charges attract  ''( + , - )''
* Charge can be transferred from one object to another
