=Non-Toxic Household Cleaners=
<small>by: Kendra Cecil</small>

The household products we use on a daily basis often contain harmful chemicals and carcinogens. However, strong chemicals are unnecessary when there are many alternatives that can be made from common ingredients. You can make simple home remedies by creating the following recipes for non-toxic cleaners. After some experience, it will be easy to develop your own recipes, or make amendments to the ones below. Have fun, and feel free to experiment!

|-
| Air Freshener
| Boil cinnamon and cloves and let steam. Add 1/2c borax in bottom of garbage pails. Display bowls of potpourri, or use essential oil diffusers. Place bowls of vinegar or baking soda around to absorb odor in smelly regions.
|-

|-
|Antiseptic Herbs
|When making homemade cleaners, herbs can be added for sent and many are also natural antiseptics. Try lavender, tea tree, pine, myrrh, sage, peppermint, rosemary, eucalyptus, wormwood, thyme, or clove. You can add a few drops of essential oil, or make a strong tea of one or more of the herbs by steeping them in hot water, and adding to homemade liquid cleaners.
|-
|Tub and Tile Cleaners
|Use baking soda with a little vegetable oil based soap. Scrub with lemon slices dipped in borax or baking soda (let it sit overnight on really tough stains). To make a scouring powder, mix 1c baking soda and 1/4c borax, sprinkle on and scrub.
|-
|Bleach

|-
|Drain Openers
