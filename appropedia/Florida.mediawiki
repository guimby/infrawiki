=== Environment quality ===

[http://www.floridadep.org/ Florida Department of Environmental Protection] - [http://www.protectingourwater.org/ Florida Rivers and Watersheds – Florida DEP] - Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Restoration of the Everglades|Restoration of the Everglades]]: Restoration of the Everglades has long been recognized as an environmental priority in the state. In 2000, Congress passed the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, a $7.8 billion, 30-year project aimed at preservation and restoration of the region and its unique combination of environments. <ref>[[wikipedia:Environment of Florida]]</ref> Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.

=== Reduce, reuse, repair and recycle ===

The recycling rate in Florida is estimated at 28% in 2000. In 2008, The Energy, Climate Change, and Economic Security Act of 2008 set a goal of progressively improving recycling to reach a 75 percent rate by the year 2020.

It directs public entities (schools, state and local public agencies) to report the amount they recycle annually to their counties. Private businesses are encouraged (but not mandated) to report the amount they recycle to their counties. Finally, the section directs DEP to create the Recycling Business Assistance Center. Under the new law, each county must implement a recyclable materials recycling program that shall have a goal of recycling recyclable solid waste by 40 percent by December 31, 2012, 50 percent by 2014, 60 percent by 2016, 70 percent by 2018, and 75 percent by 2020. The county with the highest recycling rate is Lee County with a 43% recycling rate as of 2008. <ref>[[wikipedia:Florida#Recycling]]</ref>
