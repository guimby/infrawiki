Below is a living collection of technologies that can be (or are being) implemented at various Occupy camps and other temporary, autonomous camps. This is just a start, please add to it by clicking edit or discuss the page on the {{talk page}}.

==Energy generation==
===Human power===
Using a bike, you can generate around 150W of continuous power. E.g.:
* [[Rowan's portable pedal power generator]] Nice portable unit that fits most bikes.
* Here are two built for New York City's Waterpod: [[WaterPod Tour de Volts]] and [[WaterPod Bicycle Energy Generator]]
* Here are two pedal powered TVs that would work well for laptops and other devices: [[CCAT pedal powered TV]] and [[Samoa Hostel Pain in the Axle]]
* Here are a whole bunch of pedal powered innovations from CCAT: [[CCAT pedal powered innovations]]
* For a different take, this rowing machine blender could be made to generate electricity with a generator: [[Locally Delicious rowing machine blender for schools]] (note the detailed instructions at [[Rowing Machine Blender Instructions]]
* Here is a mechanical bike blender using a flexishaft: [[Public Health Bike Blender]]

===Solar and wind===

A 100W photovoltaic panel can cost under $100 will produce 100W for a certain number of hours a day depending on the amount of full sun as found at http://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html. [[Solar photovoltaic software]] lists software that can help with design and [[Photovoltaics#Sizing a PV System]] covers some of the basics. Example systems include:
* [[Photovoltaic vaccine refrigeration at Centro De Salud]]
* [[La Yuca small scale renewable energy]] 10W solar and 10W wind for lighting an urban schoolroom.
* Here are a couple of photovoltaic learning stations, one of which is already being used in an Occupy camp: [[Engr 305 solar learning station]] and [[UTC photovoltaic learning station]]
* [[Samoa Hostel Windbelt]] Very low power from low winds and fairly low tech.

===Cooking and dehydrating===
* [[Parabolic solar collectors]]: [[Papasan Chair Solar Cooker|Papasan chair cooker]], [[Aleiha's parabolic solar cooker|Satellite dish]] and [[Parabolic basket and tin can solar cooker|Blackberry bramble, bike inner-tube and tin can lids]]
* Rocket stoves: [[WaterPod Rocket Stove]] and [[CCAT rocket stove]]
* [[Wood gasification stove]]
* Retained heat cookers: [[Fireless cookers]] (to cook, food does not need to have heat energy poured into it, it only needs to be kept at a certain temperature)
* Solar dehydration: [[Locally Delicious solar dehydrator for kids with adult supervision|Simple solar dehydrator]], [[Chris's ENGR305 Solar Food Dehydrator]] and [[AEF food dehydrator]]

===Cooling and refrigeration===
* [[Burning Man Evaporative Cooler]]
* [[Zeer pot refrigeration (design)]]

===Used cooking oil and fats combined heat and power systems (CHP)===
* [[Pure plant oil combined heat and power]]
* [[Used cooking oils and fats as diesel engine fuel]]

==Water==
[[File:Day 21 Occupy Wall Street October 6 2011 Shankbone 32.JPG|thumb|An effective greywater treatment system used at Occupy Wall Street to water Zuccotti Park's plants, October 2011<ref>[http://www.decodedscience.com/sanitation-issues-faced-by-occupy-wall-street-protesters/4005 Sanitation Issues Faced By Occupy Wall Street Protesters], Janelle Vaesa, Decoded Science, October 15, 2011</ref>]]

===Supply===

Water may be plentiful in the city when it's raining (especially if you can access the outlet of a drainpipe) but will be affected by pollutants, and needs to be properly filtered before use for drinking cooking. Wait for the water to run for a while first (at least 15 min, depending how heavy the rain is - longer is better) - this lets the water wash away pollutants from the air and the roof, leaving you with much cleaner water. 

* See [[Rainwater]] e.g. the design at [[La Yuca rainwater catchment]] but smaller with 55 gal drums. You can use the calculator at http://www.pequals.com/rain to figure out how big your system can/should be.
 
===Purification===
* [[Water purification]]

===Wastewater treatment===
*Greywater treatment, e.g. [[Samoa Hostel Truth Tank]] and [[Occidental greywater]]

==Human waste==
* [[Composting toilet]]. If that's not practical at your local Occupy protest, here are some links for [[portable composting toilets]] 

==Shelter==
* [[Hexayurt]] - more comfortable than a tent, but still flat-pack and goes up with a few hours work.
* http://blog.burningman.com/2011/04/environment/diy-your-burn-shelter-shade-cool-cool-comfort/

==Other structures==
* [[Demo Camp Units]] - 
* [[Weld wood]] using waste metal to join wood.

==Information technology==
*[[Openstreetmap]]
* If you're rescuing computers from the languishing at the bottom of your cupboard, Linux gives new life to old computers. Check out [[Information and Communication Technologies for Development]] and [[Low cost computer guide]].
