==Abstract==
Due to a continual rise in human population and an uncertain environmental future, the concept of housing and available resources must be rethought. The [http://www.flockhouse.org/ Flock House], founded by [http://www.marymattingly.com/ Mary Mattingly], addresses this in a sustainable and artistic manner. As a part of [[Engr215|Engineering 215 - Introduction to Design]] at [http://www.humboldt.edu Humboldt State University], Team Apple Skins is working with the Flock House to design a comprehensive skin which will complement the structure of the Flock House in a functional and meaningful way.

==Background==
[[File:FHMeasurements1.jpg |thumb|left|Flock House Dimensions]]The Flock House is a group of sustainable, mobile, living systems that each house two resident artists. These living systems are designed to educate and inspire people with the dynamic ecological relationships between the Flock House system and New York City. Traveling through the five boroughs of New York City during the summer of 2012, the Flock House hopes to inspire other groups across the country to begin their own interpretations and construction of similar projects.
The [http://www.flockhouse.org/html/schedule.html schedule] for the date and location of the traveling of these units falls within the time frame of May 1st through August 15th of 2012.

== Problem Analysis and Criteria ==
The Flock House needs a durable and waterproof skin that is sustainably made.

The objective of Team Apple Skins is to design a comprehensive skin which will complement the structure of the Flock House in order to protect the occupants from inclement weather. The skin will be attached to the preexisting Flock House frame of re-purposed fiberglass. The skin will be made from re-purposed materials that are waterproof and durable. It will be designed such that it may be reproduced via written instructions by the client for their purpose and vision. The skin is also designed to be aesthetically appealing to the public in order to inspire interest and fit with the overall look of the Flock House.

==Description of Final Project==
The final solution, Poly Pod, is constructed from re-purposed rain gear, umbrellas, plastic grocery bags, and bubble wrap. The solution consists of windows, awnings, planters, a door, and a canopy. Complete instructions for each component are listed in the [[# How to Build|How to Build]] Section. The windows are made by ironing bubble wrap between nine clear plastic produce bags. This process creates a flexible yet sturdy panel which can be riveted or screwed into a window frame. Two different awning styles are made using umbrellas, one is retractable and the other is removable. Planters are made by ironing standard grocery bags  together and then rolling the resultant panel into a cone while it is still warm and flexible. The door and canopy are also constructed with panels made of grocery bags ironed together. These panels are cut to shape and riveted together.

=== Maintenance Cost ===
Maintenance cost is measured in hours over a 6-month time frame. It will be necessary to repair awnings and panels which will account for 10 hours apiece. Weatherstripping seams and joints will take 3 hours. Total maintenance cost is calculated to be 23 hours in a 6-month time frame.

==Testing Results==
To transport the Poly Pod from Humboldt State University to its storage site, Team Apple Skins secured it to the roof of a car. This was done to take advantage of an opportunity to test for how well the Poly Pod would hold up in a windy environment. It held up well with no tearing or deformation at speeds of up to 25mph.
To test for how well the Poly Pod would keep occupants dry in a rainstorm, Team Apple Skins conducted a water experiment. For this experiment, one team member was inside the unit while another used a sprinkler attachment to mimic rainfall. The three different settings utilized were: mist; cone; and shower. The team member in the unit observed that the Poly Pod leaked in the areas where there was no waterproofing seal between the solution and the frame, which was anticipated. Other leaking occurred at the door frame and at the joint of Awning Style B, where it meets the window. One more panel to the door canopy would resolve the leaking at the hinge. Weatherproofing sealant would resolve the leaking at the window.

==How to Build==
Instructions for how to build a Poly Pod are here: [[Poly Pod Instructions]]

[http://etsylabs.blogspot.com/2007/05/long-overdue-fusing-plastic-bag.html Tutorials] for ironing together shopping bags can be found online.

==Discussion and next steps==
Team Apple Skins initially became interested in the possibility of re-purposing plastic bags as a potential solution due to an in-class handout of a material from a previous ENGR 215 team. This team was [[FBP Hot Dang Plastic Encasement]]. The Poly Pod solution process will be submitted to the client for review. The solution will be implemented on the Flock House project for the Summer 2012 launching.
