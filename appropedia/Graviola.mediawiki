This tree is low and is called graviola in Brazil, guanabana in Spanish and has the uninspiring name "soursop" in English. The fruit is very large, and the subacid sweet white pulp is eaten out of hand or, more commonly, used to make fruit drinks, sherbets and such.

The principal interest in this plant is due to its strong anti-cancer properties. Although it is effective for a number of medical conditions, its anti-tumor effect draws the greatest attention. This plant is a proven remedy for cancers of many types {{fact}}.

Graviola is used as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for both bacterial and fungal infections, is effective against internal parasites and worms, lowers high blood pressure and is used for depression, stress and nervous disorders.
