== Clearance ==
An additional ten feet of clearance has been cleared around the main garden perimeter which now gives a total clearance of 45 ft. The perimeter is built upon a 5% grade and gives more space for [[solar energy]] to impact garden photosynthesis processes.<br>

== Plots ==
To prevent [[soil erosion]] for the 4 ponds that are external to the [[community garden]] there are numerous logs bolted to heavy boulders so that ponds can maintain integrity.As far as produce, two new farming plots have been designed external to the community garden. One plot allows for growth for pumpkins and sun flower seeds which are seasonally grown and harvested during later summer early fall. The other plot was designed for spices and is uniquely engineered to attract pollinators which are generated by [[horticulture]] surrounding the garden.<br>
