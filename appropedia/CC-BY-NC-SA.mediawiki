The '''Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike''' license, or '''CC-BY-NC-SA''' for short, is a popular license for content on the web.

Content under this license is '''not compatible with Appropedia''':
* Appropedia content may not be reused under this license.
* Content under this license cannot be used on Appropedia.

This is due to the "Non-Commercial" clause. See [[Non-commercial licenses vs open licenses]] for an explanation of why Appropedia does not use this content, why it is not generally considered a true [[open license]], and why the Appropedia Foundation (along with many in the [[open content]] community) discourages the use of the non-commercial clause.
