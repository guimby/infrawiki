Traveling throughout Ghana, in several regions I noticed rainwater catchment systems set up, as a common way for a household, hotel or other structure to receive and have water.

These systems shown here are pretty standard and are similar to the other systems I saw around. One is from a small hostel and the other from a women's pottery coop and studio. They all consist of a gutter/tubing that funnels the water into a holding tank.
