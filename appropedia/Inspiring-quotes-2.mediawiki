:"The future is knocking at our door right now. Make no mistake, the next generation will ask us one of two questions. Either they will ask: "What were you thinking; why didn't you act?" Or they will ask instead: "How did you find the moral courage to rise and successfully resolve a crisis that so many said was impossible to solve?" We have everything we need to get started...

:"Today's world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity."


:"We humans are social beings. We come into the world as the result of others’ actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others’ activities. For this reason it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others." 


:"I think that it is generally true that members of certain traditional, rural communities, do enjoy a greater harmony and tranquillity than those settles on our modern cities. My impression is that those living in the materially developed countires, for all their industry, are in some ways less satisfied, are less happy, and to some extent suffer more than those living in the least developed countires. Indeed, if we compare the rich with the poor, it often seems that those with less are often less anxious. As for the rich......they are so caught up with the idea of acquiring more than that they make no room for anything else in their lives. As a result, they are constantly plagued by mental and emotional suffering - even though outwardly they may appear to be leading entirely successful and comfortable lives."

:"There are some 2 billion people, many living sustainably with traditional livelihoods, who are unlikely to ever have access to banks or dominant money systems. Yet, their mutual aid and barter can be facilitated independently from our dysfunctional money systems, which are about scarcity, competition and fear. Barter and mutual aid are about cooperation, sharing and abundance." 


:"Unpaid work (parenting, growing [[food]] for family and community needs, maintaining households, volunteering in community service, do-it-yourself home and community construction, and repair projects) is estimated as some 50 % of all production in OECD countries and 60 to 65 percent in developing countries."

"... What of the relationships built, the degree to which people feel more hopeful, skilled, connected, positive, resilient?  What are the gardens actually growing? What are the community energy companies actually generating?  What are the construction projects actually building?

And these are just a fraction of the wider, diverse, and innovative networks of grassroots responses happening around the world. " Rob Hopkins  <ref>Why COP21 matters, and why I'm going. Rob Hopkins.

:"A defining difference between Empire and Community, Suicide Economy and Living Economy is the shift from hierarchy to [[Networks|networking]] as organizing principle." 


:"The seeds of living economies have already been planted and are taking root in countless communities throughout the world. Some have been around for a long time. They include land trusts, local organic farms and farmer's markets, enterprises producing and marketing innovative environmental services and products, community supported agriculture initiatives, local restaurants specializing in locally grown organic produce, community banks, local currencies, buy local campaigns, fair traded coffee, worker buyouts of factories whose owners are moving production abroad, family businesses that take pride in community service, employee and community owned businesses, production networks of small producers taking on large projects, recycling business, independent book stores that serve as community learning centers, independent media, community sustainability indicators, green business directories, independent business alliances and much more."


:"To the forces of community, the world is inherently nurturing, compassionate, and overflowing with creative abundance and opportunity. In the world of community we consider violence and conflict to be irrational, because they are self-destructive — a violation against the sacred spiritual unity that is the source of life and the ground of all being. Meaning and purpose are found in equitably sharing power and resources to secure the well-being of all as we engage in a cooperative exploration of life’s infinite creative possibilities."

"You, my sisters, perhaps it is your husband who earns the money for your family, but it is you who are determining how that money is spent; and in so doing you are deciding the fate of your village. You may choose to buy the beautiful silk made in [[France]] or [[Belgium]], or you may choose the khadi cloth made by your sister and your neighbor. When you choose the khadi cloth, you are investing in more than cloth, you are investing in your neighbor, her children, and your village. As you watch the children walking to school in the morning, fed by the earnings of their mother, you realize that you and they are woven together through the cloth. You and your village are richer in proportion to the number of such stories that unite you." J. C. Kumarappa

'''of course permaculture''' <br> "if we all did our bit then we could all live in peace with nature alittle more. <br>nature is what has brought us here and supported us. to start your own forest garden for example is very simple. simplicity is a major part of [[permaculture]]. everything has multifunctions, cooperating with each activity. for example the garden gives you [[food]], gives animals food, trees clean the air and may create windbreaks, the food you eat will be discarded and then turned into compost. I could go on and on. life supporting life. not major food chains, insecticides, or monoculture. what a healthy harmonious life it is too. coming from an [[ecovillage]] in [[argentina]] gives me inspiration to start my own one day. until then i will do my part, remembering that everything i do affects the generations ahead of me. community and family gardening, composting, or just being in nature are examples of awesome ideas for anyone if you are interested.. there is alot to learn from nature and permaculture, books are good but so is being surrounded by the wonderfulness of a green ecosystem. go outside!! chau from [[brazil]]" <br>lydia <ref>[http://thunderbay.indymedia.org/news/2003/01/3151_comment.php#3176 link to thunderbay.indymedia article]</ref>

"Almost everyone wants to make something of their lives, to promote their own well-being and that of others around them.
