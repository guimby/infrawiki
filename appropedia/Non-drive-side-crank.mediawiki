== Abstract ==
#The project is a part of the bike, offered by Dr. John Gershenson.
#It is designed based on a real drive-side model since I only find drive-side model from the lab.
#I choose to design the non-drive side part since the strength of the gear can not be reached by using plastic material to print.
#All size are matched with the original one.

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
* [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
*Basic knowledge for 3D printing

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Print from the base
# There is a curve that printed in the air, it's the most difficult part
# It can be printed but with low quality, needs to be corrected and polished 
# Estimated printing time: 37min
# Estimated processing time: 15 min

== Common Problems and Solutions ==
# It is made of plastic so it may not be as strong as metal.
# The edge of the crank is not perfectly smooth 

== Cost savings==

# Estimated costs: less than $2 per crank (including the cost of the filament and electricity)
# Commercial equivalent: more than $10
# Save at least $8/80% of the cost
