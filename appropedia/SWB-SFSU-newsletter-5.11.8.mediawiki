===Bay Bridge Tour===
EWB and ASCE are collaborating on a tour of the Bay Bridge on Thursday, May 15 at 2:00 pm. If you are interested in attending, reply or leave a note on the discussion page.

===Morrito Nicaragua===
Unfortunately, due to events beyond our control, the Bolivia project tanked.  That's fine though because we have a new project in Nicaragua.  Yesterday (5-10-8) Kristine, Mark B and David went to Davis to meet with a woman from Morrito and her husband. The meeting went well, so we are going.  The time frame is still Aug 1 through 25, the plane ticket will cost about $800 and the in country costs will be about $500.  We have 4 seats available and are currently looking for a translator.
See [[Morrito Nicaragua]] for more details.

===Social Night===
<s>We will be continuing meetings through the summer in preparation for our trip to Nicaragua, so we will be having an EWB social night on Friday the 16th of May at 6pm at the linked Nicaraguan restaurant.
