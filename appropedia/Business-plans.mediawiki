== A Sketch for a General Open Source Fab Lab ==
===The Sell Stuff to Get Stuff Plan===
I want to produce a Fab Lab to make 'almost' anything, but first need money to build one, but I'm not interested in profit so much as getting these labs up globally for abundant access so people can make what they want to have (rather than purchasing it). In prospect, once these labs are ubiquitous, I will ask "how can I make this?" rather than "where can I buy this?" Knowing this foreseeable reality makes the presentation of Open Business plans even more relevant

I then go to the market and see what's selling for a high return that's easiest to make with as few tools and resources as possible. Once I've reverse engineered (open sourced) the thing and simplified the production process (potentially ignorant of patent law) I can now build it in our feeble lab and sell it for a return (like on Ebay) in order to put more tools in the lab which are then reverse engineered and resold to produce more fabrication tools and so on until a fully replicable Open Source Fab Lab is in every town around the world.
