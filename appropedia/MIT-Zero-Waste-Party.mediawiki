''Some interesting Facts:
''

- Each individual generates about 1.5 tons of solid waste per year - about
4.5 pounds per person, per day. If we continue this pattern, we'll each
create 90,000 pounds of trash in our lifetime (Resource Conservation
Challenge, EPA, 2002)

- 55.4% of municipal solid waste is landfilled in 2003 (EPA)

- Landfills rank #2 in highest greenhouse gas emissions in the US (after
fossil fuel combustion) (White House Taskforce on Recycling, 1998)

- 1,830,000 tons of disposable plates and cups were used in the US in 1997
(up from 270,000 tons in 1960) (EPA, 1998)

- 58% of municipal waste (by weight) are packaging and containers, or
disposable products such as paper and plastic cups and plates, junk mail,
trash bags, and tissue papers and towels. (EPA, 2003)
