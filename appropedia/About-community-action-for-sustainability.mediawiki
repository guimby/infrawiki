<big>'''Community action for sustainability'''</big>, or CASwiki is a collection of information that's 
*free, and free to reuse
*about all aspects of local and community-run [[sustainability]] action
*collaborative and inclusive
*action or activism focussed
and adopts 
*a positive, 'can do' approach

Some starting points - [[CASwiki places|Places]], [[CASwiki topics|Topics]], [[CASwiki resources|Resources]]

== Who? ==
[[File:Twin-Cities-Marathon-2006-Minneapolis.jpg|left|150px]]
CASwiki is for, and can be by, anyone and everyone interested in [[sustainability]], but especially ordinary people and community groups. 

Sustainability isn't just something for experts. It's about everyone's [[quality of life]] and we all have a part to play. [[Community involvement]], inclusion and empowerment are seen here as an integral part of sustainability.

It's also about joining up or networking and collaboration. / [[Join community action for sustainability|Join our community]]

== Where? ==
[[File:240px-The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|150px]]
CASwiki aims to link up community and personal action for sustainability '''worldwide'''. 

'''Local, personal and global ''' - It's about local sustainability - any size area from [[CASwiki places|local community to the whole planet]], but in a way which interconnects the [[:category:Personal options|personal]] and the [[Global connections|global]].
 
== When? ==

'''Now'''. This stuff matters. Some would say [[Sustainability - the basics#Tempted to panic|it's urgent]]. If you can help, do it now. Your planetary community needs you! 

We began 6/12/04, but there's massive potential for further development.

== How and why? ==

=== "Only connect" ===

Joining up - the highly interlinked nature of the wiki can be especially useful in developing holistic or '''integrated''' awareness.

To help with [[Sustainability - the basics#Seeing the bigger picture|seeing the bigger picture]], articles which provide an overview or summary can be especially useful. / [[Why grow community action for sustainability?]]

== Do ==

'''Do share! Do please share''' your knowledge and ideas for action to help bring about more sustainable communities and a more sustainable world. This might be about how to make where you find yourself a better place to live, work or visit.

Sharing is good. Share YOUR knowledge - so's those of us interested in local sustainability don't have to keep reinventing the wheel.
Together we're stronger. The more sustainability information we share, the more we all benefit.
