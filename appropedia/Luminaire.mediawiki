A luminaire is a complete electric light unit. The components of a luminaire include one or more lamps, optics, ballasts or drivers, power supplies, and any wiring accessories that would complete the powering and operation of an artificial light lamp. Luminaires can be designed to house incandescent, fluorescent, and LED lights.
