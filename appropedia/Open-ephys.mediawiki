Electrophysiology is the study of the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues. [http://open-ephys.org/ open-ephys] works on open-source electrophysiology. They are a team of neuroscientists who want to make it easier to share their tools.

To that end, they have created Open Ephys to publicize the projects they are working on right now.

This page shows [[open source]] scientific hardware, which can be used to make [[open source labs]] developed by [http://open-ephys.org/ open-ephys] .
