== Introduction ==
Mention CCAT and stuff, make sure you make references and links to my page [[CCAT natural wall construction]]. Have fun with this page and keep the [[help]] page open in another tab to refer to, it works great to just copy and paste format things from the [[help]] page into your page.

== Costs ==
Ok this is the most difficult part of Appropedia formatting to visualize so i just put in my table.  It helps to click 'show preview' so you can see the finished product as well as the formatting at the same time. Just fill in your cost information for the table below.  And just delete any extra boxes left but remember to leave the ''''|}'''' at the end of the whole table format.

==Testing==
== Purposed Timeline ==
Here is a format for a time line that seems to work well in appropedia, just fill in your data, notice that the '!' marks match the titles of the columns, so all you have to remember is that for each ''''align="center"'''' box, the first line is the item, second is date, third is whether or not you met that date.

== Project in Construction ==
Below i have included what i did for many of my pictures.  I put them in a gallery, the format is below, all that you need to do is fill in the space after ''''image:'''' with your picture files you have uploaded 'see the upload a file on the left sidebar to learn how. After the ''''|'''' line you can add a caption to the photos, just delete it if you do not want a caption, but it helps.

Image:Clay Slip Drilling.jpg|Mixing clay found on-site for the clay-slip-straw using a power drill with a paint mixing paddle
Image:Breaking Up Chunks.jpg|The drill couldn't breakup all the small chunks so we did it by hand
Image:Straw Mixing.jpg|The straw was mixed and turned till all just covered by the clay slip
Image:Clay-Slip-Straw.jpg| The clay is then stuffed into the wood lath frame and ends up drying and looking like this ready to plaster.
Image:Mixing_papercrete_CCAT.jpg| It takes about 5 minutes of mixing with a power drill with a paint mixing paddle for wet shredded paper to pulp like this before adding cement

Image:Paper-crete_Brick_Form.jpg|This is the form we used to make the bricks used in the wall. When the bricks dry, they shrink, making the form easy to lift off
