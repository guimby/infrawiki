Highland "grain", a traditional crop in the [[Andes]]. This pinhead-size seed originated in South America. It is pronounced "keen-wa". This grain contains a high level of protein and fibre. It is lower in carbohydrate than rice or couscous.

Quinoa comes in a variety of colours, including beige, red-brown or black.

== Cooking quinoa ==
Rinse the seeds before cooking; they have a natural coating of saponin which is bitter tasting. Although this is usually washed off during processing for sale, it's a good idea to rinse prior to cooking.

To cook, place into a cooking pot filled with boiling water of double the amount of the quinoa to be cooked. It can be helpful to add a pinch of salt.

Cook at a simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. When the water has been absorbed by the quinoa and the seeds appear translucent, the quinoa is ready to be served or added to a dish of your choosing.
