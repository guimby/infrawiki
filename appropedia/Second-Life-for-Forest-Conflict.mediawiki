== avatar for seeing exhibit ==

Spector Woodford - salasana, think of the top of the house.

== To do List ==

Get a space / Buy Land

Start artefact hunting - we need Trees, Water, Boards for showing "screen show" that goes in each stream (MEDIA, NARRATIVE, PEOPLE POWER, NATURE POWER)

Identify locations that will represent these places.

is meeting that ismo and markus and mikko had in 2nd life and the google doc after. Gives to do list for first week of may - most of meaningful content is moved away.

== Land locations looked at ==

*GUIDE LINES

It would be ideal to find a place size of 8000 m2 that has neighbors that fit visually to our project. Also 4000 m2 sized area can be used. But smaller than that can be problematic.
Max price for the land could be 200$ or 52000 L$

IMPORTANT: when you visit the land, check the place profile from the world -menu. There is a OBJECTS -category under which you see how many prims you can have in the area. The more the better. Prims are important when adding new object in the area. Also, if the area is owned by a private company or individual, check the GENERAL -category and the possible restrictions. In some places you are not allowed to
do anything you want even if you own the land which sucks... If the land is on the mainland area then we need to have a premium account to buy it.

So the plan could be that you try to find as many potential places as possible and on Tuesday we go them through.
My estimation is based on the land fee prices. We must pay a fee when we own any land in SF. So for the 8000 m2 area the fee could be
360$/9months. Then we could have 200 euros for objects and stuff and I think that would be enough...

8,192 m2=40$/kk =360$ (9months)
4,096 m2=25$/kk =225$ (9months)
