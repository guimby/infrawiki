The late '''Meredith Thring''' was an advocate of technology for developing countries.
:"He set up the charity '[[Power Aid]]' to develop engineering equipment for in [[rural]] areas and, at the time of his death, he was seeking to secure the charity's future, specifically for a project to develop a village-size [[Leaf Fractionation Apparatus]] which could be built and used in [[Nigeria]]. It would produce Leaf Concentrate, a protein- rich diet supplement, from plants."
:"He worked out ways to harvest the weed [[water hyacinth]] from [[Lake Victoria]] and turn it into food, acting as a personal [[consultant]] to President Yoweri Museveni of [[Uganda]] on this subject."
