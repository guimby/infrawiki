==Introduction==
Abundant Water is an open innovation project to develop a simple and cheap [[water filter]] that can be made anywhere by almost anyone.

Details can be found here: http://abundantwater.org
Project includes:
* filter design
* pilot filter use in remote villages
* monitor and evaluate the production and use of the filter
* capture information and place it into an information document for water and sanitation organisations to enable them to replicate this process.

The project began in mid 2008 and has now developed a filter that can be made and used in the field.  This has all been accomplished using traditional Lao potting techniques.  

This project seeks to make appropriate technology and employs open innovation methods.  All are welcome to explore the project and make use of the information or make a contribution however is suitable.
