Freedom is a vital concept in human development.

It is applied in various fields:
* [[International development]]: Note the book [[Development as Freedom]] by [[Amartya Sen]], and the related  concepts of [[participation]] and [[empowerment]].
* [[Information technology]]: [[Software freedom]] is crucial to allowing control and choice in the software we use, and freedom from control by those who provide software. 
* [[Open hardware]] - similar to the concept of software freedom, above.
* [[Economics]]: The freedom to act in one's own [[self-interest]] is an important one in many economic theories, including the most influential ones today. However, it seems this leads to major problems if left unchecked and unguided. ([[Choice architecture]] offers ways of aiding more intelligent and positive decisions without enforcing them or impinging on personal freedom.)
* Politics - e.g. the "Four Freedoms"{{w|Four Freedoms}} were goals articulated by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt:
:# [[Freedom of speech]] and expression
:# [[Freedom of religion]]
:# Freedom from want
:# Freedom from fear
