The central kitchen of '''Mumbai Port Trust''' (MBPT) distributes food to approximately 3,000 employees daily, generating valuable amounts of organic waste. A terrace garden created by staff recycles ninety percent of this waste, and produces vegetables and fruits. Preeti Patil, the catering officer at the MBPT explains the purpose of the enterprise: <blockquote>
“Mumbai Port Trust has developed an organic farm on the terrace of its central kitchen, which is an area of approximately 3000 sqft [300 m2]. The activity of city farming was started initially to dispose of kitchen organic waste in an ecofriendly way. Staff members, after their daily work in the kitchen, tend the garden, which has about 150 plants.” <ref>Roshni Udyavar et al., “Development of City Farms by Street Children”</ref>
