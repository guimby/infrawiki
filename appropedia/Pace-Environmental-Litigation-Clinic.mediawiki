'''[http://www.pace.edu/page.cfm?doc_id=23238 The Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic]''' intensively immerses students in an [[environmental law]] practice representing public interest groups, primarily the [[Riverkeeper]], Inc. The Riverkeeper's mission is to protect the waters of the Hudson River system from the Adirondacks to Long Island Sound. The Clinic represents Riverkeeper in courts, administrative proceedings and occasionally in local proceedings. Clinic students represent Riverkeeper in these proceedings. Their efforts have led to precedent setting decisions by federal courts under both the [[Clean Water Act]]{{w|Clean Water Act}} and the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]]{{w|Resource Conservation and Recovery Act}}.

The Environmental Litigation Clinic requires a substantial time commitment.

To do: It would be really useful to see how RFK Jr. set this up and then replicate it at all the other law schools...No more [[pollution]].
