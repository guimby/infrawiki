'''OpenCourseWare''' (or '''OCW''') is a form of [[Open Educational Resources]]. It is free [[coursework]], usually from universities, which can be freely accessed via the [[internet resources|internet]]. Only the material is free - instruction is not provided. It may be used by any individuals including students and teachers, or by institutions.

OpenCourseWare is sometimes (always?{{fact}}) [[open access]] content rather than [[open licensed]] content (i.e. there may be restrictions on your [[freedom]] in reusing and adapting it).

Subjects covered include [[public health]] and other development and [[sustainability]] related topics. See [[Open Educational Resources]] for specific courses.
