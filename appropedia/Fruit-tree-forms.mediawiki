The shapes of most [[fruit trees]] can be manipulated by [[Pruning fruit trees|pruning]] and training in order to
increase yield, or to improve their suitability for different situations and conditions.
Pruning a tree to a [[pyramid shape]] means that trees can be planted closer together. An
open bowl or cup form increases the penetration of sunlight, thus encouraging a high
fruit yield whilst keeping the tree short and easy to pick from. Other shapes such as
[[cordon]]s, [[espalier]]s and fans offer opportunities for growing trees two dimensionally
against walls or fences, or can themselves be trained as barriers.


'''Bush trees''' are the traditional open goblet shaped form, with a clear lower stem.

'''Cordons''' are single stemmed trees with fruiting spurs planted at an angle. Any side
branches are removed by pruning. cordons take less space and crop earlier than most
other forms which means that more varieties can be got into a small space, but yields
are smaller per tree.

'''Espaliers''' have a central vertical trunk with three or four horizontal branches each side.

'''Fans''' have a short central trunk with several radiating branches growing from the
crown.

'''Step-over espaliers''' have single horizontal branches @ 1’ from the ground and make a
novel and productive border to the vegetable plot.

All of these shapes require training by tying the branches to the required form, and
pruning to retain the desired structure. This is usually carried out in autumn for major
cutting back and late summer for light trimming. Autumn pruning encourages woody
growth whilst late summer pruning encourages fruiting.
Not all trees will accept all of the shapes above- [[Apple (fruit)|apple]]s and [[pear]]s do well as cordons
and espaliers for example, whereas cherries prefer to be fanned.
