=== Road safety ===

{{#widget:YouTube|id=-vzDDMzq7d0}}

Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Poynton#Transport|Poynton, Transport]]: In December 2011, the village road network was reconstructed at the intersection of Chester Road/Park Lane and London Road, creating the first "double roundel" for a high traffic intersection. Similar to a roundabout, the new intersection reduces the four-lane approaches to two lanes, allowing pedestrians to cross quickly, and safely allowing the elimination of traffic signals. Multiple coloured and textured cobbles separate traffic from pedestrians areas, however it functions as a shared space, allowing pedestrians to cross anywhere that feels safe. According to the city, businesses have seen increased foot traffic, and congestion has been considerably lessened. The total cost was 4 million pounds, comparable to traditional road repairs which were needed.

=== Trees, woodland and forest ===

[http://www.merseyforest.org.uk/ The Mersey Forest] is a network of woodlands and green spaces being created across Merseyside and North Cheshire by a wide-ranging partnership of different organisations including local authorities, community groups and businesses. The Mersey Forest is the biggest of twelve community forests covering 420 square miles (1,100 km2) and accessible to a local population of 1.6 million people. It stretches from Sefton to the north of [[Liverpool]] and south to Northwich in Cheshire. Delamere Forest in the south of the area being the largest area of established woodland. The forest is seen as having a major role in attracting new business and tourism to the area.

In common with the other community forests it is not a contiguous area of forest, but rather an initiative to increase forestry coverage in an area close to urban communities. An example of this at work is Griffin Wood, clearly visible from the M62 just to the south of St. Helens. This woodland was established in 2007, including Scott's Copse, planted in recognition of the work done by David Scott.

Passengers at Liverpool's John Lennon Airport are able to offset the carbon used on their flight. The money raised is matched by the airport and used by Mersey Forest to plant new trees. {{W|Mersey Forest}}
