'''Rural development''' issues include:
* The need for [[appropriate technology]], in particular recognizing the [[context]] of limited technical support, and thus the need for reliability and maintenance with available skills and tools.
* [[Transport]] - access to transport can be difficult, especially for those without access to private vehicles, and expensive in any case.
* [[Food security]] - especially in poor areas and where transport and logistics are not in place.
