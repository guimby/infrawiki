|[http://www.cbsm.com/cases/payasyouthrow+in+pennsylvania_123 Pay-As-You-Throw Garbage Collection]
|This program has been implemented in over 211 communities around Pennsylvania. Essentially, the community chooses the fee amount and what the money will be used for, making it very adaptable worldwide. Since implementation this program has greatly reduced the amount of waste generated, in some cases as much as 50%.
|These communities that have this program in place are fairly small. However, this system could work in all sized communities, and in all areas of the globe where trash collection takes place. 
|Small-->Large
|This is a good example of a policy that communities can choose to adopt. Once in place this policy can quickly cause change because a new social norm is developed.
