'''Knowledge management for development''' is widely recognized as international development

[[Knowledge management]] in the fields of [[aid]] and [[international development]] involves many factors, including:
* Sharing expertise between organizations in related areas
* Sharing knowledge between the different agents in development - external actors (consultants, NGOs, activists), program participants and other stakeholders.

A radical [[open development]] approach involves:
* Opening up [[information silos]]
* [[Knowledge sharing]], [[open data]] and [[transparency]] as fundamental to development.

This can be seen in the context of Amartya Sen's [[Development as Freedom]], as development constituted by the free access to the knowledge needed for to empower and enable the "targets" of development to become informed, make decisions and take action for themselves.

[[Appropedia]]'s role as an [[open development wiki]] is an example of an extremely open approach to knowledge management in development.
