==Abstract==
# This device collects rain water in a water bottle or any container that has standard bottle threads.  It includes a purge container that collects the initial dirty rain water.  The reason this water is dirty is due to the sediment that collects on a roof between rain cycles.  Once the purge container is filled a ball floats to the top and closes of this container and the clean rain water is diverted into the water bottle.

== Bill of Materials==
# All compents are 3D printable but glue is needed to secure the purge main to the bottle collector and a container with standard bottle thread is need to collect clean water.
# The file used for the bottle neck threads and funnel were designed by laird can be found here [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:157541]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Liquid glue ex: Super Glue or 5 Min Epoxy

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Basic 3D printer knowledge

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
  To construct the rain water collector 
## Print out the following parts using supports
* Water Collector Purge [[Water Collector Purge .stl]]
* Water Purge Pipe   [[File:Purge pipe.stl]]
* Water collector filler  [[File:Water collector filler.stl]]
* Water collector funnel  [[File:Water collector funnel.stl]]
## Then you have to scale the ScrewBall by .55 in your slicer ex. Cura
* ScrewBall [[File:Screwball 7.stl]] Source [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:61205]
## Insert the Water Collector Purge Part into the Water Collector Filler with a bead of liquid glue on the connector
## Screw the ball together 
## Optional:  Add a bead of glue around ball seam to insure ball is water tight
## Place the ball inside the purge pipe 
## Place the purge pipe over the open pipe on the Water Collector Purge part
## Insert the Water Collector Funnel in the open hole on the Water Collector Purge part
## Screw Water bottle into the final pipe on the Water Collector Filler
