The '''S.T.E.V.E.N. Low-Cost Windmill''' is based on very low cost and self- help (a mill constructed and operated near oneâ€™s home) chooses another approach. This [[windmill]] is based on 1: a skeleton structure resisting even the strongest winds, and 2: a set of wings or blades, which are very easily replaced should a strong wind destroy them, and which can be purchased for between ten and twenty dollars for all four blades. Thus the windmill can be totally protected in its skeleton form from extreme wind, and its totality can be secured at very low cost. How low, is one of the principal objectives of the designer's research.
