Masonry stoves are heating stoves developed in medieval Europe, or even earlier. Some sources are mentioning some kind of similar Roman stoves.

It is a wood burning stove with high efficiency and high thermal mass.
Because of that mass it can accumulate heat in the fireplace and the result is a great efficiency because most of the wood gases are burnt.
It is an efficient ecological alternative to ordinary wood burning stoves.
