'''Pesticides''' are substances used to kill insects, plants and other organisms that negatively impact [[crop]] yield. They can range from hazardous, artificially-isolated chemicals, such as many organochlorides, to relatively innocuous plant-based preparations, like [[Original:Neem A Tree for Solving Global Problems 9|neem oil]]. Pesticides can have unintended consequences such as killing off beneficial, predatory insects.
