Leaf curd (or leaf concentrate) is the name for extracted plant proteins from edible plant leaves.

In many places where animal protein consumption is not appropriate, finding alternative low-cost plant-based proteins can be very problematic.  Whilst some cultures have a history of using tofu - bean curds - these are not universally accepted for consumption.  

Very generally, the process involves breaking up plant leaves manually, then bringing the mash to the boil in a boil of water.  The proteins can then be scraped off the surface of the water and excess water removed.
