'''Container composting''' - There are sound reasons for [[compost]]ing in containers, although there is debate as to whether slatted or closed sided [[bin]]s are preferable, for this will affect air circulation within the compost pile, as well as the potential for [[heat]] loss. The ''Indore'' method developed by Sir Albert Howard and the ''Shewell Cooper'' method favour slats, while the ''New Zealand Box'' method advocates the use of closed sides. There are also differences between these techniques in terms of activators (that is, high [[nitrogen]] content [[organic material|organic]] substances to stimulate high [[bacteria|bacterial]] activity within the heap, e.g., [[urine]], [[grass]] mowings, [[comfrey]] [[leaf|leaves]], etc.) and materials used. However, most agree that a good mixture of [[carbon]] and nitrogenous materials, usually created in layers and on a base consisting of rougher, stemmy material (to encourage [[air]] circulation) that is in contact with the soil are essential to all successful composting processes.

For those who do not have a lot of space, composting can be carried out with good results by using cylindrical bins provided that attention is paid to the all-important issues of aeration and [[Carbon:Nitrogen ratio|C:N]] ratios. Such bins are available proprietarily, and are often supplied by local authorities at low cost to encourage [[recycling]].
