This method emphasizes movable fencing relocated onto new pasture at set intervals. This moves the entire flock, avoiding overgrazing, disease and pest problems and spreads the benefits of the flock across the involved areas.  


==Equipment==

Coops: A movable coop is standard practice; chicken tractors are commonly also used though this may not avoid all predators.
Waterers: standard chicken watering equipment
Fences: electric fences, plastic netting and posts, and (with clipped wingfeathers) even modular doggie pens for smaller flocks.  


==Examples==
Polyface Farm's Pastured Poultry
