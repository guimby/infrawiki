'''St. Louis'''

Solidarity Economy St. Louis is currently working to incubate African-American cooperative businesses, co-host a local conference around the theme of "Health, Wealth, and Disrupting Capitalism," develop a time bank youth court program, engage in community organizing efforts to create a neighborhood food hub in the food desert of North St. Louis, and promote community development of vacant land.

"Being part of the Mutual Aid Network allows us to connect to and co-create a global movement of people who are working to build just and sustainable economies," says Julia Ho, founder of Solidarity Economy St. Louis. "The only way for us to truly achieve mutual aid in our own communities is by extending mutual aid to others." <ref>[http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-mutual-aid-network-takes-a-ground-up-approach-to-create-a-collaborative-economy Shareable]</ref>
