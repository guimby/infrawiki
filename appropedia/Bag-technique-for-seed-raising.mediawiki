The '''plastic bag technique''' for [[raising seedlings]] is a simple and effective technique suitable for [[lazy gardening]] (aka efficient gardening). It reduces your work of watering, and increases the servival rate of the seedlings

# Plant your [[seeds]] in the pot or seed tray. 
# Water and place it in a plastic bag (or at least cover the mouth of the pot). A colored plastic bag is acceptable, but should will allow some light through. 
# Ensure there is a gap to allow air to circulate - or a number of holes in the plastic.
# If the weather is cold (e.g. planting early to get a jump start on the season) place in a sunny and/or mild/warm position.
# If the weather is hot, the bag will reduce loss of moisture. Keep out of the sun to avoid cooking the seeds/seedlings.

By doing this directly in the pot where the plant is to grow, you can avoid [[transplanting seedlings]] - which makes the process simpler, easier and more reliable.
