{{topic header| default.png |Cookers}}

A '''cooker''' is device for preparing [[food]]. Cookers may be as simple as a container/pot or may also contain a heating chamber where fuel can be burned. They may also refer to ''only'' the heating chamber/device. Consequently, they may refer to:
* [[Kitchen stove]]s (British English)
* [[Gas stove]]s (British English)
* [[Ultraviolet ovens]]
* [[Solid biofuel stoves]]
* [[Solar cooker]]s
* [[Electric cooker]]s
* [[Induction cooker]]s
* [[Pressure cooker]]s
* [[Rice cooker]]s
* [[Slow cooker]]s
* [[Egg cooker]]s
* [[AGA cooker]]s

==Using cookers efficiently==
{{Main|Updated cooking methods in modern kitchens}}
Any cooker can be used more efficient by following some simple principles: 
*Always use a lid when boiling. 
*Use a larger cooking pot (when it is appropriate to cook a larger amount). Cooking in Larger amounts is more energy efficient than cooking in a smaller amount. 
*A wide shallow pot is better at capturing the heat than a tall narrow one.
*For a wood stove, having more than one pot on the stove at one time makes better use of the fire, i.e. more efficient. Of course, this assumes the stove is designed for more than one pot - trying to balance more than one pot on a one-pot stove is to be avoided, as it could lead to spills and possible injury.

==Food safety==
Care must be taken when using a [[slow cooker]]{{w|slow cooker}}, [[fireless cooker]] (i.e. insulated boxes for maintaining a pot at high temperature) or [[solar cooker]]:
*If meat is used, an adequate temperature must be used to ensure the safety of the meat. {Please link to suitable Wikipedia article or other resource describing the temperatures and times needed.{{fact}})
*If legumes are used, especially kidney beans or chick peas, they must be cooked at a high enough temperature for sufficient time (e.g. at 100 deg C for 20 minutes) to destroy toxic substances, and avoid food poisoning. Cooking at a lower temperature (e.g. 80 deg C) can actually increase toxicity. See [[Wikipedia:Bean#Toxins]]. This might also be an issue when cooking legumes at high altitudes, e.g. in [[Bolivia]].
