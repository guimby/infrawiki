Kurpistsatalo is the informal name for the community garden association in Pispala. It promotes alternatives ways of growing and traditional agrarian related culture. SO for example Kehkri (Samhain equivalnet suomessa that follows the old pagan ways tied to the land) is celebrated there rather than the imported Halloween (secularized and poorly connected with the indigenous culture).

It has been proposed to run a kasvitietotalkoot at Kurpitsatalo as part of the Tampere Social Forum. It is being co-ordinated in co-operation with those in Hirvitalo that took part in Pixelache 2010 events.
