{{topic header| default.png |Gasification}}
'''Gasification''' is a process of heating carbonaceous materials, in the presence of limited oxygen, to form carbon monoxide hydrogen and methane; which is then burnt in a second stage (where we get CO<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O+heat). This is done to achieve higher efficiencies, getting more energy from the fuel, and reducing most pollutants. 

Gasification is useful in:
*Coal power stations. This can make coal burn more cleanly and efficiently. Note that burning coal "cleanly" avoids the production of hydrocarbons (which are more serious [[greenhouse gases]] than carbon dioxide) but even in the best case, coal is a serious contributor to greenhouse gases. 
*[[Biomass gasification]], including:
**[[Gasifying stoves]],[http://www.bioenergylists.org/en/node/185] a type of [[improved cookstove]] for the majority world.
