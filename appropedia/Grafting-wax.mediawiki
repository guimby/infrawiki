*10 ounces (weight) [[rosin]]
*2 ounces (weight) [[beeswax]]
*1 ounce (weight) [[charcoal]] powder
*1-tablespoon [[linseed oil]]

Grafting wax seals the union of plant tissue. Heat the beeswax and rosin at 250 degrees F. until they melt. Stir in the remaining ingredients.

===from the [[Household Cyclopedia]]===

Five parts of [[rosin]], 1 part of [[beeswax]], 1 part of [[tallow]]. Melt these in a skillet, tin cup, or any metal vessel, the skillet being preferable, as it can be handled better, and the wax keeps warm longer in it. Mix these over the fire, and mix together well. When the scions are set – say as many as 20 or 30, or as few as wished – have the mixture ready and apply it warm with a small wooden paddle. 

See that every part is covered, and the air completely excluded. It requires no bandage. We have made the wax in different proportions to the above, but we find these to be best adapted to the purpose. The object to be attained is to have the wax of such consistency that it will not crack in the cold winds of March and April, nor run in the hot suns of summer.
