If someone suggests you '''release your content on Appropedia''', this means:
* you own the rights to the work (i.e. it's not a news article, or the property of your employee, or otherwise restricted)
* you place it onto Appropedia (by creating or editing a new page and pasting it in, or contacting someone for help if it needs to be [[port]]ed from a different format)
* by doing this you release the work under Appropedia's [[Appropedia:Copyrights|Copyrights]] policy ([[CC-by-sa]]). You retain all the rights you always had, but you now share most of those rights with others.
