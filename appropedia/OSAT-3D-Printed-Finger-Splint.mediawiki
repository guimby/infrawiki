==Abstract==
This is a 3D printed finger splint used for immobilizing fingers to facilitate healing. Within the medical field, studies have been found that 3D printed casts or braces allow a patient to heal faster compared to conventional braces. They are designed with a more aesthetically pleasing look while allowing the wounded limb to breathe and heal faster by not covering the entirety of the limb.

== Bill of Materials==
# 1.75mm PLA Plastic Filament. Full roll - $23.00. Length required for print - $1.50
## All Files located here: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/3d-finger-brace

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer


== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
Understanding of OpenScad

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Open (or install and then open) Cura
# Select File -> Load Model File. Open closed_brace.stl and the model should appear on Cura
# The initial model file will appear, but the scale will need to be altered in order for the finger to fit. It is recommended to use a set of calipers to obtain the measurements on the finger.
# Click on the model, and then click Scale. Set Size Z(mm) to the thickness of the finger.
# Unlock Uniform Scale. Set Size X (mm) to the length of the finger.
Once the scaling settings are set, under the basic tab, change the following
# Layer Height (mm): 0.25
# Shell Thickness (mm): 1.0
# Fill Density (%): 90
# Print Speed (m/s): 65
Under the advanced tab, change the following
# Initial Layer Thickness (mm): 0.25
The expected time to print will range between 45 to 65 minutes, depending on the brace size for the finger. Since this is one part, there is no assembly required


=== Common Problems and Solutions===
One common problem will be the length of the brace. If the finger has too much of a gap once the brace is on, the best way will be to scale down the X width in Cura. Ensure that Uniform Scaling is deselected and scale down the X width to accommodate the proper length for your finger.

== Cost savings==
# Price for Plastic - $1.50
# Commercial Splints - $8.00 low end to $25.00 higher end
# Low End Savings: $6.50 (82% savings) High End Savings: $23.50 (94% savings)
