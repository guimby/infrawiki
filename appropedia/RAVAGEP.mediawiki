RAVAGEP is a Haitian grass roots organization located in Bwa Nèf (Bois Neuf), in the nortg of Cité Soleil, Port-au-Prince. RAVAGEP was founded by Samuel Cadet (shown in the image to the right) to promote community growth and education. Some of the programs RAVAGEP has facilitated include environmental seminars, HIV/AIDS education seminars, sports programs, a work party to construct a community toilet, and the upkeep of two community gardens. 

The garden is a valuable resource for the community, but the water that runs into it is heavily polluted. Cité Soleil is the last stop for a canal that flows through and is used by many other communities in Port-au-Prince. At the garden the canal is unsanitary and dangerously polluted. RAVAGEP has conducted and is undergoing various permaculture experiments in the garden to improve production methods. RAVAGEP has worked with [[Haiti Communitere]] to explore ways to clean the water and for community project ideas like building benches out of upcycled materials.

In 2014, RAVAGEP moved its focus to a vegetable garden/community space out of the flood zone of the canal. This is a place to run trainings as well as a demonstration of growing amaranth, [[moringa]] and various vegetables.
