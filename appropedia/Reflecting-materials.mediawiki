|-
| Polished Anodized Aluminum
| ~95%
| Light
| ~$7/square foot
| Reflective, lightweight, can be salvaged, structurally durable, easily flexed and shaped
| Easily scratched, not super cheap
|-
| Mylar
| >98%
| Super light
| $30 for a 4'x'50 roll
| Super reflective, super light, super cheap
| Not good at standing up to the elements, forms 'bubbles' if glue starts to give, requires a rigid backing
|-
| Aluminum Foil
| 88% on bright side
| Super light
| $3.29 for 1.5'x70' roll
| Extremely cheap and widely available
| Not so reflective, corrodes when mixed with acidic juices, structurally weak, would only last one or 2 sessions
|-
| Can lids
| 70-80% (my estimate)
| Light
| FREE
| Widely Available, effective, salvageable, did I mention free?!
| Not super reflective, non-uniform shape is labor intensive to use
|-
| Acrylic Mirror
| 99%
| Medium/Heavy
| $78 for 1'x4' plane
| Very reflective, nearly unbreakable
| Comes in plane, likely very difficult to fit to parabola and still maintain reflectivity, super expensive
|-
| Glass Mirror
| 99%
| Very heavy
| At least $100/square foot
| Super reflective, widespread- meaning it could be salvaged
| Very expensive new, comes in rigid plane- could be broken to fit paraboloid in mosiac in exchange for a precise focus
|- 
| Astro-foil
| 76%
| Light
| $37 for 1'x50' roll
| Relatively strong
| Not so relective

*Many potential materials with high reflectivity and strength are only available by special order from industrial companies. Though I have not tried to order or to ask for a donation of these fine products, the manufacturers usually deal in bulk. 
In addition, I am not sure a special-order industrial super-reflector meets this projects criteria of salvageablility and wide availability. That said, a bulk roll of high quality reflective material may be a wise investment for the aspiring do-it-yourself solar technician.
