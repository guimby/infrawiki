==Method==
To achieve dots in Inkscape:
*Zoom into the grid so that you are pretty close, and the grid's squares are consistent.  
*draw a line that is eight squares long (about equal to 1 cm)
*the laser welder's motors move it about this length before turning on the laser, and it turns it on for a very small length, yielding a dot.
'''Warning:'''

-Motors in laser welder are very inconsistent, and sometimes the Inkscape document does not look like the actual welded pattern.  

-Needs further investigation.

'''Important Check List:'''
*Do the patterns consistently work?
*Do your patterns match up in welder?
*Do your patterns line up consistently?
