'''Food preparation''' carried out with cookers, blenders, utensils and various appliances, can have a major impact on the nutritional value of the food, for better or worse.

Food that contains [[anti-nutrients]] must either be:
* Prepared properly to deactivate these compounds - e.g. foods such as cassava that contain [[cyanide]]s must be soaked, fermented and/or cooked in water for a long time; [[beans]] (especially kidney beans and check peas) must be cooked at high temperature (boiled at 100 deg C - the toxins can be made worse at 75 deg C). Pre-soaking may help.{{fact}}
* Eaten in moderation to keep exposure to safe levels - e.g. [[oxalates]].
