'''Paradise Valley''' in [[Morocco]] is one of the oldest [[forest garden]]s in the world (allegedly 2000 years). It is located near the coast, between the villages Inraren and Tamzergourte. 800 people from the area work in forest. The [[over-story]] is mainly [[date palm]], and the [[under-story]] includes [[carob]], [[banana]], [[quince]], [[olive]], [[fig]], [[pomegranate]], [[guava]], [[citrus]], [[mulberry]], [[tamarind]], and [[grape]]. Despite being surrounded by arid desert, the forest is cool and lush.
