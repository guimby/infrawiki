{{Akvo ATOC}}

:''For summary articles, see '''[[green wiki]]''' and '''[[open development wiki]]'''.''

There have been many green wikis, dating back to Ekopedia (started in 2002), Village Earth's [[Appropriate Technology Wiki Project]] (started in 2004) and [[Wiki Green]] (started in March 2006) - the last two of which have since joined forces with Appropedia, and the first of which is currently in discussions about a merger. (See [[Appropedia:Tributary wikis]] for a complete list of merged wikis - these wikis are not listed below.)

-- <small>insert edit count and page count in 0,000 format)</small> 



==Active wikis==

Active wikis with a focus on [[green living]], [[international development]], [[appropriate technology]] and related subjects, starting with the most active wikis, include the following. (If you find one that is inactive, please mark it ''Inactive'' and move to the bottom.)

Some fields have not been filled in (to complete every detail for every wiki would be extremely time consuming), but feel free to update and add to the table. (Leave the details on the talk page if you find the table markup confusing. We hope to have an easier way to edit tables, in time.)

'''Legend''': 
:'''Topics''':
:*G = Green '''green''' issues (specific or general) 
:*A = Activism and/or politics in sustainability.
:*Dev = Human and international development topics
::*ID = International development, [[poverty]], and humanitarian aid
::*HD = [[Human development]] more generally, not necessarily in less developed countries.
:*OD = [[Open design]], including [[Open Design Appropriate Technology]] and [[open hardware]].


'''Notes''': 
* This is a '''sortable table''' - click the icon on each column heading to sort by the various criteria - including activity ("Edits in 30 days), number of pages, and topics.
* Activity is assessed by the number of edits in 30 days, with certain exceptions.<ref name="EDIT COUNT">"Minor" edits have been counted, as there is no consistent culture between users and wikis as to what is marked as minor. Bot edits are not counted. An attempt has been made to exclude welcome templates on talk pages; new user creation is also not counted, as there is no way of know to easily tell whether it is a serious editor or a spam bot account. Where spam and vandalism is noticeable, an attempt has been made to exclude this and the reversion of spam from the count. (While reversion of spam is a sign of collaboration, it is maintenance rather than creation of content.)</ref> This is not a highly accurate measure of activity, as edits vary widely in size and quality - however it's a useful initial indicator. This number is followed by "RC" which is a link to RecentChanges for 30 days, where available. 
* In some cases the wiki only allows the last 7 days to be viewed; in this case an estimate is made for 30 days (multiplying by 30/7), and this is noted.
* Start date has sometimes been based on when the main page was created, when other data has not been found - in these cases it is marked.<ref name="MAIN PAGE START">Based on the start date of main page, from its page history</ref> This could be an underestimate of age in some cases, if the wiki or the front page has moved.

! Pages<ref>For MediaWiki this is taken from the number of probably legitimate pages on the '''Special:Statistics''' page. For other wikis, an AllPages or Sitemap page is used where available, though this usually leads to a higher figure as it includes tiny stubs and empty pages.

== International development wikis ==
Wikis which are focused on international development rather than sustainability per se, yet to be added include: 
* [http://www.demotech.org/pmwiki Demotech]

A list of these wikis including those focused more on international development (e.g. [http://www.akvo.org/wiki Akvopedia], [http://www.demotech.org/pmwiki Demotech],<ref name="non MW" /> [http://www.grassrootswiki.org/ GrassrootsWiki], [http://www.howtopedia.org/ Howtopedia], and the [http://solarcooking.wikia.com/ Solar Cooking Archive Wiki]) is found at [[SWS included sites list]] - this is intended to be the basis of a cross-wiki search.

== Writings ==

* [http://chriswaterguy.livejournal.com/1298.html Greenoptions.com - let's have some wiki synergy!] by [[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]], 07 Feb, 2007. 
::"But the good is the enemy of the best. Even a good site can be a distraction, if it draws people in but fails to provide the best available content and the most vibrant community. And the best way to provide those things is to work with likeminded people who are already working on the same thing."

== Very broad wikis ==
Other wikis have substantial amounts of content, in bodies of knowledge that are much more unrestricted in topic, but restricted in content type:
* Wikipedia (restricted to information verifiable by secondary sources, topical information, no personal experience, designs, how tos, instructions, ideas or collaborations related to anything off-site. See [[Wikipedia:Project:What Wikipedia is not]].)
* wikiHow (how tos on almost any topic, e.g. [http://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Sustainable-Agriculture How To Practice Sustainable Agriculture].)

These in particular are very active. Many contributors are active across a range of topics that interest them - or simply help to maintain the pages, regardless of topic. This has been a very successful model - these are some of the largest wikis in terms of both contributions and traffic.

== Analysis ==
=== Why do some succeed and some not? ===

Promises and enthusiasm are not enough - note the enthusiasm and promises of many commenters associated with the Bright Green Wiki, launched by the prominent and popular site, WorldChanging in 2004. The wiki never became active.

The backing of a high profile entity and individuals and broad media attention would seem to have potential to attract many contributors, but there may be limited "stickiness" to their involvement. Wikia has extensive experience with wikis, and chose not to launch until it was ready with active, committed support (possibly with a paid worker); the site has been more active than the Bright Green Wiki, yet the interest generated by the media attention has not led to a high level of activity beyond a few main contributors, who were already involved before the launch{{fact}} - i.e. it is active, but at this stage it is not one of the most active on this list. This may be seen simply as a matter of timing - the attention is certainly a benefit, and the site is in the consciousness of those who saw the news of its launch, but actually building a base of contributors can be expected to be a much slower process. 

So what we see here is a relatively small conversion from reading with interest and commenting positively, to actually making contributions. And then most contributors make a relatively small number of contributions, relatively few going on to being active long-term contributors. Successfully growing the wiki requires improving these conversion rates and/or increasing the sheer numbers of people coming to the site in the first place. I.e. as a site's profile grows and more people come to contribute, the numbers may outweigh the lack of "stickiness."

Backing of solid organizations is also not a guarantee - the [[appropriate technology wiki]] was started by [[NGO collaboration movement | an NGO]] with a wealth of experience and knowledge, who seemed to find that it was not their core focus, and it was not feasible for overworked NGO workers to take on yet another project requiring intensive care. and even a UN body have had difficulty - note UNEP's [http://www.ungiwg.org/openwater/ OpenWater Wiki]). Note that this is not to criticize these efforts - where they use [[open licenses]], the work that has been done can be used elsewhere; and as wikis are a new technology, it is to be expected that there is a lot of experimentation

In other cases, of course, similar bodies have succeeded in establishing active wikis, for example UNDP's [http://www.waterwiki.net/index.php/Welcome WaterWiki] and the [http://solarcooking.wikia.com/ Solar Cooking Archive Wiki] started by Solar Cookers International. In these cases there has been an individual who has maintained a committment to the wiki, and others who have contributed in smaller ways, very likely influenced by the active person.

Community and geographically specific organizations have variable results also. The backing of academics seems to be a potentially positive influence, where these academics involve their students in the wiki as part of their coursework. The students may or may not continue to be actively involved (Appropedia's experience is that the continued involvement is generally small if at all) but it does create a wider community of contributors who can be contacted with specific questions when needed.

=== The role of the group ===
=== Local groups ===

Multiple communities within a shell - this is the approach of Appropedia, but it has not yet been successful in attracting communities (either organizations or locally based organizations). Also of the [http://www.transitiontowns.org/ Transition Towns Wiki], which has 96 subwikis, mostly locality based (see the [http://transitiontowns.org/Main/AllPages structure]), and of SolaRoof. These are both based on PmWiki, which allows for more customization of the interface based on the community currently being viewed; also more of a "tree" structure, which is perhaps more intuitive and more easily allows for the locality based structure to dominate.<ref>***Note questions discussed in the Appropedia community regarding maintaining group identity, in terms of a navbar/header that depends on the site the visitor came from; also discussions (on Twitter, between @appropedia and @MarkDilley?) about changing sidebar(?) based on the category being viewed. This requires software hacks?)</ref> Based on my own experience with wikis, and with my personal focus on locality-independent content, this strikes me as an inferior system from an information architecture perspective - however it does have a certain appeal, in terms of group identity and an architecture which is more easily grasped by the newcomer.

Note that although the local groups are very prominent in these two wikis, this is at least partly due to the fact that they have not created the same kind of locality-independent content. Both types of content are important, and finding ways to achieve both at the same time will be an important question for those in this area, in the next few years.

== Collaborative design? ==
The main focus of most of these wikis is sharing knowledge in some form ''other than design.'' Exceptions include:
* [[Appropedia:About|Appropedia]]
* [http://www.akvo.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Akvopedia]
* [http://openfarmtech.org Open Source Ecology] (The Factor E Farm wiki)
* [http://openenergymonitor.org Open Energy Monitor] Although not quite a wiki yet, it is open for anyone to get involved
(****scroll through)

Non-wikis include:
Projects with flexibility of input style:
* The [http://openarchitecturenetwork.org/ Open Architecture Network] (OAN), using visual presentation, consistent with traditional methods of architectural design. The site uses an open license, but does not allow editing of other designs, or easily duplicating another project in order to "fork" the design.

Projects aiming at a more structured form of input, which would enable tracking of changes to the design in a way analogous to the diffs in a wiki page. This looks very useful where the issues revolve around the precise design, but may be less useful for gaining participation by less technical people, or where the main issue to convey is a broad design concept, and where there is flexibility in the details of the design (e.g. a briquette press made from old wooden crates or branches).
* Sam Rose's project... (under construction).
* Fab Lab. This appears to have great strengths in making prototypes and sharing designs in electronic form to be reproduced elsewhere, as well as for making "one-off" objects and very low production run products. It would be presumably be more costly for items that can be mass-produced.

Sharing of designs where lack of openness may be a restriction include:
* Make
* Instructables
These have some similar challenges to the Open Architecture Network, mentioned above. 

=== Effect of merging ===

At face value, looking at the example of Appropedia ([[Appropedia:A history of collaboration]]), it may appear that merging has led to an activity decrease with in some green wikis - contributors from one of the wikis will tend to not contribute greatly to the combined effort. However, closer inspection of the timing of activity changes and broader patterns of wiki development reveals that:
* A big part of it is that most wikis don't really take off anyway, and many become inactive, merger or not. 
* In some clear cases they become inactive before the merger. In these cases the merger has not helped with getting the participants involved again, in practice. 

That's not to say it isn't a concern, and it needs further analysis.

The experience of Appropedia and [[WikiGreen]] suggests that merging is definitely best for visibility and traffic, and that brings more contributors. But the original contributors don't necessarily hang around - or, to be more accurate, don't necessarily start contributing again.
