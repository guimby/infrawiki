[[Plants]] have many potential uses, of which a pleasing appearance is one. However, one plant can serve many purposes, and to choose a '''plant''' purely for '''ornamental''' purposes is a [[wasted opportunity]] - losing the potential production of [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[shade]], [[windbreak]] or other benefits.

Note that many food plants are very attractive, especially when lush and well tended. There are many [[edible flowers]] for example, including large and showy ones such as [[dahlia]]s.

In a time of [[crisis]], and to build [[resilience]] at all times, it makes sense to choose only plants with [[Multi-purpose plant|[multiple uses]].
