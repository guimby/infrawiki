==Problem being addressed==
CD4 T cell counts are necessary for the monitoring and diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. These tests are often difficult and expensive. A low-cost, easy to use option is needed for use in resource-limited settings.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Guava Auto CD4/CD4% System is a unique bench-top instrument equiped with acquisition software that health providers can use to easily monitor patients' T-lymphocytes.  The Guava Auto CD4/CD4% System provides reliable results with minimum technical expertise to operate.  The system provides absolute CD4 counts, CD4% of total lymphocytes, and total lymphocyte count.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: Guava Technologies, Inc., but Millipore acquired Guava in 2009.
*Manufacturing: Headquarters located in Billerica, Massachusetts, USA.

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
Testing of the device has been done in the United States.  Performance has been evaluated in multiple laboratories against several well-accepted methods for determining absolute CD4 counts and CD4% values. Studies were performed on both adult and pediatric HIV samples as well as normal samples. Auto CD4/CD4% Assay test results were compared to results from other well established methods for CD4 analysis, showing consistently comparable results.
