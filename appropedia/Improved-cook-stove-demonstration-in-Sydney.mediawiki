This is an idea for a demonstration day for [[improved stove]]s, by a group of rocket hobbyists, possibly in collaboration with [[Engineers Without Borders NSW]] (Australia).

==Timing==
This was originally proposed for early 2007, but did not happen then. If anyone has an interest in doing this in future, contact one of the "Interested parties" below.

It could be done at:
* one of the [[EWB NSW]]'s [[Appropriate Technology Day (Sydney)]] (see for example the [[EWB NSW - Appropriate Technology Day 2006|2006]] and [[EWB NSW - Appropriate Technology Day 2007|2007]] events), or
* a separate event?

==Interest==
If you'll be in Sydney and interested in being directly involved, please add your name below. Ideally create an account and sign with four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>). It's best to use your email when you register so that you can be contacted easily. Or, leave another way of contacting you.

If you're not in Sydney, still feel free to contribute to this page as well as the [[Cook stove]] page.
