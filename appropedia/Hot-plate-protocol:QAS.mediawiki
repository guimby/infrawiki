===How to Operate the Hot Plate===

*First one needs either a Varac or a temperature controller
*In our case, we have a Cole-Parmer DigiSense Temperature Controller (K-Series temperature probe)

*Plug the hot plate into the back of the temperature controller
*Turn on the temperature controller and the hot plate
*Use the arrow keys found on the Omron Temperature Controller located on the hot plate to adjust to the desired temperature (SV)
*PV is the current temperature of the hot plate

NOTE:
*Temperature controller is a PID which means that it will go beyond the desired temperature before stabilizing to the desired temperature.

===Manual===
If you want to:
*Change the parameters of the PID
*Change the alarms

Please read the manual for step by step instructions.

===Safety===

*Don't touch the top of the hot plate while it is operational
