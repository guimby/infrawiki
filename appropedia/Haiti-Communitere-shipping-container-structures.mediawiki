==Overview==
[[Haiti Communitere]] has re-purposed a few shipping containers to serve as homes, offices, and storage spaces. The shipping container that has been converted into a living space has a bedroom, shower, toilet, and a kitchen. It also has air conditioning, because Haiti's climate is too warm for it to be habitable otherwise.
