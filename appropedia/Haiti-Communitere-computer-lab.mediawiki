The [[Haiti Communitere]] computer lab offers a wide variety of resources. 


==5 computers==
The lab has potential for five or more working laptop computers. Currently there is only one functional laptop, due to missing power sources and batteries. 

'''Functional'''
*Dell Latitude E6400

'''Needs Parts'''
*Power chargers for Dell Latitude E6400, quantity 3. Power charger specs: 18.5v 6.5 NON-STANDARD HP PLUG
*Laptop battery for Lenovo T400, quantity 1. 

If anyone is coming this way, and you can bring one or more of the replacement parts, that would be great!



==3D Printers==

[[Haiti Communitere]] has two 3D printers available in their computer lab. The 3D printers are a resource for people to create specifically shaped objects that otherwise cannot be found or easily made in Haiti.
