This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for [[CCAT sunfrost refrigerator]]. Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.

The [http://www.sunfrost.com/RF12.html Sun Frost RF12] is a single compressor refrigerator freezer with a passive (no fans) cooling system. For convenience it is typically mounted on a 24" high cabinet. This model is a 110 Volt AC refrigerator.

==Operation==

*The thermostat should be set so that the refrigerator is between the range of 35°F - 44°F. When the refrigerator section is 38°F, the freezer section is 8°F. To locate the temperature control, open the freezer door and look up under the shroud. 

*Avoid keeping the doors open if not needed in order to conserve energy.

*Do not place objects on top of the refrigerator. The condenser and compressor are on top of the refrigerator, and they require maximum air circulation for the refrigerator to function efficiently. They should have at least 6-8" of free air space around them.

*The refrigerator will work optimally if it is regularly maintained. Refer to the maintenance section for information on how to defrost, clean, and assess leaks in the system.
