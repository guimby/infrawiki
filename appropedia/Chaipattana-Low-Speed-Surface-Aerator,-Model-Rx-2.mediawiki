==Abstract==
# Paragraph description of the OSAT - why is it Appropriate? What need does it fulfil? Are there case studies you have found of a technology being used successfully?
# Picture of completed print using your printer [[Image:Wood_WorkingClamp_Parts.png|200px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# Provide a full BOM -- Materials needed for fabrication of device and alternative materials if they are not available, prices/sources of non-printable parts
## Upload and link to all source files from open source CAD
## Upload and link to all STLs
# Nextrox Mini 12V DC 60 RPM High Torque Gear Box Electric Motor

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
#

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* If you used special skill – link to relevant wikipedia or wikiversity articles/courses

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Provide directions for print/assembly - be detailed enough in your “how to” to ensure that someone could construct the device from your description. Consider the elegance of IKEA like instructions.
# Include print time estimate
# Include assembly time estimate
# Including drawings or pictures of the device at stage of assembly at minimum. (http://www.appropedia.org/Special:Upload)
# Consider video if appropriate

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Include common mistakes/problems to avoid in building your OSAT and how to overcome them

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Estimate your costs
# Find a commercial equivalent
# Calculate $ savings and % savings
