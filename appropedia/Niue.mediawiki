2008: Niue is a particpant of the United Nations Environment Programme's Climate Neutral Network. Niue is hoping to become carbon neutral in the near future. Niue's own annual CO2 emissions are approximately 0.003 million metric tonnes for a population of about 1,700. The Government of Niue focuses in particular on the transport and energy sectors as the major contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. It promotes the use of energy saving appliances and compact fluorescent light bulbs, and, in the case of transport, enforces maximum speed limits and encourages carpooling. It also works to cut down carbon emissions through better waste management and harnessing renewable energy resources. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=553&ArticleID=6015&l=en United Nations Environment Programme], December 7 2008</ref>
