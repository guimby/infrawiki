Is it possible to '''go green in an hour'''?

Not completely, but it's possible to make some real changes:
* One hour of doing things like ringing the electricity company & changing to [[green power]].
* Buy a [[composting bin]] or [[worm farm]]. 
* Plan for positive lifestyle changes with an hour's internet research:
** Look up local [[cycling]] routes or [[public transport]], to help reduce or replace your car use.
** Look up local sites and activities, within reach of public transport, a coach ride or a short car ride. You might have overlooked some great local holiday ideas, that could make a lower-carbon (and more affordable) alternative to a jet holiday. (See [[Air travel, climate change, and green consumerism]].)

(This is a response to [[Earth Hour]], and a set of suggestions for future activities related to Earth Hour.)
