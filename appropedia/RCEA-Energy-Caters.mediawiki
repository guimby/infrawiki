[[File:IMG_0586_2.JPG.jpeg|thumb|right|650px|Figure 1: The Final Design-Modeling Renewable Energy]]
During the Spring semester of 2010, a group of four students (Team Energy-Caters) were assigned a twelve week long design project in the [http://www.humboldt.edu/engineering/ Engineering 215 Introduction to Design] course at [http://www.humboldt.edu/ Humboldt State University].  Team Energy-Caters were sponsored by their client [[Redwood Coast Energy Authority]] of Eureka, CA., and given the task to further educate local students on renewable energy in the best-fit design they felt appropriate. The objective and criteria of the design project was developed by team Energy-Caters in order to produce a teaching aid for middle school audience on renewable energy resources. The final product, Modeling Renewable Energy, was researched, constructed, and tested with the goal of being implemented in classrooms for years to come.
==Project Overview==
Modeling Renewable Energy is a design  consisting of a three-part lesson plan. 

The '''first part''' is a written activity for the students. The activity includes informative pamphlets on five renewable energy resources: solar, wind, wave, hydroelectric, and biomass. To go along with the introductory pamphlets is a theoretical scenario describing an area in need of an energy source. The students have a worksheet they complete for this activity.

The '''second part''' is a hands-on activity for the students. One topographic model, as shown in Figure 1, is provided to the class. The students place miniature solar panels, wind mills, and water mills on the model and connect them to a voltmeter to witness them producing energy. There are various spots on the model for the renewable technologies to be placed; each spot changes the amount of energy produced. There is a worksheet involved with this activity.

The '''third part''' is a class debate. The students are split into five groups, each assigned one of the renewable energy resources. The students use the information from the previous activities to develop arguments on why their renewable energy is best-fit for the modeled area. The class debate is structured where each group rotates in presenting until each person in each group has said their argument. 

==Problem and Objective==

The '''total number of combined hours''' that Energy-Caters contributed to completing Modeling Renewable Energy, as seen in Figure 3, is 512 hours. The design process was divided into five phases: Problem Formulation, Problem Analysis/Literature Review, Alternative Solutions, Decision Process, and Construction and Testing of the final solution. Details of each phase are located in the linked document.

The '''estimated annual cost''' to keep Modeling Renewable Energy operational is $112.80. The primary cost comes from making photocopies of the worksheets for the students. This estimate will vary depending on how often the design is implemented in the classroom.
<br>

==Testing Results==
The final solution, Modeling Renewable Energy, is a success in that it meets the objective as an effective and maintainable educational aid regarding renewable energy technologies geared towards middle school students and fits our criteria as a safe, durable, and practice teaching exercise. The final product and lesson plan was not able to best tested in a classroom setting, but was tested on individuals. The individuals were older than the middle school age, but they were able to complete the activities with no instructions, meaning  that middle school students will be able to complete the activities with the help of both written and verbal instructions.
