Christie Walk is an [[eco-housing]] project in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. It is a community project that was built without government support.

Around 45 people live in 27 dwellings. It is a village style environment where it is easier to know one's neigbours. 

There are fewer cars and more space for gardens, and the dwellings themselves are smaller than typical Australian dwellings, but this is compensated by [[shared space]], relationships and a lower [[environmental impact]].
