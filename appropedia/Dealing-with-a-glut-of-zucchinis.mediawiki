When it's zucchini harvest time, and they've grown beautifully in bountiful abundance, one problem can be what to do with a glut of these handy vegetables.

Note: Zucchinis are also referred to by their French term, courgettes.

== Using young zucchini ==
Young zucchini refers to zucchini that is still small and tender, picked before it turns into a giant. There are lots of tasty things to do with the zucchini when harvested at this stage. Here are a few suggestions:

*Add to salads
*Cook in pasta sauce
*Use as the pasta by peeling in thin strands and adding a raw sauce (for the raw foodies)
*Make zucchini soup
*Steam in rounds and serve with other steamed vegetables
*Add to stir fries
*Add thin slices to pizza before baking

== Using large zucchini ==
This refers to the zucchini that gets away when you're not looking and grows into something massive and therefore less tender and rather less appetising. Don't worry, there is plenty you can do with this engorged squash. Here are a few suggestions:

*Make zucchini fritters. Large zucchini are ideal for grating (shredding) and turning into tasty fritters that will feed a large group. Freeze what hasn't been eaten and heat up another day.
*Make zucchini cake. Once again, grate or shred the large zucchini, find a zucchini cake recipe you fancy and bake away. Such cake is suitable for giving to neighbours, friends and bake sales, or for freezing longer term.
*Make zucchini bread. Grate or shred and add to a suitable recipe for bread. 
*Add to casseroles or stews. Cut into cubes and add to the casserole in a decent amount. Can be a great meat substitute for vegetarians.

== Some zucchini recipes ==
Feel free to add your own ideas here. There's no such thing as the one ideal recipe!

=== Zucchini fritters ===
# You'll need:
#*3 cups grated or shredded zucchini
#*2 eggs
#*2 tablespoons plain or all-purpose flour
#*125g feta cheese (optional)
#*A little salt
#*Vegetable oil, for frying.
# Sprinkle salt lightly over the grated zucchini. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse away.
# In a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Add the flour and mix through. Add the zucchini and feta cheese (if using). Stir gently to combine and coat the zucchini with the other ingredients.
# Use a tablespoon to form small mounds from the batter in the frying pan. Fry on each side of the fritter, for about 3 minutes each side. The side is cooked when it has browned slightly.
# Place the fritters on a plate lined with recycled kitchen paper towel to help drain off excess oil. The paper towel can be tossed into the compost when done.
# Serve warm. Serve with a dollop of homemade tomato sauce or yogurt and a fresh salad from your garden or farmer's market produce.
