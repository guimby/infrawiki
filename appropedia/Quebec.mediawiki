=== Towards sustainable economies ===

Worker-owned forestry enterprises in the North, paramedic coops and the sheer number of worker-owners place Québec in the company of other coop strongholds like the Basque region of [[Spain]] and Emilia-Romagna in Northern [[Italy]]. In fact, there are over 7,000 coops and nonprofit businesses in Quebec employing over 150,000 people and generating over $17 billion in sales. <ref>[http://www.shareable.net/blog/montr%C3%A9als-blooming-social-economy-confronts-fiscal-pruning Shareable]</ref>

The definition of Social Economy used by the Chantier de l'économie sociale in Quebec follows:  The Social Economy is made up of association-based economic activities founded on values of: 
* Service to members or the community rather than only generating profits and seeking financial returns;
* Autonomous management (not government controlled);
* Democratic decision making;
* Primacy of persons and work over capital;
* Based on principles of participation, empowerment and individual and collective responsibility.
The Social Economy includes: 
*social assets (housing, childcare centres, etc.) of community organizations; 
*social enterprises including co- operatives and revenue-generating programs of non profit groups; 
*credit unions and social financing organizations like community loan funds; 
*training and skills development enterprises; and 
*sectoral and regional organizations e.g. renewal energy associations. {{W|Social economy#Canada}}
