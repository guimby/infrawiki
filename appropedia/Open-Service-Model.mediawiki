An Open Service Model is a partially or fully community supported environment that provides a service for zero financial cost.

An [[Open Cafe]] is an example of an Open Service Model. Food, drink, furniture, art, equipment, and anything else imagined are donated voluntarily by the community to create and actively participate in an open social environment.
