== Introduction ==

GTP, or Generalized ToolPath language, is a programming language designed for the purpose of controlling digital fabrication tools with human-readable syntax. [[User:Spm|Sm√°ri McCarthy]] is the primary language author with significant inputs from David Dalrymple.

== Specification ==

The language specification is still under construction. See [[GTP/Specification]] for the current draft.

== Usages ==

GTP is being used as an internal representation format for [[Kokompe]], an open source CAM/CAD project.
GTP is also being used as the native language of the [[Callooh]] CNC mill, with [[User:Mchua|Mel Chua]] slated to write a GTP interpreter once specifications settle down.
