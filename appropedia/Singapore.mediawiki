'''Singapore''' is a densely populated island city [[South-East Asia]] which stands out in its region for its approaches to [[transport]] and [[urban planning]], and resulting clean air, and cool and pleasant environment.

High-rise development across the island has been used as a way to conserve the space taken up by housing, and increase the area covered by trees and plants. The effect of this on reducing the [[Urban Heat Island]] effect is very noticeable, compared to other cities in the region. In recent years [[flowers]] have been planted in many areas of public space and alongside roads.

The [[public transport]] system is extensive, efficient, and affordable and cars are discouraged through very high [[taxes]]. Thus the [[incentive]] structure is such to minimize traffic jams in spite of the wealth of the city, and result in heavily utilized public transport.
