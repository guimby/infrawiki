==Introduction==

'''Green computing''', or [[green information technology]] ([[IT]]), refers to environmentally sustainable computing. It is the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently by designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated [[subsystems]] (such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and [[networking]] and [[communication systems]]) with minimal or no impact on the environment. <!-- May want to revise as sentence comes across as wordy --> Green computing strives for economic practicality and improved system performance while satisfying social and ethical responsibilities. Green computing includes the dimensions of [[environmental sustainability]], [[energy efficiency]] [[economics]], and total cost of ownership (which includes the cost of disposals and [[recycling]])."<ref name="San Murugesan 2008, pp 24-33">San Murugesan, “Harnessing Green IT: Principles and Practices,” IEEE ''IT Professional'', January-February 2008, pp 24-33.</ref> <!--If this is a quote please place quotation mark at beginning; otherwise, please delete-->


Green computing can be made more sustainable in several ways including:

*Placing the computer in [[hibernation mode]]<!-- May want to expand on what hibernating is --> 
*Switching the computer screen off instead of using [[screensavers]] 
*Turning the computer off when it is not in use 

Each of these examples can save power. More efficient coding means computers use less power and need less powerful hardware.

== Energy-efficient computers==

The maker of the low cost [[Inveneo]] computer claims to use one-sixth as much [[electricity]] as a typical personal computer.[http://www.tectonic.co.za/wordpress/?p=1450]<!-- I would expand on this and state how they use less electricity than a typical PC -->


== Energy Efficient IT Architecture ==

Using low power disk-less thin clients can save considerable power.

One way of doing that with Open Source Software is to use the [http://www.ltsp.org/ Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP)] Software. 

In their own words "LTSP is an add-on package for Linux that allows you to connect lots of low-powered thin-client terminals to a Linux server. Applications typically run on the server, and accept input and display their output on the thin-client display

10x Desktop computers can use up to 1000watts (100 watts each)

1x LTSP server & 10 thin clients can use less than 500 watts.

One report shows that 12 clients + server consumed [http://www.bristolwireless.net/2006/09/were-all-ltsping-on-our-summer-holidays/ less than 480 watts] 

More [http://articles.adelayde.net/hesfes05/ technical details] on a LTSP set up 

On a Ubuntu box: $sudo apt-get install ltsp-manager ltsp-server-standalone

==Recycling facts==<!-- I would expand and let the reader know more about what they can do to improve their recycling efforts -->  <!--Please write an introductory sentence for this list or place the items in paragraph form instead of a bulleted list-->
*Computer [[motherboards]] contain [[heavy metals]] and should not be disposed of with ordinary garbage. 

*Recycling of computers in countries, like China, can lead to serious health problems due to inadequate safety measures in handling [[toxic waste]] components.

*Companies that recycle computers and electronic goods include [[SIMS (A scrap metals company that has diversified)]]. and [http://www.computer-recycling-and-removals.co.uk Computer Recycling] Environmental Computer Recycling

== Notes and references ==
{{reflist}}
Other companies use the internet to facilitate direct sale of computers for re use by a second user, for example, http://www.sellmylaptopuk.co.uk/ and http://www.computer-recycling-and-removals.co.uk/refurbished-used-computers-laptops.htm This results from the rapid turnover of technology development where items are replaced by newer technology before they reach the end of their useful lives.
