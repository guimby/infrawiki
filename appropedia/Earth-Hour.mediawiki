Every year on the last Saturday of the month of March, the lights go out in many cities not because of a power outage in the city, but because the citizens of that city decided to shut down the light for an hour. This hour is known as Earth Hour; which was an idea started in Australia to bring awareness to climate change. This idea became global, and now is reaching across many countries showing people that the smallest things came make a difference.
