'''Bog gardens''' are a type of shallow pond garden, in which an area is permanently covered in a thin layer of water. It is ideal for an area of the garden that has poor drainage or it can be created from scratch by making a shallow type of pool.

Plants grown in a bog garden must be those that thrive having constantly wet roots and lower stems/leaves. It should also be situated in an area where it will not create an insect nuisance, such as near a house, windows/doors or play and leisure areas, as bog gardens attract flies, mosquitoes, gnats, midges, etc. However, provided the bog garden is carefully planted and situated, these insects and their larvae will instantly become a meal for amphibians, newts, birds and bats that frequent your garden. It will attract damsel flies, dragonflies and other lovely insects too, making for nice viewing and photo opportunities.

Bog gardens tend to be suitable for cool to mild temperate climate zones, many natural bogs are alpine, sub-alpine or cool climate, thus the plants suited to such gardens reflect the cooler temperature needs. The bog garden may not do well in a hot environment, if it risks attracting disease-carrying mosquitoes, in which case it would not be a desirable addition to a garden space unless well managed. If that is not an issue, base such a bog garden on tropical or sub-tropical plants suited to a watery growing environment.

== Making a bog garden ==

Decide where to situate the garden. It could be in an area of the garden or yard with poor drainage or perhaps alongside an existing pond or body of water.

If the area is without a watery surface, create one by building a shallow pond. This pond should only be about 20cm deep at most. If the soil is especially heavy, place gravel onto the pond liner, to aid drainage, and be to poke holes in the liner. Finish with a layer of soil over the top, then add the water.

== Plants suitable for bog gardens ==

Choose plants that grow in a water environment naturally. Here are some suggested plants:

*Butterworts (''Pinguicula'')
*Bladderworts (''Utricularia'')
*Pennyroyal (''Mentha pulegium'')
*Meadowsweet (''Filpendula ulmaria'')
*Marshmallow (''Althaea officinalis'')
*Teasel (''Dipsacus fullonum'')
*Ragged robin (''Lychnis flos-culculi'')
*Hemp agrimony (''Eupatorium cannbinum'')
*North American pitcher plants (''Sarracenia'')
*Lady's smock (''Cadamine pratensis'')
