Hot Water Solar Repair Supervisor: Ben Scurfield 

This [[solar hot water]] system was one of the first in Humboldt County. This system is over 30 years old and part of Arcataâ€™s pilot program for [[renewable energy]] systems. It had a slow leak from both of the dribble valves which are necessary for an open looped system. The advantage of and open looped system is added efficiency from not having a heat exchanger. The old valves were replaced after draining the collectors into a bucket from the drain outlet shown in the next picture. After being drained we replaced the dribble valves with minimum leakage and the problem was resolved.
