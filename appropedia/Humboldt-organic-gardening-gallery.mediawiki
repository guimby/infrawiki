===Organic Gardening in confined space===
*'''Description:''' Organic garden in front of an apartment for fruits and veggies
*'''Justification:''' This person does not have a yard at all to grow anything in. Instead of growing useless landscaping shrubs, this person has decided to make use of the small, sunny plot in front of his/her apartment to grow veggies. It is about as local as one can get with produce, reducing the dependence on oil.
*'''Issues:''' The nutrients and organic fertilizer that are added to the soil are brought from elsewhere. The deck above this garden is made of pressure treated wood, making the runoff questionable for health. This garden is not big enough for self-subsistence.
*'''Location:''' L K Wood Blvd, Arcata
