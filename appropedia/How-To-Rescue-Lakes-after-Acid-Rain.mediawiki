I found no clear solutions for the acid rain (and snow) problem: how to prevent dying off of flora and fauna in contaminated lakes. The contamination (mostly by H2SO4, HNO3) comes more from groundwater after such a rain than from the rain directly. So we have some time to prepare and to react. But how? Other question - is it possible to take some measures without using expensive chemicals?
Maybe someone could bring some useful information to this page. Thanks.
