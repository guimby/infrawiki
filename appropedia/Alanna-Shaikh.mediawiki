One of her blogs, ''[http://bloodandmilk.org/ Blood and Milk]'', uses an [[open license]],<ref>[http://bloodandmilk.org/?p=6 ''Blood and Milk'' license statement]</ref> and as a result many pages on [[Appropedia]] have been created using this content,<ref>[http://www.appropedia.org/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&target=Template%3AAttrib+bloodandmilk&namespace=0 Pages on Appropedia using content from ''Blood and Milk'']. There is also [[How to start a successful NGO]] which doesn't appear on the list for technical reasons (nothing important - it just doesn't use the same template notice).</ref> especially in the [[:Category:Principles of development|Principles of development category]]. These pages include:
* [[Honesty as policy in aid and development]]
* [[Monitoring and evaluation]]
