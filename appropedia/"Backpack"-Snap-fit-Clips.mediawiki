==Abstract==
This type of clip is found on a variety of items, most commonly backpacks, and work well. However, I have found that if you break one, it is difficult to find a replacement, and are overpriced (typically $2-6 for 1 set!). Since it is made of plastic and only plastic, I wanted to make a parametric OpenSCAD design. There are many designs for there out already, however few provided source code and even fewer were scalable.
