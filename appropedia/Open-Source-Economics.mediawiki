'''Open Source Economics''' (OSE) is an attempt to extend the [[Open Source]] model to the provision of [[goods]] and [[services]]. This means opening access to information and technology to enable a different economic system to be realized, one based on natural ecology, social ecology, [[industrial ecology]] and [[open access]] - based on widely accessible [[information]] and associated access to productive capital - distributed into the hands of an increased number of people. 

On the [http://ose.noblogs.org/post/2003/06/01/our-mission Open Source Economics website] is an inspiring example of such an economic model currently put into practice in manufacturing vehicles.

This a highly distributed, increasingly participatory model of production could support a democratic society, where stability is established naturally by the balance of human activity with sustainable extraction of [[natural resources]]. This contrasts with mainstream centralized economies, which have a structurally built-in tendency towards of overproduction.{{fact}}{{expand}}
