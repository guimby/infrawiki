==Specific technology==
A server is a computer dedicated to running sophisticated programs which require a substantial amount of memory and computing power. Servers are connected to a network, and other computers linked to the network can access the server to run those programs. In addition, they are also used to store information which can be accessed by other computers linked to the network.  It is common practice for individual server machines to be dedicated to running a single program or task, ensuring sufficient resource availability while eliminating competition for resources between programs or tasks running on a single physical server, and simplifying troubleshooting processes. Servers often possess more power than necessary for running one specific program or task and it is not uncommon for their computing potential to be underused.  Server virtualization, in basic terms, is a method of using this untapped potential by running multiple server programs on one physical server. This is accomplished by 'tricking' one physical server into acting as multiple servers, so that there can be no unwanted interaction between programs running on the same physical server.  This calculator allows you to explore the potential savings that would result from server virtualization for your organization.

==ECM Inputs==
The following inputs are required for this calculation:
*Number of unvirtualized (physical) server currently in use
*Physical space occupied by each server (square-metres)
*Number of servers added or provisioned annually
*Consolidation ratio for virtualization
General values for the following variables are provided with references, but if your organization has specific data more accurate for your particular case, this data should be updated with your data.
*Cost of physical servers
*Cost of software license, both initial and renewal, for both physical and virtual servers
*Wage of IT personnel
*Estimations of labour and maintenance hours required annually
*Estimates of installation and provisioning costs.
For more information, refer to the assumptions and references tab in the document.

==ECM Assumptions==
This calculator is built on a few assumptions, the most significant of which would be the cost of various components or features and time required for installation and maintenance of the related equipment. Value for these variables are provided by default with references to their origin, but can - and should, when possible - be updated to match and information you have specifically for your organization. For details on the ROI calculation see the [[Talk:Network_server_virtualization| Discussion page]]
