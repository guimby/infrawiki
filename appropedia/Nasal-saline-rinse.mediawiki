==Problem==
Exposure to airborne irritants and allergens leading to allergic rhinitis (hayfever) can be relieved with a nasal rinse of saline solution. Availability and cost of commercially prepared saline solutions may limit accessibilty to treatment.

==Summary==
A homemade recipe of boiled water, salt, and baking soda is made for irrigation of the nasal mucous membranes.

==Instructions==

''(Also available by [[Media:Nasal Saline Rinse Instructions.doc|download]] as a patient handout.)''

Nasal saline (salt water) rinses can help allergies and sinus infections by:
:Thinning secretions
:Removing pollen, dust and other allergens from your nose
:Removing secretions to make surfaces in your nose available for nasal steroid sprays

To make your own saline rinse, mix together in a clean container:
:Â¼ teaspoon salt, 
:1 cup warm water
:1 pinch baking soda

Remember:
:If possible, use a non-iodized salt such as sea salt
:If needed, adjust the amount of salt so that it tastes as salty as tears
:Make a new batch every 24 hours
:Use the saline rinse at least 15 minutes before using nasal steroid sprays
:Use a clean dropper bottle to put drops in nose
:You can also clean your hands, pour a small amount into your palm and snort the solution into your nose
