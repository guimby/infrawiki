== Unsafe bench vice tool  ==

Millions of poorly designed bench vice tools are sold all over the world. 

Problem 1: If people turn the handle, their fingers can get trapped between the handle and the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_vice movable claw part]]. The distance between the handle and movable claw part must be greater than the thickness of an adult human finger. 

Problem 2: If people open the movable claw part all the way out, it can fall out, causing injury due to its weight.
