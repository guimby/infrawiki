==Abstract==
The objective of this project was to design a metering scheme that would monitor the amount of energy used by the visitors staying at the Samoa hostel.  The purpose of this was to show visitors the impact of their choices when they leave a device such as a cell phone charger plugged into an outlet.  This is done by placing energy meters within every room of the Samoa hostel.  However, most energy meters measure energy usage for a whole household.  To meet this observation, we developed a design called the Watt-imus Prime which is able to measure electric flow from multiple circuits and display how much energy is used from one circuit or all of them simultaneously.   

==Background==
The Samoa Hostel intends to educate visitors about topics related to ecology and conservation.  Part of this is an effort to allow visitors to monitor how much energy they are using, including electricity consumed by appliances that are left plugged into an outlet.  Studies have shown that self-monitoring of energy usage cuts consumption by a significant degree.  Our solution's purpose is to find a meter to be placed into each of the twenty-four rooms of the Samoa hostel.  Most energy monitors on the market only measure the energy usage for an entire building or household.  Therefore, we kept a few constraints in mind as we thought of a metering scheme that met the client's wants:   

===Constraints===
*Each room in the Samoa hostel is to have one meter. 
*The location of the meter is at eye-level (around five feet). 
*The meter must have an easy to read LCD screen. 
*The meter is easy for anyone to operate. 
*The meter must be able to  measure up to 220V. 
*The meters must not interfere with each other. 

==Problem Statement==
The Metering scheme for the Samoa hostel must have an energy meter in every room that is easy to see, operate, and show people the amount of energy used when leaving a device left into an outlet.  Yet most meters only measure energy usage for an entire building, or are restricted to outlets.  To meet this problem, we developed a list of criteria in descending order of importance:

===Criteria===  
# '''Safety''' The design must meet the National Electric Code.
# '''Education''' The design must show people the impact of their choices and encourage conservation.
# '''Durability''' The design must be able to withstand everyday use.
# '''Cost''' should be less than $250.00.
# '''Aesthetics''' The design should look professional.

==Final solution: The Watt-imus Prime==
The metering scheme will use the EM-2500 meter as a means of measuring the Kilowatts of both the circuit for the light and outlet.  For our final project, the Watt-imus Prime simulates a wall of one of the rooms in the hostel.  According to National Electric Code, the the circuits for the light and outlet must be separate.  The EM-2500 uses either a solid core or split core current transformer (CT's) that surround the insulated wire and detects the magnetic field around the wire.  The meter comes with two CT's that plug into it on separate channels.  The electric flow in each channel can be measured separately or all together as a means to show the total amount of energy being used.  For the Samoa hostel, the EM-2500 will be wall-mounted to around 5 feet so visitors will be able to view it easily.  It is also able to display the energy in different measurements  for the visitors to understand the impact of the leaving the light on or plugged in device.

==Testing Results==
Upon construction of the Wattimus Prime, HID determined that a wooden block needed to be placed behind the receptacle box to provide it stability, and that a board needed to be placed behind the backplate to prevent the model from rocking backwards. The Watt-imus Prime was able to measure real power flow from each circuit separately and simultaneously.  It was able to show that a 13 Watt light bulb used that many Watts.  When a Macbook was plugged into of the the outlets, the kilowatts were .048 and increased to 0.074.  The design was also able to to read the total power flow within the whole model.
