'''Green building''' is the practice of increasing the [[efficiency]] with which buildings use resources — [[energy efficiency|energy]], [[water conservation|water]], and [[materials]] — while reducing building impacts on human [[health]] and the [[environment]], through better siting, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and removal — the complete building [[life cycle]]. 

A green building minimizes impact on the environment through resource conservation in the choice of materials, construction methods, and ongoing consumption. Avoiding artificial compounds and managing [[ventilation]] can also contribute to the health of its occupants. 

Perhaps the least obvious benefit, yet an extremely important one, is comfort. By reducing the need for air conditioning and heating, and by using natural light, natural materials and natural ventilation, green buildings tend to be aesthetically pleasing, texturally rich, fresh and pleasing environments, 

Implementing a [[building management system]], a of computer networking of all energy-related mechanisms of the building, can greatly decrease the need for all forms of energy{{fact}} and improve comfort. This is the concept of the "[[intelligent building]]".

== Certification ==

=== Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ===

'''LEED''', ('''[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]'''), is a green certification system used in the [[United States]], with different levels of certification for green buildings based on different criteria and total credits and points earned.  

Credits are given based on:
*[[Sustainable sites]]
*[[Water efficiency]]
*[[Energy]] and [[atmosphere]]
*Materials and resources
*[[Indoor environmental quality]]
*Innovation and design process
Different certification levels are based on the amount of points a building receives for successful attempts at the six categories.
