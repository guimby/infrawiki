CCAT Monitor installation on Harpst St, Arcata Supervisor: Ben Scurfield 

I participated in the installation of a paramonitoring system and thermal intake and outtake monitoring system on the HSU campus. A paramonitor measures collectorâ€™s watts per square meter. The intake and outtake collectors measure the water temperature coming in and out of the collector. This is an outline of the photovoltaic system:
