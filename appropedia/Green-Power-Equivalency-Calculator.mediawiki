==Green Power  Equivalency Calculator==

[[EPA]] developed the [http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/pubs/calculator.htm Green Power Equivalency Calculator] to help better communicate their [[green power]] purchase to interested stakeholders. The calculator translates kilowatt-hours purchased into more understandable terms, such as an equivalent number of passenger vehicles, homes, or coal plants.

 

The equivalency calculations for passenger vehicles per year, gallons of gasoline consumed, propane cylinders used for home barbeques, coal-fired power plant emissions for one year, and home electricity use for one year were updated in the calculator to reflect newer data.
It does the calculation for different regions in the U.S.A.
