A meadow is a grassy area of land that may be an agricultural field or a wild area that is self-sown.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadow</ref> Meadows contain grasses, non-woody plants, wildflowers, weed plants, etc.<ref name="wp" />

A meadow is not a technical term but more of a cultural term.<ref name="nps" /> It is a type of ecosystem that is made up of community of a plant or plants reliant on surface water (or shallow ground water) and has mostly herbaceous species (grass), with some woody vegetation such as trees and shrubs.<ref name="nps" />

An agricultural meadow is not grazed heavily, or at all, but is allowed to develop its grassland.<ref name="wp" /> This grass can then be turned into hay for livestock.

== Meadow ecology ==
The ecology of meadows is complex.<ref name="nps">http://www.nps.gov/yose/learn/nature/meadows.htm</ref> They are ecologically important because they support a wide range of flora and fauna attracted by the sunny and open area a meadow provides.<ref name="wp" /> The pollinating potential is high, due to the production of wildflowers, attracting bees and other pollinating insects and perhaps some mammals.

Wildflower meadows are important for biodiversity.<ref name="uk">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/urgc-7edjrg</ref> Urban meadows can provide open areas that encourage various species to use the area, provide colour in the urban areas and serve as a focal point for the community to actively manage and care for nature within the urban setting.<ref name="uk" />

Meadows play an important role in soaking up water when the snowpack melts in areas subject to snow.<ref name="nps" />
