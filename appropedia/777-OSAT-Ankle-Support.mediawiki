# Preferred filament (PLA Intended)
# 2 Metal / Plastic / Wood pins, ~1.6 mm diameter, one of them ~8 mm length, the other ~16 mm length
# Elastic Cloth, Shoelaces, or small twine

== Tools needed for fabrication==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Tools to smooth and refine prints (deburring tool, sandpaper)

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Knowledge of using 3D Printers

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Mount and insert the pegs on the top of part 'B' into the holes on the top of part 'D'
# Place one of the holes of part 'A' in between hinge assembly on bottom of part 'C'; insert a pin to stabilize
# place large outer disks of part 'D' into the shafts of part 'C', ensuring the top of the parts shown in the image remain on the same side
# Place other hole of part 'A' into one of the holes in the center of part 'B'.
# Place onto user and insert shoelaces through small holes across parts 'C' and 'D'; tie shoelaces to fit user.
# 4 hour print total, assuming 60 mm/s print speed and 40% infill.
# ~20 minutes to assemble
=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Slots of parts 'B' and 'D' may not fit well; sand and smooth parts as needed.

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# ~ 80 grams to print at defined settings. Assuming $30/kg of filament, as well as the purchase of pins [http://www.globalindustrial.com/p/metalworking-tools/metalworking-drills/drill-reamer-blanks/made-in-usa-jobbers-length-drill-blank-metric-1-6mm?infoParam.campaignId=T9F&gclid=CManv7ykzMkCFQIPaQodohkKHA here], cost will be '''~$6.20''' for entire product.
