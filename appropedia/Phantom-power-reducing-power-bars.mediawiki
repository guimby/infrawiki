==Introduction==
Phantom power is the power consumed by electrical appliances when they are switched off or not in use, but remain plugged in to an electrical socket. It is also known as standby power, the minimum amount of power required by an electrical device while plugged in.  Although the phantom power consumption of one individual appliance may be trivial, many appliances within a home or business draw power when not in use, and this power consumption can accumulate.   Another reference to phantom power is standby power or vampire power, this can be thought of as a leaky faucet and can account for a total of 10% of the energy costs for a residential home.  The following articles provide a comprehensive background on phantom power, its effects, and how it can be mitigated.

===Example===
A medium-sized business has twenty cubicles, each equipped with an LCD monitor, computer, phone, and printer. These devices use a combined standby power draw of 20.56 watts for an average of 2.63 kWh per week (assuming 8 hour workdays from Monday to Friday). At an average power cost of 7 cents per kWh, this results in a cost of $9.61 per year per cubicle. Replacing all of the current power bars with energy-saving bars (with a cost of approximately $40 each) would result in a payback time of 4.16 years.<br/>

===Overview Articles===

====[http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tech-transport/penny-pinching-save-energy-by.html Saving Energy by Avoiding Phantom Power] <ref name=“dunn”> ''Dunn, Colin. “Saving Energy by Avoiding Phantom Power”. Planet Green. March 23, 2008.''</ref>====
A brief introduction to phantom power, this article stems from an eco-lifestyle television network called Planet Green.  Born in 2008, Planet Green is present both on television and online, and exists to provide information to a broad range of individuals regarding ways to improve the environmental status of our planet.  The article covers an introduction to what phantom power is, and why it is necessary to attempt to reduce its consumption.

====[http://www.clean.energy.wa.gov.au/pages/standby_power.asp Standby Power – Addressed in Australia] <ref name=“Australia”> ''Government of Western Australia. “Standby Power”. Office of Energy.  February 2, 2009.''</ref>====
Australia is one of the world leaders in addressing phantom power issues, and therefore this source was found to determine what some potential solution paths are.  Australia addressed phantom power issues for the first time in 2002, and since then they have been working with industries to help reduce the phantom power consumption of appliances.  However, since many of the appliances used in Australia are produced overseas (and therefore are not manufactured to keep phantom power consumption to a minimum), the Office of Energy in the Australian government addresses the fact that if an individual does not want to unplug each of their appliances, there are power bars available that can help reduce phantom power consumption.

====[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/technologies/buying_low_standby.html How to Buy Products with Low Standby Power] <ref name=“usdoe”> ''US Department of Energy. “How to Buy Products with Low Standby Power”. Federal Energy Management Program.  July 14, 2009. ’’</ref>====
The United States Department of Energy has recognized phantom power consumption to be a significant issue, and has therefore created a policy stating that on a federal level, appliances purchased must comply with certain phantom power regulations.  This source shows that on a large scale especially, phantom power consumption is a problem that needs to be addressed.

This source further shows the importance of reducing phantom power consumption.  Although it is not a government regulated site or a scholarly article, it is a forum for environmentally-minded individuals to post their advice for being more sustainable.  This article focuses on phantom power consumption and the importance of its reduction, and is accompanied by a list of methods by which to reduce phantom power consumption in households.

===Phantom Power Data===

====[http://standby.lbl.gov/summary-table.html Phantom Power Consumption of Common Household Appliances] <ref name=“meier”> ''Meier, Alan. “Standby Power Summary Table”. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  2009.''</ref>====
In a study done by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, many household and business appliances were measured to determine their phantom power consumption.  A total of 58 different types of appliances were tested, and for each type of appliance, anywhere from 1 to 64 actual products were measured.  The data gathered involves the average phantom power consumption, along with the maximum and minimum.  This was an unbiased study carried out to demonstrate how much could be saved by eliminating the phantom power consumption of different appliances in your home or business.  Although not completely precise due to the averaging of values, and the lack of specification between models of appliances, the study provides a rough estimation of how much phantom power is consumed by each appliance.  The study also draws the conclusion that nearly 10% of home electricity use is a direct result of phantom power.

====[http://www.energyrating.gov.au/standbydata/app/Default.aspx International Standby Data Project] <ref name=“project”> ''Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate Change. “International Standby Power Data Project”. Asia Pacific Partnership.  2009.''</ref>====
The purpose of the International Standby Power Data Project is to collect data on standby power from seven different countries in order to facilitate international comparisons and draw trends in standby consumption.  By setting standards for the collection of this data, these countries were able to collaborate in order to determine in-depth issues regarding phantom power consumption.  The project was initiated as part of the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate Change, and includes Australia, Canada, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, and the United States of America.  The information is represented graphically in the above link, demonstrating the distribution of devices within a certain category of appliances.
