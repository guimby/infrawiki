This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for [[CCAT yurt]]. Please refer to it regularly and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.

The operation of the CCAT yurt is straightforward when all components have been well maintained. There is little that needs to be done in order for the retaining wall, roof, and Liter-of-Lights to operate. However, the photovoltaic system does require some further explanation.

;PV System
*The LED lights powered by the PV system and can be turned on and off using the switches on the side of the power center box that houses the inverter, charge controller, and spare fuses.
*The option to plug in AC loads, however, is more complex. First, the loads must be plugged into the inverter, and then the inverter must be turned on. Be sure to turn off the inverter when loads are not in use. Finally, users must understand that AC power is limited, and may be completely unavailable during the darkest three months of the year.

== Maintenance ==
To ensure the yurt lives a long productive life, regular maintenance of its different components is essential.

=== Schedule ===
<!-- Please keep the format the same as it populates the kiosk in CCAT. -->

;Daily
*Check state-of-charge reading on charge controller monitor

;Weekly
*Clean solar panel
*Inspect power center box for corrosion, debris, or loose/exposed wires

;Monthly
*Check electrolyte levels of battery (Eye and Hand Protection Required)
*Inspect battery terminals for corrosion, debris, or loose/exposed wires
*Clean/dust Liter-of-Light bottles

;Every 3 months
*Equalize battery
*Inspect retaining wall for weeds, debris, and weakened or damaged structures, especially after heavy rains 
*Inspect roof for loose or rusty shingles
*Inspect Liter-of-Light flashings for leaks

;Yearly
*Conduct IV curve to assess health of PV panel

;Every 5 years
*Replace the water/bleach solution in the Liter-of-Light bottles

=== Instructions ===
Below are instructions from manuals regarding the maintenance of different CCAT yurt projects. Those regarding the CCAT  yurt roof were developed in the [[SALIRAJA Yurt Project]] and those describing the PV system were adopted from the 2006 Humboldt State University ENGR 535 class CCAT Yurt Solar PV System Users Manual.

 |title=How to Replace Loose or Rusty Shingles
 |File:Rustyshingle.jpg |Rusty Shingle |1 |  Identify loose or rusty shingle 
 |File:Crowbar_wiki.jpg |Flickr crowbar |2 | Remove rusty single using small crowbar or similar lever
 |File:Somanycans.jpg | Cut cans |3 | Scrub the rust off with steel wool. Or, if beyond repair, cut a clean tin can using tin snips and flatten
 |File:Bender.jpg | Bend cans |5 | Use pliers to bend the edges of the cans so they are less dangerous to work with 
 |File:Sami spraying cans.jpg| Spraying Cans |6 | Spray cans with rust resistant paint (Eye and respiratory protection required)
|File:staple-gun.jpg| Attach Fresh Shingle |7 | After drying, attach the refreshed shingle using a staple gun

{{How to
 |title=How to Conduct an IV Curve on the CCAT Yurt's PV Panel (Proper training required)
 |File:Batterydisconnect.jpg |Deep cycle battery |1 |  Disconnect the battery 
 |File:Pvpanel_leads.jpg |Back of PV Panel |2 | Disconnect the leads from the back of the panel 
 |File:mutimeter volate.jpg | Multimeter Diagram |3 | Test the open circuit voltage (Voc) by setting the multimeter to test DC Voltage (don’t forget to check the placement of the cables) and then holding the probes across the input and output terminals of the panel
'''Step 4 : '''Test the short circuit current (Isc) by setting the multimeter to test DC current, and again hold the probes across the terminals
 |File:Wood-clipboard.jpg| Record Values |5 |  Record the readings for each panel and the ambient conditions (time, cloud cover, wind) in the comments section of the maintenance log. If the panels vary by more than 20% in either voltage or current, contact a solar technician
 |File:Blue_sky1.jpg| No Clouds |6 | The readings should be taken as quickly as possible for minimizing the effect of the outside conditions and angle of the incoming sunlight.  Ideally, readings will be taken on a day with either no cloud cover, or no moving clouds so that the available solar radiation stays constant

 |title=How to Conduct Specific Gravity Measurements on CCAT Yurt's Deep-Cycle Battery (Proper training required)
 |File:Batterydisconnect.jpg |Deep cycle battery |1 |  Disconnect the battery 
 |File:batterybox.jpg |Hydrometer |2 |  Clean off specific gravity hydrometer to ensure no foreign material could be introduced into the battery (Eye protection required)
'''Step 3 :''' Open battery box and ensure door is secure.

'''Step 4 :''' Open left-most cell door
 |File:our_hydrometer.jpg | Hydrometer  |5 |  Depress hydrometer ball.
Note: Never depress ball while hydrometer tube is in battery cell!  

'''Step 6 :''' Insert hydrometer tube into the cell completely and release
 |File:Wood-clipboard.jpg|Record Values |7 | Note and record the level of the hydrometer float in the tube.
'''Step 8:'''  Record fluid level of cell
 |File:x6.jpg|  |9 | Repeat for all cells
 |File:DI.jpg|DI Water |10 | With the help of the funnel add distilled water to any cell below the full line (approx. ¼ to ½ inch below bottom of battery vent) on the battery
 |File:Batterybox.jpg|Battery Cell |11 | Ensure all cell doors are securely closed
'''Step 12 :''' Close battery box

'''Step 13 :''' Perform battery equalization if specific gravity of any of the cells varies from the mean by 0.025 or greater
 |File:hydrometeralone.jpg|Hydrometer |14 |Rinse the hydrometer thoroughly and return to hydrometer holder. The
hydrometer holder should also be removed occasionally and rinsed to prevent corrosion

{{How to
 |title=How to Conduct a Battery Equalization on CCAT Yurt's Deep-Cycle Battery (Proper training required)
 |File:Batteryboxlid.jpg |Battery box and power center box |1 |  Lift the lid of the battery box (the section of the bench)
 |File:Batterydisconnect.jpg |Hydrometer |2 |  Disconnect the battery from the system by turning the switch off within the battery box.
 |File:Batterynegpos.jpg | Deep cycle battery |3 | Identify positive (red) and negative (black) battery terminals
 |File:battery_charger_SERC.jpg| Battery charger |4 |Connect corresponding positive (red) and negative (black) clips of battery charger to charging tabs
'''Step 5 :'''  Plug in and turn on battery charger
 |File:chargecontrollerdisplay.jpg | Battery Display  |6 | Monitor battery display every hour
'''Step 7 :'''  Note time when display shows battery is full
 |File:wall_clock.jpg|Time |8 | Battery should be allowed to remain charging at a low current (approx. 5% of battery’s 20 hr capacity in amps) for 1-2 hours after it is full
Caution: Leave yurt door open for maximum ventilation. If battery becomes heated over 125°F, the battery should be disconnected and equalization continued after battery cools.
 |File:our_hydrometer.jpg| |9 | If two specific gravity readings taken within ½ hour are equal, equalization is complete
 |File:battery_charger_SERC.jpg|DI Water |10 | Turn off and unplug battery charger
 |File:Batterynegpos.jpg|Battery Cell |11 | Disconnect clips from battery terminals
 |File:Wood-clipboard.jpg|Equalization |12 | Record date of equalization and specific gravity measurements of each cell before and after equalization

== Suggestions for future changes ==
Implementation of a CCAT yurt sign up sheet will help to maximize the yurt's potential as a gathering space and make it more accessible to different groups. The sign up sheet could be held by a CCAT co-director, or tacked near the door outside of the yurt.
