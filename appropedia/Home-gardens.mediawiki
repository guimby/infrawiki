'''Home gardens''' are a type of forest gardens found in humid areas. They use [[intercropping]] to cultivate [[tree]]s, [[crops]], and [[livestock]] on the same land. In [[Kerala]] in South [[India]] as well as in northeastern India, they are the most common form of land use; they are also found in [[Indonesia]]. One example combines [[coconut]], [[black pepper]], [[cocoa]] and [[pineapple]]. 

These gardens exemplify [[polyculture]], and conserve much crop [[genetic diversity]] and [[heirloom plant]]s that are not found in [[monocultures]]. There are now efforts to apply a similar concept in temperate climates ([[forest gardening]]).
