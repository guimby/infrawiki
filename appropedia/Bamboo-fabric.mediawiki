'''Bamboo fabric''' is the material made from the bamboo plant. The fabric is made from the pulp of bamboo grass. It's a versatile, soft and long-wearing fabric. As a fabric, bamboo is sustainable from its growth and harvesting through to using and disposing of it.

== Sustainability of bamboo ==
Bamboo is the largest member of the grass family and is considered to be the fastest growing woody plant in the world. It can thrive in a diversity of climates, with much of it being grown in Asia. This fast growth rate of bamboo and its ability to grow in many different areas and climates makes it a sustainable product, harvested quickly and easily replaced. It has enormous versatility when used for the textile industry.

Growth of bamboo minimises carbon dioxide emissions and generates more oxygen than a stand of trees. In addition, bamboo can help prevent soil erosion (it is not uprooted when harvested), helps to slow deforestation (as an alternative source of timber or in place of cotton) and, in general, can be grown without irrigation, thereby saving water.

At the end of its fabric cycle, bamboo fibers are biodegradable. You can even toss bamboo clothing into the compost bin (with the obvious rider that care needs to be taken concerning dyes and embellishments on the clothing).

== Bamboo species used for clothing ==
The variety of bamboo used for clothing is usually the Moso bamboo. This bamboo is the main bamboo in China, covering about 3 million hectares.

== Care of bamboo fabric ==
Bamboo fabric is easy to care for. It can be hand- or machine-washed. While it is more eco-friendly to air dry it, bamboo clothing can be tumble dried if necessary. However, to prevent wrinkling, take it out of the dryer while still slightly damp and let it air dry the rest of the way.

Shrinkage will be minimal when washing.

When ironing bamboo fabric, use steam and medium heat.
