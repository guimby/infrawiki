In 2007, Forbes.com rated Maryland as the fifth "Greenest" state in the country behind three of the Pacific States and [[Vermont]]. Maryland ranks 40th in total energy consumption nationwide, and it managed less toxic waste per capita than all but six states in 2005. In April 2007 Maryland joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—a regional initiative formed by all of the Northeastern states, [[Washington DC]], and three Canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>[[wikipedia:Maryland#Environmental awareness]]</ref>
