==Problem being addressed==
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality. PPH, characterized as greater than 500 mL of blood lost in 24 hours, contributes to a large portion of the worldâ€™s 340,000 maternal deaths each year. 

==Detailed description of the solution==
The device is a compact battery-powered device that generates electrical signals to respond to conditions uterine atony (i.e. loss of strength of the uterus).  Electrodes are placed inside the uterus, vagina or cervix to cause postpartum contraction of the uterus.  The device is designed with potential use in low-resource areas in mind.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: This device was designed by Robert Garfield, Ph.D., a researcher at Obstetric Solutions and Interventions LLC, at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
*Manufacturer location: This device is manufactured in the USA.

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
Pilot testing has occurred in the USA and will be expanded.
 
==Funding Source==
This endeavor was made possible by the $100,000 grant from the Gates Grand Challenges Exploration Grant.
