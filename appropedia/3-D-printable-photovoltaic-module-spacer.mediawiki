[[RepRap]] 3-D printing has already been shown to be a versatile tool for fabricating novel [[photovoltaic]] racking designs, however, they can also be useful for installing conventional PV modules on conventional racking. In order to ensure appropriate spacing and well oriented array these open-source photovoltaic spacers can be printed. The design has been created to be parametric in [[OpenSCAD]] so this design can be used for any conventional array.

The concept and testing of the design was performed by [http://www.solarup.org/ SolarUP]

The device is 100% 3-D printable and should be printed with a reasonable infill as this is a tool that will be used on a construction site. PLA is fine although other materials can be used.
