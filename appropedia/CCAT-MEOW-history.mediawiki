'''MEOW: Mobile Energy Operations Wagon'''

[[File:MEOWatCCAT.jpg]]

== Introduction ==
The Mobile Energy Operations Wagon at the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology, aka: The CCAT's MEOW,  is a mobile renewable energy system designed to power local university and community events by showcasing solar-electric technology for interpretive purposes

Humboldt State University Students involved with the Appropriate Technology course and The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology designed and built the Mobile Renewable Energy Trailer in 2003, which was later named the Mobile Energy Operating Wagon (MEOW).

[http://www.humboldt.edu/ Humboldt State University ]students involved with the Appropriate Technology course and The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology designed and built the Mobile Renewable Energy Trailer in 2003, which was later named the Mobile Energy Operating Wagon (MEOW).

The original proposal (submitted in 2003)contains useful information on the vision of the project, the budget, the energy system schematic, and a detailed list of materials used.

Additional work has been documented for:
* The [[CCAT MEOW rack]] in 2005.
* [[CCAT Mobile Energy Operations Wagon (MEOW) energy analysis|System refurbishment and energy analysis]] in 2010.  This page quantified the system's embedded energy and estimated the energy return on investment (EROI).
* [[CCAT Mobile Energy Operations Wagon (MEOW) V2]] in 2012. This page documents the new PV system that was built after the first MEOW was stolen in December 2010.
