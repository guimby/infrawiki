Small industries which produce goods for local consumption play an important role in a healthy economy. Many of the tools and equipment found in other categories of the AT Wiki could be the products of or could be used in small enterprises.

This category might include descriptions on the production of pottery, leather, soap, candles, paper, shoes, glassware, rattan furniture, hand looms, natural dyes, dairy and soy products, sewing machine maintenance and other topics. Among the activities that could form the basis of innovative businesses are the recycling of plastics and the production of single-strand barbed wire.
