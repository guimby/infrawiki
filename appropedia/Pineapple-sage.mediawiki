'''Pineapple sage''' (''Salvia elegans'') is a perennial herb with the aroma of pineapple. When flowering, it is a herb much liked by small nectar eaters, such as hummingbirds. The bees and butterflies also like its flowers. It is subtropical in origin but doesn't mind mild cool climates.

== Description ==
Pineapple sage has bright green leaves. It has bright red flowers that bloom from autumn to spring and even into summer, in milder climates. These flowers are tubular in shape and can be prolific when in full bloom.

The leaves smell strongly of ripe pineapple when rubbed between your fingers.

This plant can be found in a tall variety and a ground cover variety. The taller variety may need staking, depending on where it is grown and the form it takes on. The tall variety can grow to a height of around 90 to 120cm (3 to 4 feet). Its width is similar.

== Growing pineapple sage ==
Choose between growing in the garden bed or in a container; it'll do well in either. A container does allow you to bring it indoors if you live somewhere with harsh winters.

Choose a position with full sun. 

The soil needs to be moist but well-drained (the drainage is especially important for its roots to cope with winters). The soil needs to be moderately fertile.

== Caring for pineapple sage ==
This is an easy-care plant. Keep watered during warmer weather but don't overdo the watering.

== Problems ==
This plant can be prone to mildew if the air circulation around it is insufficient. Avoid mulching directly on its stem.

== Uses for pineapple sage ==
Use in fruit salads as a piquant addition.

Don't try to use as a substitute for other types of sage; it just doesn't have the same flavour profile as the other sages.
