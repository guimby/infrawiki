Wikipedia: [[wikipedia:Gurgaon#Raahgiri_Day|Gurgaon, Raahgiri Day]]: The city of Gurgaon organizes Raahgiri Day every Sunday and is modeled after Ciclovía, an event that began in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]] in 1976, which closes streets to cars and opens them for the exclusive use of people for running, cycling, skating, or other recreational activities. It is a concept adopted by several cities around the world. Gurgaon is the first and only city in India to hold this event. Launched in November 2013, over 2,00,000 people have participated in this event since then. Raahgiri Day is organized by a team of NGOs and citizens' groups. The NGOs associated with the event are Peddal Yatri, India Cycle Service, EMBARQ India, I am Gurgaon and Road Safety Officers.
