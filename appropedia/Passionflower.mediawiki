This vine is common throughout the humid tropics. Its delicious fruit is often called the granadilla or, of a slightly different variety, the maracuya.

Most commonly an infusion of the leaves is taken for depression, insomnia, anxiety, stress, migraines, headaches, stomach problems and to alleviate menstrual cramps or premenstrual syndrome. See the Raintree link below for more information.

The active alkaloid is harman
