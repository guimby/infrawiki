==Abstract==
This project stems from the OXFAM equipment catalog and attempts to make a 3D printed version of a speed brace. The purpose of this tool is to quickly remove fasteners after they have been broken loose using a breaker bar or ratchet. This tool is meant to be used with 1/2" drive sockets.

== Bill of Materials==

Here is a bill of materials. Costs are based on a $20.00 / Kg of PLA filament price:

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Hobby knife for print cleanup
# Hammer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
# [[Athena_Printing_Basics]]
# [[3D_Printing_Basics:MOST]]

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

=== Recommended Print Settings  ===
All STL files are orientated for printing. Print all objects according to the quantities listed in the BOM (Two "Joined_Corner" pieces are required).

# Layer Height: 0.25 mm
# Infill: 100%
# Support Material: None
# Shell Thickness: 2 lines
# Print Temp: 210 Degrees Celcius
# Print Time: Approx. 10 Hours

=== Part Preparation ===

# Clean all mating edges with a hobby knife. Be careful not to take too much off.
# Test fit parts while prepping the matting edges.
# If parts get stuck together use a 1/2" wrench and hammer to separate them.
# Parts should fit snugly together so that small taps with a hammer will seat the parts together.

=== Assembly ===
# Approximate Assembly Time: 30 Minutes
# After all parts are prepped lay them out as in the figure to the right.
[[Image:Speed_Brace_Assembly.png|400px|right]]
# (Optional) Apply JB Weld or similar two part epoxy to all joints.
# Make sure the fat end of the handle is away from the drive end.
# Seat all parts with a hammer.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* If 100% Infill does not provide enough strength there are a few options. 
# Epoxy all joints
# Try an alternate print material
# Future consideration: may redesign with an overall larger cross section area.

== Cost savings==
=== Commercial Equivalent ===
A 1/2" drive speed brace can be purchased for '''$41.08''' from [https://www.kctoolco.com/gedore-1985-speed-brace-1-2-395-mm/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAx7XBBRCdyNOw6PLHrYABEiQAJtyEQ8TcGDmh6oXW9opqS609jR8s3aQH9gCZqRI6LqCxWdwaArp68P8HAQ]

=== Savings in Dollars ===
Given the print cost of $5.12 shown in the BOM and the cost of the commercial equivalent being $41.08, the savings are $41.08 - $5.12 = '''$35.96 Savings'''

=== Savings in Percent ===
Given the dollar savings of $35.96 calculated above and the cost of the commercial equivalent being $41.08, the percentage savings are ($35.96 / $41.08) *100 = '''87.54 % Savings'''
