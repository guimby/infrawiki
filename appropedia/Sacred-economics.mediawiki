[http://sacred-economics.com/about-the-book/ Sacred Economics] by Charles Eisenstein traces the history of money from ancient [[gift economies]] to modern capitalism, revealing how the money system has contributed to alienation, competition, and scarcity, destroyed community, and necessitated endless growth.

Today, these trends have reached their extreme - but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being.


True to the [[gift economy]], the book is offered on a "pay what you want" basis, as well as hard copy. http://sacred-economics.com/read-online/
