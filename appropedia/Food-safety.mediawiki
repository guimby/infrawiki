== Fireless cookers and slow cookers ==
It is usually important that food is brought to a boil for an adequate time, particularly for foods such as meats or beans. This will help to kill any [[pathogens]], so they will not grow back too quickly when the temperature drops. With legumes (especially kidney beans and chickpeas), food poisoning is possible if they are not cooked at a high enough temperature - but with pre-soaking and then boiling for 20-25 minutes, this should not be a problem.

Simply warming or partially reheating food, then keeping it warm in the fireless cooker, is potentially dangerous, especially if the food is left for a long time, as the warm temperature will allow pathogens to grow more quickly. 

== Beans ==

With legumes, especially [[kidney beans]] and [[chickpeas]] (garbanzos), food poisoning is possible if they are not cooked properly.

With pre-soaking and then boiling for 20-25 minutes, this problem is avoided - the beans can then be placed in a fireless cooker.
See [[Cooking beans]] for more.
