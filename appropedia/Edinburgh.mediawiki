=== Cycling activism ===

Since 1999 the percentage of all trips in the city of Edinburgh made by bicycle has risen by an eighth, however travelling by bicycle still accounts for less than 2% of all trips taken by Edinburgh residents, with bicycle use lower than in many other European cities such as [[Amsterdam]] or [[Paris]]. Like most cities cycling is seen as a clean, environmentally friendly method of transportation, which needs little space, the provision of few, inexpensive facilities as well as a means of attempting to cut down on traffic congestion.

:At present there are around 75 km of off-road cycleways in the Edinburgh area, with a similar length on on-road cycleways in the city.[21] Greenways, which are the car-free bus corridors on the main radial routes into the city centre double up as cycle lanes.

:Many improvements in facilities for cyclists in Edinburgh can be attributed to Spokes, the Lothian Cycle Campaign, formed in 1977. Attempts to make Edinburgh more "cycle friendly" have been made, particularly by Spokes. Some cyclists remain unconvinced that the promise of a "Model Cycle-Friendly City" has been achieved. {{W|Cycling in Edinburgh}}

'''Walking''': A section of the Royal Mile - one of the main tourist streets in Edinburgh - from the junction of George IV Bridge (Melbourne Place) to the junction with North Bridge, is pedestrianised through the use of automatic bollards which only give access to authorised vehicles. This is an area with pavement cafes and bars with tables outside. <ref>[[wikipedia:Transport in Edinburgh#Pedestrians]]</ref>
