==Abstract==

<center>''Our project consisted of analyzing and restoring the existing rainwater catchment system located at La Yuca’s school. After repairs were completed, our group expanded the existing system and developed an easily accessible rainwater catchment system that captures, filters, and distributes water that can be used by the local community. It is our goal that available rainwater can be captured efficiently and filtered sufficiently to be used for faucet and toilet purposes, thus providing the community with a cost effective solution to their water shortage.''</center>

==Background==
This appropriate technology project is located in Dominican Republic in the La Yuca neighborhood of Santo Domingo. The student team includes 3 students from Humboldt State University and 4 students from UNIBE and the project is taking place in the month of June, 2014. Concurrent to the project, the Humboldt State students are taking classes at UNIBE in Santo Domingo. The classes are focused on appropriate technology and engineering and are paired with one Spanish class. The system in La Yuca is a rainwater catchment system which has been developed by previous groups over the last three years. The system has not been successful in consistently capturing rainwater and fully utilizing the storage tank attached to the system. The system is attached to the local school and it is a priority of the school to have running water and ideally potable drinking water.

==Objective==
Our objective for the water project for the 2014 [[Practivistas Dominicana Program]] in [[La Yuca ecoladrillo schoolroom 2011|La Yuca]] is to replace the flat piping system, used to catch rainwater runoff from the roof, with a gutter that will obtain more water. The extra water will be fed into an additional storage tank.

==Literature Review==
Here is the [[Practivistas rainwater 2014/Literature Review|link]] for the information we collected to help us understand and review information that will allow us to build the appropriate rainwater catchment system in La Yuca for the 2014 practivistas dominicana program.

==Cost==
The table below is a summary of the materials and their associated costs which were used for this upgrade of the La Yuca rainwater catchment system. It should be noted that these costs do not represent the entire costs of the rainwater system, for we only upgraded that catchment part of the system and did not build the distribution system throughout the school house. The previous appropedia pages can be referenced for more cost information.

===Buy Back===
This graph illustrates the time it would take for this system to pay itself back in the form of drinkable water. This system will pay itself off in less than a year assuming that the system will catch and use 60% of all rainfall for each given month. Assumed at 30,000 DOP because the system in la yuca was not complete, but rather added to; therefore a complete system would cost roughly 30,000 DOP. The system adds 850 DOP every year to take filter replacement costs into account.

==Design==
The design plan for the rainwater catchment system can be referenced in the model below. The design was done in Google Sketchup and represents the exact system for which our team built off of.
[[File:YUCASKETCH.jpg|center|720px|Google Sketchup of system: Alberto Jasso.]]

==Maintenance==
This system needs maintenance year-round to ensure that everything works properly and stays clean, especially when taking into account cleanliness of a potable system.

===Weekly===
*Make sure the botellon screen is clean
*Make sure there isn't too much debris in the gutter
*Make sure the first flush isn't clogged and water is able to drain to avoid mosquito breeding. Our team re-poked small holes that were previously clogged in the first flush to make sure water was able to drain out of the system after rain. Make sure the holes are too big that the first flush doesn't fully fill up.

===Monthly===
*Clean the first flush system
*Check for leaks
*Make sure the roof is clean (no debris on the roof)


===Yearly/Biyearly===
*Clean the tinaco
*Buy new filters Biyearly

 |File:La yucawire2014.jpg |Using string to follow for gutter setup. |1 |Set up a line to follow when setting up your gutter. Make sure the gutter is at an angle so the water can flow. We used L-brackets to putter the gutter on.
 |File:Guttersystemlayuca2014.jpg |Example of the U-brackets to hold the gutter. |2 |Secure your gutter. We used metal U-brackets to secure the gutter to the wall. We also eventually put a water shield on the far side of the gutter to ensure no water spilled over.

 |File:Layucafilters2014.jpg |All filters in the system. |7 |After the nylon filter the water should flow into an activated carbon filter. We split the flow to make sure more water was getting through the filters. After the filters the water should be clean enough to be considered potable.
