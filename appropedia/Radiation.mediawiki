'''Radiation''' is waves of [[energy]] or subatomic particles. The two types of radiation are ionizing and non-ionizing. 
==Ionizing==
Ionizing radiation energetic particles that are capable of ionizing an atom or molecule through atomic interactions. This is a function of the energy of the individual particles or waves, and not a function of the number of particles or waves present.

==Non-ionizing==

Non-ionizing radiation pertains to  any type of electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize atoms or molecules, or completely remove an electron from an atom or molecule.
