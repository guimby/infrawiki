'''ALLOTMENT FOLK''' by CHRIS OPPERMAN (New Holland Publishing)

This book features beautiful photographs and short interviews with some 40 [[allotment]] holders on their plots, celebrating the huge diversity of interests and approaches of 21st century diggers and dreamers. From topiary to tobacco plants, pumpkins to performance art, allotment shops to designer plots, it’s all in here... Allotments are the new rock ‘n’ roll so I’m told - certainly they are enjoying their biggest upsurge since the ‘Good Life’ days of the 1970s, and it’s great to see a lovely little book like this promoted in no less prestigious a shop window than Foyles in the Charing Cross Road! And who’s this on page 72? Why, it’s none other than our own [http://www.wlcsallotments.org.uk WLCS] secretary Graham showing off his (ahem) prize winning selection of wild grasses (and yes, that is Ron from Manchester Drive allotments on page 32)...

So get down to your local bookshop and treat yourself, and buy copies for your friends too!
