'''Six ways to die''' ('''6WTD''') is a simple model by [http://hexayurt.com/plan Vinay Gupta] which helps explain what needs to get done in a [[crisis]]. It explains some basic concepts about how infrastructure works in normal life and disaster. If you're interested in social resilience, crisis response and similar situations. 

'''It is part of the [http://www.archive.org/download/TheGuptaStateFailureManagementArchive/START_HERE__Dealing_in_Security__Simple_Critical_Infrastructure_Maps__July2010.pdf Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps] system. Please see that link for full details.'''

The six ways to die are:

* '''too hot''' (see [[cooling]] and [[shelter]])
* '''too cold''' (see [[heating]] and [[shelter]])
* ''thirst'' (see [[water supply]] and [[water purification]])
* ''hunger'' (see [[food]], [[agriculture]], [[organic and sustainable farming]], and [[permaculture]])
* ''illness'' (see [[public health]] and [[Portal:Medical Devices|medical devices]])
* ''injury'' (see [[medical treatment]] - planned for late 2011/early 2012)

Rough estimates of the threat in each area can be made, and systems or behaviors added to the situation to keep people safe. If people are not dying of one of these causes, they are not likely to be dying at any rate above [[baseline mortality]].

The Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps system expands the Six Ways To Die model to address the minimum functional needs of Groups, Organizations and States as follows:
* '''Individual''' Too Hot, Too Cold, Hunger, Thirst, Illness, Injury (solved by Shelter, Supply and Safety/Services)
* '''Groups''' Communications, Transport, Workspace - Resource Control
* '''Organizations''' Shared Map, Shared Plan, Shared Succession Model (to change leadership)
* '''States''' Effective Organizations, List of People, Map of Territories, International Recognition, Legal Jurisdiction

This model forms the core of the [State in A Box (SIAB) http://guptaoption.com/8.state_in_a_box.php] approach to State Failure, which envisages pushing much State responsibility down to the municipal and urban levels, and some of the remaining complex function (currency, identity) up to the international level, leaving a simplified-but-stable State which is capable of continuity in complex contingencies. The system is aimed at fragile states.
