A '''deck prism''' is inserted into the deck of a ship, providing light below. They have been used for centuries, safer than candles, oil and kerosene lamps (dangerous aboard a rocking wooden ship). 

It is laid flush into the deck, and the prism shape refracts natural light, dispersing it in the space below.
