A very simple method of drying [[bamboo]] that is used at [[New Dawn]] school in [[Costa Rica]] is to cut the bamboo and leave it vertical in the stand from which it was cut. You will want to prop it up on a rock (or some other non-wooden or bamboo substance) so that it will not wick moisture from the ground. The piece of bamboo leans in its home stand for a few months. The bamboo cures and is protected from rotting and pest invasion by the rest of the stand. When ready for use it is a good idea to set the bamboo in the sun for about a week. If there is any issue with pests you can cut a small home in the bamboo and pour about 1 tablespoon of diesel fuel in the hole and plug is back up.

Bamboo "cured" by this method has been used in construction in the area and holds up if it is well protected from the elements.
