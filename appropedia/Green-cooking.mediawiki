Relevant techniques include:
* [[Towel cooking]]: When a pot simply needs to be kept near boiling point (or higher in the case of a [[pressure cooker]]) taking it off the heat and wrapping it in a towel makes an instant [[fireless cooker]].

Relevant technologies include:
* [[Natural gas]] rather than [[electricity]]. However, avoid the escape of unburnt gas, which is a powerful [[greenhouse gas]].
* A [[retained heat cooker]] (hay basket or fireless cooker) to extend cooking time and keep food hot for 3-4 hours after cooking.
* An appropriate [[solar cooker]] model whenever the sun is shining. In modern kitchens this might be a task for the tinkerer or a project for children (avoid parabolas for safety reasons). In warm and warm-temperate climates, simple cookers can be surprisingly effective.
* Where wood is used as a fuel, an [[improved cookstove]] (i.e. efficient cook stove) for use when there is not sufficient sunshine for a solar cooker.
* [[Integrated cooking]] combines retained heat, solar, and improved cookstove, as [[appropriate]].
* [[Pressure cooker]].
* [[Raw Food]] Reduces energy use & retains more nutrition. Includes [[Sprouting]] and [[Fermenting]].
