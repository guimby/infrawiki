== Designing a garden with fragrant shrubs ==

Consider placing the shrubs where they will release their scent in noticeable ways. For example, situating shrubs near an outdoor dining area or where people sit for relaxation. Or, having a shrub near a bedroom window for summer scents. The front entry gate can be a great place for adding a fragrant shrub, to welcome people as they enter your yard. Don't neglect the workplace; a fragrant shrub might lift spirits as its scent wafts through open windows or greets employees at the entrance way.
