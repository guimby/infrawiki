This page shows [[open source]] scientific hardware, which can be used to make [[open source labs]] created by [https://backyardbrains.com/ Backyard Brains].

Backyard Brains enables everyone to be a neuroscientist! They provide affordable neuroscience experiment kits for students of all ages to learn (hands-on) about electrophysiology. Now everyone from schoolchildren to grad students and every grade in between can experiment with similar tools used by real neuroscientists worldwide! By following a few simple steps, everyone can experience first-hand how the brain communicates with our sense, memories, hopes, and desires.
