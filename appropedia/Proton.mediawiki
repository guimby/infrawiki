In physics, the '''proton''' (Greek πρώτον / proton = first) is a subatomic particle with an electric charge of one positive fundamental unit (1.602 × 10−19 coulomb), a diameter of about 1.6 to 1.7×10−15 m [1], and a mass of 938.27231(28) MeV/c2 (1.6726 × 10−27 kg), 1.007 276 466 88(13) u or about 1836 times the mass of an electron.

Protons are spin-1/2 fermions and are composed of three quarks[2], making them baryons. The two up quarks and one down quark of the proton are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons.
