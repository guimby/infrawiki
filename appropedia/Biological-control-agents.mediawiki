This involves the use of natural enemies (bred specificly for this purpose) to fight pests and diseases. The natural enemies do this as follows:
* They suck the plague organism empty , such as the larva of the lacewing and the gall midge and the predatory mite
* They lay an egg in the plague organism, such as the parasitic wasp.
* They eat the pest organism, such as the larvae of the ladybug and the predatory bug
* They secrete toxic compounds into the plague or pest organism to make it ill in one or another way, such as nematodes and bacteria
