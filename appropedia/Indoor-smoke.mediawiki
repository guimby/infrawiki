'''Indoor smoke''' is a problem caused by fires used for [[cooking]] and [[lighting]] - e.g. [[kerosene lamps]], [[kerosene stoves]], and open [[dung fires]]. This is a major [[public health]] issue in [[poor countries]].

Indoor smoke is a very severe form of [[indoor air pollution]], causing health problems such as [[respiratory disease]] and [[eye disease]], which are major causes of death and disability.

== Solutions ==

[[Improved cook stoves]] and [[renewable energy]] lighting are important tools in the fight against indoor smoke.

Education is also an issue - where people have grown up with traditional methods, and burning of rubbish and organic waste is a regular activity, people may be accustomed to smoke and not regard it as harmful, or even regard a certain amount of smoke as good for keeping away insects. (If insects are an issue, other methods of protecting from pests must be found, [[community participation|together with the community]].)
