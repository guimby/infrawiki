'''Media and communications''' are essential to knowledge sharing and the functioning of a vibrant society. 

Grass-roots groups and other community organizations wishing to share their successful ideas with a larger audience will be faced with the problem of how to make this information available in a low-cost, understandable form. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of attention paid to the importance of how organizations and movements are "framed" in the context of the larger social, political and cultural narratives. The technologies, techniques, and methods described in this category should be helpful in choosing ways to present information effectively and at low cost.

Such approaches will also involve close collaboration between researchers and beneficiaries, and mechanisms to ensure that technical support for problem-solving can be provided when requested by villagers. Visits by individuals from one community to another, technical data banks responsive to rural requests, and community-based media projects also have a place.
