== Bill of Materials==
# No additional materials needed. Open source softwares, computer and RepRap is all you need.

## [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:577616 STL]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# [http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD]
# Slicing Software, like [http://software.ultimaker.com/ Cura] or [http://slic3r.org/ Slic3r]

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* No special skill(s) needed.

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
No special instructions needed. Pretty straight-forward.
=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Include common mistakes/problems to avoid in building your OSAT and how to overcome them

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
Typical handlebar grip costs anywhere between $3 - $8 [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=handlebar+grips&sprefix=handlebar+%2Caps%2C169 Amazon]. The 3D printed equivalent costs about 60 cents for a pair. So the cost basically reduced about 10 times the commercial equivalent.
