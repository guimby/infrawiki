For the rehabilitation of the land to its previous state (the state in which it was in 1900; before any major human interference to the environment was done), we must first determine the state baseline state. This can be done based on several sources:
* The world forest cover in 6000 BC (see image to the right)
* The world grasslands (see image on the right)
* The world deserts (see image on the right)
* ...

Note that the deserts can actually be planted with plantations (ie orchards, ...) and specific plants (ie hardleafed vegetation). The islands are colored as pasturage zones, but should actually be planted with native plants (in some cases this can be pasturage, but often it's a vegetation specific to the island in question)
