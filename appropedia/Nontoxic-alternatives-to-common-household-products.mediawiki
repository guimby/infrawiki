Tracie Schulz originally crafted the following material on a rather large poster. Thank you Tracie for your time invested in making the original poster thorough and artistic. The, "Introduction and How to use sections were written by Michael Padget.

All information in this, "Non-toxic Alternatives," compilation are gathered from sources sited at the end of the document. Information displayed on this website page is intended for educational use only. Neither the authors nor CCAT take responsibility for the validity of the following information. Use at your own discretion and with common sense.

==Introduction==
"Next to nothing is currently known about the human toxic effects of almost 80 percent of the more than 48,000 chemicals listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency," says Debra Lynn Dadd in a book called, "Nontoxic, Natural, & Earthwise," (page 7). The need for a practical reference for safe cleaning methods is obvious from Dadd’s statement. Non-toxic Alternatives to Common Household Products is a compilation from various alternative methods to risky chemical products.

There are two main reasons for using Non-toxic alternatives, your personal health and the problematic effects of toxic chemicals to the environment. According to Debra Lynn Dadd, "Every year 5 to 10 million household poisonings are reported as the result of accidental exposure to toxic products in the home." Health related problems caused by synthetic and toxic product range from mild nausea to death.

Commercially produced toxic household products are disastrous to the environment. Waste is inherent from resource gathering stages, use in the home and disposal of toxic chemicals. The contamination of ground waters, landfill problems, transportation pollution and animal species are the result. Often times the environment takes many years to recover from the pollution.

On the following page figure 1 indicates a cycle of chemical cleaning products in the environment. The diagram begins with a resource gathered from nature. Next the resource is refined into a product, stored and shelved at a market. From the market consumers purchase and use the product. The material left over after consumption is the waste product. Notice that energy is required to produce, refine, dispose, and transport for each part of the cycle.

There are alternatives and benefits to common household products that are safe for humans and the environment too. One great benefit of natural products is that they break down compositionally in soil and water. Cleaners can often times be made and disposed of right in or around the home. The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) has examples of alternative disposal systems. Bacteria in the [[CCAT grey water system]] and garden have proven to break down non-toxic products effectively. Over all, natural products make sense for both people and the environment.

==How to use this Encyclopedia==
This document is a compilation of information that is organized in three ways for each household cleaner topic. First, there is a section on Common Harmful Ingredients and Health Hazards to common commercial ingredients. The second section is Homemade Alternatives with instructions for how to use. The third section is Non-toxic Commercial Alternatives noting where to get environmentally friendly products.
Index

==Ammonia and All-purpose Cleaners==
===Common Harmful ingredients and Health Hazards===
<br />
*Ammonia-irritant to eyes and respiratory tract 
*Artificial dyes-highly carcinogenic, easily absorbed through skin 
*Detergents-responsible for more household poisoning than any other substance 
*Fragrances-headaches, all types of nervous system symptoms 

===Homemade Alternatives===
'''Any combination of:'''
*Baking soda-absorbs odors and chemicals, mild abrasive
*Borax-disinfects, deodorizes, inhibits molds, mild abrasive 
*Lemon juice or vinegar-to cut grease 
*Washing soda-cuts grease for tough jobs (Do not use Arm and Hammer because it is scented and contains other chemical additives.) 
*Vegetable oil based sap, like Lifeline 

===Non-Toxic Commercial Alternatives===
*Heavenly Horsetail all-purpose Cleaner, ''Natural Lifestyle Supplies, 16 Lookout Drive, Asheville, NC, 28804.''
*Natural Bodycare Citrus Organic Cleaner, ''Earth Herbs, 40 North Fir Street, Ventura, CA, 93001. ($1 catalog)''
*Life Tree Liquid Home Soap
*Dr. Bronner’s SAL Suds

==Basin, Tub, and Tile Cleaners==
===Common Harmful Ingredients and their Health Hazards===
*Ammonia-irritant to eyes and respiratory tract 
*Detergents-responsible for more household poisoning than any other substance 
*Fragrances-headaches, all types of nervous system symptoms 
*Aerosol Propellants- can cause lung irritation, cancer, heart problems, central nervous system depression, headaches, nausea, dizziness, eye and throat irritation
*Ethanol-can cause central nervous system depression, impaired motor coordination, stupor shock, hypothermia, possible death 

===Homemade Alternatives===
*Baking soda- with a little Lifeline or other vegetable oil based liquid soap
*For more stubborn stains, scrub with lemon slices or ends dipped in baking soda or borax. 
*For really stubborn stains, leave lemons and scouring agent on stains overnight. Lemons and Borax have a bleaching affect.
*Steam - boil some water in a kettle and manually blow the steam onto the tiles or ceramic surface. Use a sponge that will not scratch, or a tissue paper that is coarse in structure. This takes away many types of normal grease stains, also from stoves and counter tops.

===Non-Toxic Commercial Alternatives===
*See all-purpose cleaners listed above.

==Bleach==
===Common Harmful Ingredients and their Health Hazards===
*Artificial dyes-highly carcinogenic, easily absorbed through skin 
*Detergents-responsible for more household poisoning than any other substance 
*Fragrances-headaches, all types of nervous system symptoms 
*Chlorine-can cause pain and inflammation of mouth, throat and stomach, and erosion of mucous membranes, irritation to eyes, rashes, dizziness, vomiting, severe respiratory tract irritation
*Lye, fluorescent brighteners 

===Homemade Alternatives===
*Use a water softener or Water Conditioner that prevents mineral deposits and soap sum from accumulating on fabrics making them look dingy. Then you won’t need bleach. (See also suggestions under Spot Removers)
*To clean laundry of accumulated mineral deposits or soap film-use a Water Softener (Listed below). Run through the wash cycle with greater amount of softener and no soap or detergent.

===Non-Toxic Commercial Alternatives===
*Ecover Alternative Bleach with out Chlorine. 
*Winter White Powdered Bleach, from Mountain Fresh, ''P.O. Box 40516, Grand Junction, CO, 81504. (303) 434-8434''

*Sodium Hexametaphosphate (High in salt so not good for Grey Water Systems) "Probably the best substance you could use in your dishwasher" says Debra Lynn Dadd. Na12 (PO4) 6 cuts grease, leaving dishes spotless and acts as a scale inhibitor actually cleaning the dishwasher. Avoid dishwashing liquids in dishwashers because bubbles can clog the drain inhibiting water-spraying action.
