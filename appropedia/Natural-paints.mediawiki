==Introductions==

This page describes natural paints as a potential component of [[United States of America]] home construction.  Only a few decades ago, the petrochemical industry largely took over the production of oil-based and water-based paints.  The idea that paint should be able to breath was abandoned. Also, added synthetic chemicals are very harmful to humans and animals.  Natural paints derived from plant and mineral materials have subtle, soothing colors, pleasant scents, and help create a healthy environment.<ref>

===A Brief History===

Creating durable, beautiful paints out of natural ingredients is not a new phenomenon. For millenia, people have been using the materials around them to create paints to color their worlds. Examples of natural paints can be found in the earliest cave drawings. They can be found in the world's most prestigious museums. And they can be found in the average home.


Over time, synthetic, toxic and energy-intensive materials -- such as formaldehyde -- were added to the paints that people use in their homes.<ref>This information according to http://ezproxy.humboldt.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=afh&AN=4096867&site=ehost-live</ref> These materials weren't added specifically to cause harm, but that didn't lessen their harmful effects. Some of these materials include synthetic dyes to increase color choices, additives to combat mold, and non-water-based binders such as petroleum products and heavy metals which were designed to withstand high use areas like kitchens.<ref name="Greenhome">This information according to http://greenhomeguide.com/know-how/article/selecting-green-paint</ref> A notable example is the lead-based paints that were once popular, but have now been linked to serious health risks.


But interest in natural paints has recently resurfaced in the face of growing concern for our environment, bringing people back to the techniques and materials that have stood the test of time. Still, it is important to understand that "natural" doesn't automatically mean "non-toxic" or "safe." Please use the information on this page to help inform your decisions about which natural paints are best for you and your home.


Below are examples of natural paints in action: beautiful, durable, and eco-groovy.

===Natural Paint Basics===

{{main|Natural paint basics}}
[[Image:Pigment_byHeatherBrown.jpg|thumb|Natural earth pigments add color to natural paints and are available at artist supply stores.<ref>Photo courtesy of Heather Brown.</ref>]]
Paint generally has three main ingredients or parts.

# The first part is the <b>pigment</b>, which is responsible for the color of the paint.<ref name="NatPaint">This information is according to [[Natural paint basics]]</ref>
# The second part is the <b>solvent</b>. The solvent keeps the paint in liquid form and evaporates off as the paint dries.<ref name="Greenhome"/> Solvent can also be used during the painting process to clean paint spills and correct mistakes.<ref name="NatPaint"/>
# The third part of paint is the <b>binder</b>, which, as its name suggests, binds the paint together. This is the main body of paint.<ref name="NatPaint"/>
# A fourth, optional component of paint is a <b>filler</b>. Fillers can be used to manipulate the texture and consistency of paint, and to reinforce the binder.<ref name="NatPaint"/>

==Drawbacks of synthetic paints==

===VOCs/Indoor Air Quality===

*[[Volatile Organic Compounds]], or VOCs, such as those found in synthetic household paints can cause physical irritation and/or damage including irritation of eyes, nose and throat, headaches, loss of coordination, nausea, liver, kidney and central nervous system damage and some are carcinogenic.<ref name="EPA VOC">This information is according to http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html</ref>
*Common organic pollutants (including VOCs) have been found in higher concentrations ''within the home'' than outside.<ref name="EPA VOC"/>
*Paints labeled "no-VOC" and "zero-VOC" can still legally contain up to 5g/L of VOCs.<ref name="Greenhome"/>
*Modern "lead-free" synthetic paints can still have as much as 0.06% lead which scientists fear could be harmful to small children, even at low levels. <ref>This information is according to [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:jBfBNYQr_8oJ:www.epa.gov/epp/pubs/case/paint.pdf+GS-11+paints,+natural+paint,+site:.gov&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjFBOhhK1Sptv0bAyGgQeaCvIEcOGTC8Z1e4CKuNd0Cbj4prqlHkI3BfwdDmf5WVe4kXNKIYHeIe9fqOnlGp-NQ2CyMI8HmXV8ymcHBAEIBSxIy9OyIPodpkZvrckQCWzOK5PjO&sig=AHIEtbRz_RRLt3e1Q9b1HHOKy2guyJx_zg ''Painting the Town Green'' Aberdeen Proving Groundâ€™s Paint Pilot Project]</ref>

===Waste===

*By volume, household paints account for a large portion of household hazardous waste in US homes.<ref name="OCAPP">This information according to [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:6SycTLXYP5gJ:www.epa.ohio.gov/LinkClick.aspx%3Ffileticket%3DTV%252FZRe4a3Es%253D%26tabid%3D2646+how+to+dispose+of+household+paint,+US,+site:gov&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShhfKKTkboaROlw8h4oN28UUEe7xYSFpmd8o7oEEHJwGMUIrZzOE4R6yhiA5iO-9bA0kjy67nyFj5zkMrzy1Cpwk3bLMkr0itXhptbNIKLNtsa9M-Gk36LJv04OKa6dWVLFQ5dR&sig=AHIEtbQBCQsXOYMFF9YH9zayQ8y117P98A ''Storing and Disposing of Paint from Your Home'' by OCAPP]</ref>

* Household latex paint, oil-based paint and paint thinner are considered "hazardous waste" by the EPA. <ref>This information according to http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/dpwes/trash/disphhw.htm</ref>

* Although considered less detrimental to health and the environment than oil-based paints, latex paint contains hazardous ingredients such as acrylics, vinyls and epoxies.<ref>This information according to http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/p2au/pps/hhwp/paint/latex.htm</ref>

* In California specifically, latex paint must be disposed of in a Class I hazardous waste landfill. <ref name="Calrecycle">This information according to http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/condemo/paint/</ref>

* Oil-based paints commonly contain petrochemical products as a solvent.<ref name="Calrecycle"/>

* Until 1990, mercury was used as an ingredient in oil-based and latex household paints. Leftover oil-based and latex household paints from before then may contain mercury, and oil-based paints that are several years old may also contain lead.<ref name="OCAPP"/>

* In the UK, the government also classifies household paint as "hazardous waste." <ref name="Ecologist">This information according to http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/home/268680/natural_house_paintsgood_enough_to_eat.html</ref>

* Because synthetic household paints contain hazardous ingredients, they cannot be thrown into a regular garbage can. Depending on the type of paint, the disposal process may include tedious drying-out processes, finding a recycling center that accepts paint or locating hazardous waste collection programs. <ref>This information according to http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/p2au/pps/hhwp/paint/latex.htm</ref>

* People with unused or leftover household paints that can be classified as hazardous waste are encouraged to donate, return or swap paint to reduce waste.<ref name="OCAPP"/>

* Even in production, it is estimated that for every 1000 kilograms of synthetic paint produced, 10,000 kilograms of waste are created. For specialty paints, this can be as high as 30,000 kilograms of waste.<ref name="Ecologist"/>

* Titanium dioxide is a key ingredient in synthetic paints, and must be mined and processed in environmentally damaging ways.<ref name="Ecologist"/>

==Impacts of natural paint==

===Advantages===

* Using natural paint can reduce the amount of VOCs present in the home, improving indoor air quality.
* Natural paints are microporous, allowing the walls to breathe. Because moisture is not trapped between the wall and the layer of paint, there is no blistering or peeling.<ref name="Milewye">This information according to http://www.mikewye.co.uk/TheBenefitsofNaturalPaints.pdf</ref>
* Natural paints do not use petroleum products and contain ingredients from sustainable sources.<ref name="Milewye"/>
* Because of their non-toxic, natural ingredients, many natural paints are biodegradable, easily disposed of and even fit for a household compost pile once dried. This reduces landfill mass, environmental pollution and disposal costs compared to synthetic paints.<ref>This information according to http://www.bot.yildiz.edu.tr/ids09/_data/_readings/DESIGN%20AND%20DETAILING%20FOR%20DECONST.pdf</ref>

===Disadvantages===

* Natural paints, especially store bought, may be more expensive than synthetic paints.<ref name="Seattle">This information according to http://www.seattle.gov/purchasing/pdf/RPNPaint.pdf
</ref>
* Natural paints may be more difficult to work with than synthetic paints because of texture, rate of drying and inconsistent coloring from batch to batch.<ref name="NPP"/>
* Although anecdotally durable and resistant, there is a lack of performance data on natural paints, so it is important to test natural paint before committing to a contract.<ref name="Seattle"/>

===Types of Natural Paints===

====Water-based paint====
Water-based paints are the best choices for an environmentally-friendly solvent{{fact}}. Distemper and lime wash are two popular examples.<ref name="NatPaint"/>

====Casein or Milk paint====
Casein paint is made from a protein commonly found in dairy, and is often called "milk paint" or "milk-based paint." This paint is mold resistant, durable and compostable.<ref name="NatPaint"/> However, if not allowed to dry properly, milk-based paint can sour or mold.<ref>This information according to Paula Baker-Laporte, Erica Elliot and John Banta, "Prescriptions for A Healthy House. A Practical guide for Architects, Builders & Homeowners." New Society Publishers, 2001.</ref>

====Tempera or Egg paint====
Egg-based paint is durable and quick to dry. It dries to a glossy finish.<ref name="NatPaint"/>

====Flour paint====
Flour paint, though thick and tough on brushes, can be used on a wide range of household surfaces including wallpaper and drywall.<ref name="NatPaint"/>

====Oil-based paint====
Commonly made from linseed oil, natural oil-based paints are durable and have a velvety texture.<ref name="NatPaint"/>
