=Note=
* Pilot holes facilitate assembly but are not necessary, especially if Baltic Birch plywood is used.
* Try not to drill pilot holes all the way through the linking boards.
* Linking board mounting screws are located in difficult-to-reach locations and pilot holes can simplify assembly of the motor and idler ends.
* The holes in the vertical boards are through-holes, passing through the entire length of the board.
* To minimize swelling and shrinking due to changes in humidity, sealing the plywood is recommended.

=Procedure=
See video instructions on [[Delta Motor End Assembly:MOST|Motor End Assembly]] for similar instruction.

==Linking Board Pilot Holes==
# [[File:athena_linking_board_templates.JPG|thumb|right|Linking board templates.]] There are two linking board pilot hole jigs for accurately locating the positions of pilot holes. One each for the left and right sides of the boards. Ream the holes in the triangular pattern with a 3mm (1/8") drill bit.
# [[File:athena_mark_linking_board.JPG|thumb|right|Marking one edge of the boards.]] Stack the linking boards so that their edges are up and mark that edge with a pencil.{{clear}}
# [[File:athena_linking_jig.JPG|thumb|right|Marking linking board pilot hole locations.]] Place one of the pilot hole jigs on the end of a board with the marked edge of the board on the same side as the narrow stop at the bottom of the jig. Push the board firmly into the jig and with a sharp pencil, mark the location of the pilot holes. Repeat with the other jig on the opposite end of the board ensuring that the marked edge is towards the bottom of the jig.{{clear}}
# Repeat with the remaining linking boards.
# [[File:athena_Delta_drilling_pilot_linking.JPG|thumb|right|Drilling linking board pilot holes.]]Drill 2mm (1/16") pilot holes at the marked positions on each board being careful to not drill all the way through the board.{{clear}}

==Vertical Board Through Holes==
# [[File:athena_vertical_board_template.JPG|thumb|right|Vertical board template.]] Locate the vertical board through hole template and ream the holes with a 3mm drill bit.{{clear}}
# [[File:athena_mark_vertical_board.JPG|thumb|right|Marking one edge of a board.]] Butt the template against one corner of a board as shown in the picture and mark the locations with a sharp pencil. Repeat on the opposite end of the board. Mark all three vertical boards.{{clear}}
# [[File:athena_drill_vertical_board.JPG|thumb|right|Drill through the board with a 3mm drill bit.]] Drill through the board with a 3mm drill bit.{{clear}}
