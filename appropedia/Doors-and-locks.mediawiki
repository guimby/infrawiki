==Doors, locks and screwdrivers==
Although it may seem quite banal at first glance, I was thinking about making a schematic + page about doors and locks. This because specific door types may provide increased security, provide benefits regarding energy conservation (they keep warmth in and draft out), ... I'm thinking that a schematic may provide some help in selecting the best type of door for each task. Also, I'm thinking of having some info on the page regarding the selection of door springs --> see http://www.energiebespaarshop.be/shop/index.php/cPath/34 these devices can help ensuring that doors keep closed, hereby eliminating draft. This is useful for eg patio doors, and doors used in corridors, ...

In addition, I was thinking about detailing some info on locks; my first idea was to make a basic keylock that basic artisans could make. However, as RFID is on the rise, I'm guessing it won't be long untill this type of lock is discarded (along with card/keypad-locks). Thus I'm not sure whether its useful to still include such a design (a basic design would btw not be very secure neither, they can simply be picked, although one needs to be somewhat skilled in this). Key-locks can also not be made modular (as the turn of the key provides the energy for the unlocking process). Perhaps that a keypad lock could be made modular (already electrified) so that cards, RFID, ... can be supported in the future (not sure), but I'm focusing for the moment on an other solution; remote control. This as it doesn't require a direct connection, and it is thus possible to place the locking mechanism somewhat furtherup. This is handy as I'm simply using (the idea of) a hydraulic pole. This method can be used with a variety of door types. Perhaps we can draw out the RC hydraulic pole in detail in the future. For securing it, as well as for [[piggybacking]] reasons, we could simply use an encrypted RC system as used in current commercial garage doors.

:: Excellent drawing. I have seen one kind of door that is missing in that image: the [[Wikipedia: gull-wing door]]. A solid door that has one hinge at the top. when open, the door sticks straight out and up from that hinge. The door is a little wider than the opening so that, when closed, it seals out drafts on the left and right. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 22:31, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

:::This type of door falls roughly in the hinged doors category; there are many other subtypes I didn't mention to not overcomplicate the image. Perhaps that if others too find that it deserves its own category, I'll update the image in a next version.

:::UPDATE: besides focusing on the locks and door mechanisms, the doors themselves also need some attention. From what I saw from the Earthship Biotecture guys, they actually prefer wood as a door material, and also design it in a very difficult manner (by using plywood that they glue together on a V-like pattern, and finish it with 4 boards for the edges). Personally, I'd like to advocate a simple, single piece of (cut or cast) metal. Wood could be used if metal is too expensive locally, but in this case, I would advocate another method to construct it. This method could be simply by laying boards together (without leaving any space in between) and then [[screw]]ing (not nailing !) them into a second layer of boards (ie 3; 2 for the endpoints and 1 in the middle). The screws would need to be inserted from the side that opens (to prevent simply screwing them out by burglars, ...). An alternative design that also provides protection against crowbars (by simply pulling the boards out by placing the crowbar between the boards), I was thinking of a up-and-over type of hinged door where the door is placed behind the walls (instead of before) and where the boards are larger than the wall opening. The lock would then be a hydraulic pole at the center of the opening.

==Most useful types of locks, depending on the door type==

===Warded lock===
-->most useful for:

As too can be read on the wikipedia article, the warded lock is a relatively insecure lock, which however is simple to make and inexpensive. This lock would be most suitable for villages/communities where everyone knows each other and theft/breaking in is unlikely. In these situations, a simple, inexpensive lock that is just used to lock off a door from either side of the door is most useful.
