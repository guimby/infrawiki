This article details on specifics regarding food production on (sub)tropical islands.

==Oceania==
===Island types===
In the Pacific, 2 types of islands can be distinguished:
* Low lying islands --> ie atols --> soil type: pulverised coral; very poor; limited freshwater storage capability in soil
* High lying islands --> ie vulcanic islands --> soil type: vulcanic debris; medium to very rich; high freshwater storage capability in soil; especially valleys are the most suitable locations for agriculture since they have a thicker layer of soil

The main limiting factor to agriculture on (sub)tropical islands is the freshwater storage capability in the soil. In essence, the low lying islands are so il-equipped to store freshwater that no agriculture is practiced on these islands at all. Rather, food is gathered by hunting and fishing and the islands are only occupied for a short period of time; untill the water stores have been depleted. The high lying islands ''are'' suitable for agriculture and 2 island subtypes can be distinguished, namely those with medium and with very rich soil; the latter allowing the growing of 2 additional crops, knowingly taro's and bananas.

===Suitable crops===
High lying islands with medium rich soil: allows the cultivation of coconuts, pandanus, breadfruit, yam, sweet potatoes. Examples: Marshall and Ellice island

High lying islands with very rich soil: allows the cultivation of coconuts, pandanus, breadfruit, yam, sweet potatoes, taro's and bananas. Examples: Gilbertese islands, Tokelau

===Crop description===
Taro: requires richer soil, though less freshwater; grows all year, mature after 6 months, easy cultivation

Yam: requires less rich soil, though more freshwater; harvested once a year, roots can be stored

Coconut <!-- Leftover fibre edible ? see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut -->

Breadfruit: requires rich soil, harvested once a year (several varieties can be grown which are ripe at varying parts of the year), mature after 5 years

Pandanus:

Cararium-almond: used as a spice

Areca-nut:
