==Definition==
Particulates are little particles that float around in the atmosphere.  They can either be solid or semi-solid.  We usually see this in terms of haze or smog.

In [[water]], particulates are referred to as [[suspended solids]].

==Where Do They Come From?==

* wind blown dust particles from roads, fields and construction
* coal dust, fly ash, and combustion from various combustion sources
* automobile exhaust

==Particle Size==
*less than 0.1 micrometer up to 45 micrometers: total suspended particles
*larger particles seem to not remain suspended in the air

==Is it Bad for You?==
*The nose filters out roughly 99% of particulate matter
*Can cause respiratory problems as well as Lung Cancer
