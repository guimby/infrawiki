For centuries, the original "mass-market" computer, the mechanical time-keeping clock, was typically powered by slowly releasing the energy stored in a mass by displacing it by hand against the force of gravity. Now this storage method is being explored by Deciwatt as a SMALL-SCALE means of generating electricity. Please see http://deciwatt.org/ and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ovoBKuX5II

Our sincere thanks go to ''Science Friday'', for bringing our attention to this effort; too bad their story lead-in suggests that their reporter never passed high-school physics, or even sadder yet, attended an American high-school which passed her in physics.
