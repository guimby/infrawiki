When repotting a plant from the original container, a container it has outgrown or the container in which it was purchased, there is a basic rule to follow:

Choose a container or pot with a top diameter equivalent to about one third to one half of the height of the plant.

It is also best when repotting to move a plant up one container size bigger than the one it currently grows in.

== Tips ==
*Always repot into a clean container. This does not have to be a new container, just a clean one, to ensure that any disease from prior plants growing it is not passed on. To clean, scrub like dishes if the containers are plastic or glazed. For clay or terracotta pots, use 1/2 cup household bleach to one standard bucket of hot water and dip the pot into the bucket and leaving the container to soak for for a few hours. Scrub after taking it out of the water.
