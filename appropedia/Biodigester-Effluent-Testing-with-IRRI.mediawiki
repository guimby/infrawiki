Testing biodigester effluent (or biol) is important in order to know how effective biodigesters work as a waste management solution for improving water quality.  A lot of animal waste ends up untreated and in rivers causing problems of algal blooms, reduced oxygen availability for other living organisms like fish and plants, and can cause serious health issues in humans.  

Testing biodigester effluent is also important in order to know how effective it is as a fertilizer.  Many farmers rely on manure from their animals and biodigesters take this animal manure to produce gas.  Making sure the resulting biodigester effluent can also be used as a fertilizer with equal or better results to that of traditional or commonly used fertilizers is extremely important to insuring that the biodigester can become an integrated addition to the farm.
