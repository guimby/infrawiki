The '''Fused Grid''' is a proposed street layout that combines elements of the grid pattern ("[[Smart Growth]]‚Äù and neo-traditional neighborhood design / [[New Urbanism]]) with the loop and curl street patterns of urban development in recent decades. 

Each of those existing street patterns (grids and loops) has positive attributes yet neither satisfies all the needs of [[sustainability]], safety (accident avoidance), living environment and [[quality of life]].
