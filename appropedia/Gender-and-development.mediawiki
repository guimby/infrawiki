{{topic header| default.png |Gender}}
Gender, and particularly the role of [[women]], is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues. This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[community participation|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.{{fact}}

As well as directly addressing inequality, attention to gender issues is regarded as important to the success of development programs, for all participants. 

== Participation and differences between cultures ==

In many cultures it can be difficult for women to express themselves when men are present, including in public meetings.

In some cultures women may appear outspoken and "liberated" to an outsider. It is important not to make assumptions based only on such impressions, as behavior (of both genders but especially women) may still be very constrained. 

It is also important not to assume that in every case and in every way the women are repressed by the men. Where generalizations are unavoidable (which may be the case in microfinance, if women are statistically better clients) it should not be forgotten that these are generalizations, and steps might be taken to  minimize the negative impacts of these generalizations. 

There are wide differences between cultures, e.g. the matriarchal Minang of Sumatra.

== Strategies that empower women ==

=== Microfinance ===

In [[microfinance]] it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be the over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans. Also, it is claimed that women are more likely to use the money for the benefit of their families.{{fact}}

=== Sanitation programs ===

Development consultant [[Kamal Kar]] has described the particular difficulties of women in poor Bangladeshi villages where [[open defecation]] is practised; women are expected to not practise open defecation during daylight hours and suffer discomfort and health problems{{fact}} as a result. Access to safe, private toilets helps resolve this problem.

=== Sanitary pads ===

It is also reported that in some countries, girls often do not have access to sanitary pads,{{w|sanitary pad}} and cannot attend school while menstruating. The [[papyrus sanitary pad]]{{w|papyrus sanitary pad}} is a way of helping these girls attend school.

=== Suitable latrines in schools ===

What do latrines have to do with education? Two of the [[wikipedia:Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals]], one for universal primary education, and the other for [[gender]] equality, combine to generate the link to latrines. A web search for "girls education latrines" turns up numerous discussions that one of the barriers to girls attending primary school is a lack of safe and private latrines.  For example:

The upshot is that school construction projects should include gender specific latrine facilities.
