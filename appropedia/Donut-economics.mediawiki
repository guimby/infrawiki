'''[http://www.doughnuteconomics.org/ Donut economics]''' is an economic theory developed by [http://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/ Kate Raworth] from [[Oxfam]] which places humanity’s 21st century challenge as ensuring that every person has the resources they need to meet their human rights, while collectively we live within the ecological means of this one planet [http://oxfamblogs.org/doughnut/]. The ‘doughnut’ of planetary and social boundaries is an approach to framing that challenge as seen below:
