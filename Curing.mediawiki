'''Curing''' refers to salting or brining of food. The salt dries out the food (trough a process called [[osmosis]]), inhibiting the growth of microbes and bacteria.

Salting or dry curing is the applying of salt on the surface of the food. Generally, a layer of about 1-2 cm salt is used, and it left on the food for 1 to 2 days. It is then washed off and left to dry for 24 hours.

Brining is the applying of brine on the food. Brine is made by dissolving 1.3kg salt for every 1 liter of water.<ref>Practical self-sufficiency by Dick and James Strawbridge</ref>
