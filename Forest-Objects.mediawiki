Here can be seen some measurements derived from a forest based culture:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_units_of_measurement

motti – 1 m³ (firewood or waste paper)
toltti – 12 (lumber)
# poronkusema – (approximately 7.5 km). A Lappish measurement of distance; the distance a reindeer can travel before needing to stop to urinate. Today used to describe something that is at a very obscure distance away.
# Poronkusemaa kuukaudessa – similar to furlongs per fortnight
kiihtelys – 40 (squirrel pelts)

skogsmil – Also rast, distance between rests in the woods, approx 5 km.
