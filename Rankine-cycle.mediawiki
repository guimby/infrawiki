The '''Rankine Cycle''' is also known as steam cycle. The Rankine cycle is an ideal thermodynamic cycle that consists of adding heat at constant pressure, heat rejection at this pressure, and  has constant entropy while expanding and compressing.  It is used as the ideal standard for the performance of [[heat pump]] and [[heat engine]] installations operating with a vapor as the working fluid, such as a steam power plant.
