Worldwide, concerns about the avian [[influenza]] [[virus]], which causes varying amounts of illness in [[poultry]], are growing. Those viruses can infect [[chickens]], [[turkeys]], [[pheasants]], [[quail]], [[ducks]], [[geese]] and [[guinea fowl]], as well as a wide variety of other birds. According to the [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]), [[USDA]], migratory [[waterfowl]] have proved to be a natural reservoir for the less infectious strains of the disease.
