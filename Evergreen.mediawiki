'''Evergreen''' refers to a plant that keeps its leaves through the winter. Unlike [[deciduous]] plants that lose their leaves during the cold season, evergreen plants stay green, keeping the leaves intact.

Evergreen plants include both trees and shrubs. You can often work out the fact that a plant is evergreen from its Latin name ''sempervirens'', which translates to "always green".<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen</ref>
