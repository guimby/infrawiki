Some introduction text and background can go here.

==Caba√±as Los Silos, Tenerife Norte  ==
At the moment there are 3 self catering cabins in a certified organic farm.

The land is fairly big with a lot of potential.

We hope to find like minded individuals who may want to stay and discuss development opportunities.

== Project Goals ==
To develop different aspects of the organic farm, and possibly develop a rural community of sutainable travel and ecotourism to make the most of the vast opportunities offered by the land and its surroundings.

== Discussion ==
We would love people with sustainability at heart to visit and help us develop the project.

=== Next Steps ===
Get in touch to discuss possibilities and ideas, or if you are planning to travel to Tenerife,
come and stay with us for a few days.
