== Introduction ==
Isolation is one of the key elements of [[poverty]]; isolated communities have little or no access
to goods and services, and few opportunities to travel beyond their immediate surroundings.
This restricts agricultural productivity, reduces health and educational and limits
opportunities for employment and political opportunity.

Limited financial resources prevents investment in transport maintaining the position of
poverty and isolation. Consequently,
there is a need to develop alternative,
more affordable means of transport

Developing such systems requires
consideration of four key elements:
* the improvement of village level infrastructure such as paths, tracks, and footbridges\
* the provision of adequate and affordable rural transport services
* the siting of services closer to the communities , thereby removing or reducing the need for lengthy travel
* the promotion and use of intermediate means of transport including: pack animals, sledges, animal carts, cycle based transport
and some low cost motorized devices. One of the more common types of intermediate transport is the bicycle.

== Bicycles ==
Bicycles are a low cost means of transport that can improve access to water, health facilities
and, for example, address stove marketing problems faced by woman producer groups in
Kenya.

The bicycle is still expensive for poorer families in Africa and can cost between 20 to over
100 per cent of a rural household’s annual income. Therefore, transport needs to be
supported by an affordable system of manufacture, supply, and repair.

Affordability is related to the availability of spare parts and repair services, which are
sometime lacking in rural areas. Several projects have attempted to boost local economics
by encouraging artisanal production of suitable transport and improve the local capabilities of
metal workers to maintain and repair bicycles and other types of transport.

== Panniers ==
The carrying capacity of the bicycle can be greatly increased by attaching panniers either
side of the wheel. However, the loads in the panniers must be reasonably well balanced.
Panniers are particularly suited to carrying containers such as used for carrying water.

Panniers may simply be sacks or woven baskets hung from lengths of wood or bamboo fixed
across the carrier or may be frames manufactured from wood or steel. They need to be as
light as possible.

The design shown is a steel frame, which may be either welded or pinned together so that it
can be folded up when it is not in use.

The base and sides may be filled in with wire mesh (weldmesh), wooden slats or canvas
type material. The ends can be filled in on fixed panniers but not on fold-up designs.

===Bicycle extensions===
These low cost adaptations of standard bicycles enable larger and more bulky loads to be
carried on an extended rear carrier.

The load that can be carried is limited by the strength of the rear wheel and tyre. A
strengthened wheel can be used so that the limiting factor is the load capacity of the tyre.

Extended cycle user, W
Aloysius Fernando, cultivator of
mainly plantains & peanuts,
sells peanuts in nearby towns.
With the extended cycle, he can
now transport enough to meet
demand (1200 packets as
oppose to 400 packets on his
original bicycle). With increased
business earnings he began to
cultivate a larger area of land
and could hire a peanut shelling
machine.

This particular bicycle adaptation requires; the chain to be lengthened, the brackets for the
rear break to be moved, and the brake rods to be lengthened. The frame does not have to
be cut or modified in any way.

===Construction of extension with small (20”) rear wheel===
The advantages of a small rear wheel are; there is more space for the load, the load is lower
and easier to balance, the wheel is stronger, and the bicycle is easier to pedal. The main
disadvantage is that the smaller wheel does not ride as easily over bumps and potholes.

===Bicycle taxis===
The Bicycle taxi or boda boda has become popular in Uganda and Kenya, they operate for
hire from stands in towns, bus stops and market centres. The name boda boda is said to
come from the time when the East African Community existed and there was free movement
across the boarder between Uganda and Kenya. Travellers were offered transport to the
boarder by bicycle-riders shouting ‘Border Border’ to attract passengers.
Converting a bicycle to a taxi requires reinforced forks, stronger brakes, a passenger seat
and footrests, and cushions. New seat designs enable woman to ride side-addle should help
to improve access.

Although the work is hard, the operators can earn a living despite a lack of formal education.
The community transport organisation in Ndhiwa and The Kibos Cycle Taxi Association of
Kisumu, Western Kenya worked in conjunction with [[Practical Action East Africa]] to:<br>

• enhance the safety of bicycle taxis<br>
• provide a cycle lane along the Kibos road<br>
• set up a mini-medical insurance scheme for passengers and operators<br>
• provide a credit scheme and repair fund for the members
