==Abstract==
This is a 3D printable hand drill which can be used to drill holes in any soft material such as wood. This design is based largly of old antique hand drills seen [http://oldtoolheaven.com/hand_drills/drillimg/d2Alg.jpg here]<ref> Old Tool Heaven: Hand Drill Available: http://oldtoolheaven.com/hand_drills/drillimg/d2Alg.jpg</ref>. This drill is almost completely 3D printable aside from the drill bit.

==Bill of Materials==
# PLA or ABS Filament (1.75mm)
# All of the STL files are [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1182628 here].
# Drill Bit OR
# Piece of flat metal to be used as drill bit (~3mm X ~10mm X ~75mm)

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Knife/Exacto Knife
# Soldering iron (optional) 
# File/Grinding device/knife sharpener/rough stone/similar object
# Flame creating object (ex: candle/lighter/burning stick)

==Assembly Instructions==
===Drill Bit===
# Use a file or other abrasive material to file a point on piece of metal to be used as the drill bit
# Add re-leaf angels to the back side of the taper
# Exact angles are not necessary but try to keep the drill bit symmetric

===Drill===
# 3D print all of the pieces
# Assemble all of the pieces as shown
# Use a small amount of 1.75mm filament to fasten the parts together
# Use soldering iron to secure filament in place this will prevent the drill from falling apart
# If a soldering iron is unavailable heating the end of the drill bit with or other piece of metal with a flame will suffice
# It is recommended to not completely secure the drill bit adapter.(this allows to easily change bits with out the need of a new drill)

===Installing the drill bit===
* CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN HANDLING HOT OBJECTS
# Use a flame of some sort to heat up the back end of the drill bit hot enough to melt plastic
# Carefully align the rill bit with the opening in the bit adapter
# Firmly insert the HOT drill bit into the bit adapter
# NOTE: the plastic in the bit adapter should melt and deform as the bit is inserted
# Hold Dill bit sturdy until the plastic becomes firm
# Allow the drill and drill bit to completely cool before use


== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Estimated Cost About $5
# Typical commercially $35<ref> typical Hand drill: Hand Drill Available: http://www.sears.com/schroder-heavy-duty-5-16-inch-rotary-hand-drill/p-00934094000P?sid=IDx01192011x000001&gclid=Cj0KEQiAnJqzBRCW0rGWnKnckOIBEiQA6qDBapP8w3DtMTMr1-xd6S4gqMdXAwy2psb5TihqM6AHFvIaAmaC8P8HAQ</ref>
