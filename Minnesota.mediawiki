Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Cycling in Minnesota|Cycling in Minnesota]]: Since at least 2001, the state has claimed to have more miles of bike trails than any other in the U.S. For 2010, Minnesota was ranked as the 4th most bicycle-friendly state by the League of American Bicyclists, moving up from its 5th-ranked position in 2008 and 2009. It was only exceeded by [[Washington]], the neighboring state of [[Wisconsin]], and [[Maine]]. Much of the state's bicycle culture is centered in Minneapolis, the state's largest city, but the extensive network of trails has helped make cycling common throughout the state.

:Bicycling magazine called Minneapolis the country's #1 bike city in 2010.

:[[wikipedia:Nice Ride Minnesota|Nice Ride Minnesota]] is a seasonally-operated nonprofit bicycle sharing system in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota based on the Bixi system from Montreal. Launched on June 10, 2010, it served over 10,000 trips in its first month and reached 100,817 rides in the first season of operation. The bicycles in the system are painted neon green and include a cargo carrier and headlights. They receive daily maintenance, and are redistributed throughout the system via truck.

:The system presently offers 1,550 bicycles for rent at 170 kiosks in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. The solar-powered kiosks are distributed throughout much of Minneapolis and western Saint Paul. Bike availability can be checked in real-time via smartphone or an online map. In the long term, the network is intended to cover most of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Nice Ride operates from the first week of April through the first week of November. The bikes and stations are removed during the winter in order to protect them from damage (particularly corrosion from road salt) and make way for snow plows.

=== Open spaces ===

Wikipedia: 
:[[wikipedia:Minneapolis#Parks_and_recreation|Minneapolis, Parks and recreation]]: The Minneapolis park system has been called the best-designed, best-financed, and best-maintained in America. The city's Chain of Lakes, consisting of seven lakes and Minnehaha Creek, is connected by bike, running, and walking paths and used for swimming, fishing, picnics, boating, and ice skating. A bikeway for riders, and a walkway for pedestrians runs parallel along the 52 miles (84 km) route of the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. Today, 16.6% of the city is parks and there are 770 square feet (72 m2) of parkland for each resident.
