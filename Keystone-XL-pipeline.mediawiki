Keystone XL pipeline is a dangerous and destructive project that would pump over one million barrels of dirty "tar sands" oil from Canada to the USA every day. The oil in the Keystone pipeline could poison drinking water, threaten the communities it runs through, and wreck the climate.

But according to environmental activists, <ref> 350.org|Action Alert of July 27, 2011</ref>there's good news: the Keystone XL pipeline cannot be built without a "presidential permit" from the Obama Administration. Let's turn up the pressure to make sure President Obama rejects the pipeline.

Tthe State Department has said it will make a final decision on whether or not to issue a presidential permit deeming the pipeline in our "national interest" by the end of this year. We know more pollution and more climate change are not in any nation's interest, so we’re calling on President Obama to step up and display the kind of leadership that so many people expected when they voted him into office. If we reach our goal of 35,000 signatures, we’ll arrange a high-profile delivery in Washington DC.
