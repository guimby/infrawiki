[[image:pan-stamp-architecture.png|right]][http://www.panstamp.com/home panStamp] is an [[open source hardware]] project created for the enthusiasts that love measuring and controlling things wirelessly. '''panStamps''' are small wireless boards specially designed to fit in [[low-power]] applications, which are claimed to be simple to program and simple to work with. With panStamps, you can measure almost everything by simply connecting your panStamp to the sensors, placing a battery and sending wireless data from the first moment.

==Potential Applications ==
There are a lot of ways I could see this being useful for [[OSAT]] -- e.g. low-cost sensor network for farms,  low-cost sensor network [[energy conservation]] for large buildings, etc.
