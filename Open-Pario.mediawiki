= Introduction  =

The goal of [http://www.openpario.net www.openpario.net] is to create an [[online community]] that is centered around the open and free exchange of ideas. To accomplish this, the Redmine Project Management framework, an [[open source]] project, has been set up to allow users to organize projects and hopefully find other users who may be interested. Initially, most of the projects will be focused on engineering design, but in reality, the software can be used by anyone who has a need for project management software, especially for those projects that are being run in a distributed fashion. 

The open+pario project originated at [[Oregon State University]], and has been a multi-university collaborative project.
