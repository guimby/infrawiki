==Kitchen Performance Test==
Consisting of Household Surveys and Fuel Consumption Measurements, it is conducted when the families have become accustomed to the stove and when the stove has done well with the controlled cooking and water boiling tests. The KPT is done to find the difference in fuel being used by the new stove models and the traditional stoves by the choice of two testing procedures, paired or cross-sectional. By finding out the medium or long term fuel use helps determine if changes are sustained in the long term use of stove and assess qualitative aspects of stove performance, so for about a week weighing the fuel supply each day and checking how many people ate that day.

====Paired Study====
: By doing fuel use measurements of the traditional stove for a week and then doing measurements as the families use the improved stove for a week.  ''This is a longitudinal or panel study.'' 

====Cross-Sectional Study====
:Alternatively, testing can be done by comparing fuel use in two groups of families for a week, with one group using the traditional stove and the other group using the improved stove.  ''This is a case-control study, where the control group is a group of families that still use the old type of stove.''"
