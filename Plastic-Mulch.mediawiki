[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_mulch Plastic mulch] is a polymer film used as ground cover. It is used in a similar fashion to mulch, to suppress weeds and conserve water in crop production and landscaping. The most common polymer used today is polyethylene. Benefits include: earlier planting dates, soil moisture retention, weed management, reduction in the leaching of fertilizer, improved crop quality, reduction in soil compaction, reduction in root damage. Disadvantages include cost and plastic pollution (can be lessened with biodegradable polymers).
