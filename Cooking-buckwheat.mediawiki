Buckwheat can be cooked in various ways. Some are suggested here.

== Cooking buckwheat seeds ==
Here is how to prepare buckwheat seeds by cooking.

# Purchase quality buckwheat. Ensure that it is fresh/within date.
# Select the amount of buckwheat seeds to be cooked. Rinse them in a colander or sieve.
# Fill a saucepan with water twice the volume of the seeds. Add the rinsed seeds.
#*Add a pinch of salt, if wished.
# Heat to a simmer with the lid on. 
# Reduce the heat to the lowest cooking temperature. Simmer for a further 10 minutes. When the seeds have absorbed all of the water, they're ready.
# Remove from the heat. Taste to see how they are. If not quite done, add a small amount of water extra and cook for a few more minutes.
# Serve. They're now ready for use. 
#*If you wish to serve them as they are, they can be enjoyed without adding anything, or you can add some butter, herb butter or olive oil for seasoning. Stir through before serving, if using.
*If you're using toasted buckwheat, the end result will be mushier.
