'''Nature's cycles''', cycles in nature, Earth systems cycles or natural cycles are all terms that refer to the key life-sustaining processes in nature that work in cycles.

Cycles mean that there is a constant and ongoing exchange of elements between air, earth, water, plants and animals. The cycles underpin the ability for all living things continue to thrive and develop.

Through the cycles, the Earth continuously renews itself.

== The cycles ==
The following major cycles form part of nature's cycles:

*The biogeochemical cycles - 
**the carbon cycle
**the nitrogen cycle
**the oxygen cycle
**the phosphorus cycle
**the sulphur cycle
**the water cycle; and 
**the rock/mineral cycle.
*The nutrient cycle (also known as "nature's recycling system")

== Details of each cycle ==

'''Suggestion''': It would be great if someone could provide a brief explanation of each of the cycles separately, perhaps as lead-ins to separate pages for each topic. It'd also be useful to have these cycles discussed in the context of climate change as a distinct topic page.
