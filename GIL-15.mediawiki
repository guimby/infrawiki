Healthcare

How do we provide access to healthcare?

1. Who is going to pay for healthcare - central/ global payor system?

2.Corporations will take more responsibility- keep your employees well; incentivise them

3. Pyramid of healthcare - bottom of pyramid- basic healthcAre should be provided universally whereas top of pyramid can be elective and privately funded.

4.Technology will drive access to healthcare - mobile

5. Healthcare going back to basics at the same time; Simple easy to use products that are cost effective

6. Government believes private is not picking up fast enough. . There has to be better dialogue for public private partnerships. The goverment's focus is going to be for building step-down care

7. Behavior change has to start young- in school

Are we going to live until we are 110???
