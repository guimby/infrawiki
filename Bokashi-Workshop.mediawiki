==How to put on a Bokashi Workshop==

===Preparations at least one day ahead===

* 2 plastic tubs (preferably food grade) per participant;  one for making bokashi;  one for using bokashi with food waste.  Alternative:  one plastic tub (for food waste collection) and one large ziplock bag (for making and storing bokashi) per participant
* sufficient de-chlorinated water (at least 1 liter per participant);  (just pour water out of tap and let it sit for 24 hours)
** or boil water and let it cool down  ... or as last resort, use hot water tank which might already be sufficiencly dechlorinated)
* source Friendly Microbes (commercial or homemade) ... see [[Bokashi]] for list of suppliers;  encourage some sort of co-op or sharing
* source of micro-nutrients: sea-salt or kelp 
* source of carbon:  easiest is wheat bran or rice bran from animal feed store  (suggestion: 2.5 kg per participant)

===Introductory Comments===
* Local governments are beginning to collect green waste incl. meat, dairy and oils to compost them; acknowledge that up front 
* list advantages to handling one's own green waste:
** educational and a "gateway drug" to other composting and fermenting recipes
** in case local government stops collecting green waste, or has incentives to reduce city collections
** less pests, less smell, more ingredients for the compost

===Stories that Motivate===
* The story of how "Effective Microbes" were discovered in Japan
** Dr Terua Higo pioneered the study of multiple micro-organisms ; A mixture he had thrown on a patch of grass (as a failed experiment) became famous; he noticed the area where he had thrown the “waste” product had grown considerably.
* Lakes and streams pollution reduction with mudballs [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2010/papers/S0/S.0.04.Effective%20Microorganisms%20EMTechnology%20for%20Water%20Quality%20Restoration%20and%20Potential%20for%20Sustainable%20Water%20Resources%20and%20Management%20-%20ZURAINI%20ZAKARIA.pdf ref.]

===Teach only one simple Recipe===
* Recipe:  3/4 liter blood-warm dechlorinated water, 3 tsp (15ml) microbes, 3 tsp (15ml) molasses, 1 pinch seasalt/kelp; 2.5kg bran
** adding more microbes and mollasses is fine.  
** Recipe as a ratio:  150:50:1:1  of  bran:water:microbes:molasses
* make sure the water is blood-warm (temperature of blood = 37 deg Celsius) by combining dechlorinated water with boiling water
* mix ingredients together saving microbes for last; then wait 15 minutes
* mix just enough liquid into each plastic tub 
* have participants "massage" the mixture (10 min) until it feels moist enough to almost hold when squeezed together  (30% moisture)
* verify that even the deepest parts of the tub are well mixed
* have everyone squeeze their tubs and put some plastic on top to keep it anaerobic
* advise participants to put something heavy on top of plastic when they get home;  an appropriate sized plate is best
* advise them to wait for 2-4 weeks in the warmest place of the house (or even better on a warm seed-starting mat)
* discuss the indicators of finished , ready to use bokashi:  white fungus  (no other colors of fungus); or one month and no fungus
* explain how to use it:  layer 1-2 inches of food waste with thin layer of bokashi
* discuss advantages and disavantages of drying bokashi (2 year shelf life) vs wet bokashi (2 months shelf life); best to dry in the sun outside rather than in oven where it will smell up the whole house

===Review and Send Off===
* make sure participants understand the different steps and indicators clearly
** must store freshly made bokashi in the shade and in the warmest spot of the house for up to a month (or till white fungus appears)
** at that point, decide if it will get used within a few months, or if it should be dried  (do not dry before this point)
* remind them that if a batch has gone bad (and it is easy to tell by smell), to put it straight into composting 
* they can use any left over liquid as a spray for smelly parts of the house; or directly instead of bokashi on food waste
