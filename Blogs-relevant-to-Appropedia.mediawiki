Blogs and blog comments are an effective way of participating in a community discussion.  If you keep a custom home page at one of the common portals (Yahoo, Google, etc), it's convenient to "subscribe" (using Atom or RSS) to a selection of blogs so you can see new posts effortlessly.  Much can be learned from the variety of viewpoints, and by posting appropriate comments you can also raise awareness of Appropedia's mission as well.

[http://www.livejournal.com Livejournal] has a particularly lively community of bloggers and blog-readers interested in development issues, including development workers; it has "communities" or group blogs; and it also allows registered users to view blogs by all their Livejournal "friends" (i.e. favorite bloggers) on a single page (e.g. [http://chriswaterguy.livejournal.com/friends/ Chriswaterguy's friends page]); it also allows comments to form threads, making conversations easier (and livelier) in comment sections. 

Please add appropriate blogs to the table below, including your own if you author an appropriate blog.

:ApTech = [[Appropriate technology]]
