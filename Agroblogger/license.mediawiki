This page is a record of the license for [[Agroblogger]] (since it's not marked on the site). Frank Aragona stated in an email to [[User:Chriswaterguy]]:

:"I've never actually put a license on Agroblogger stuff.  Go ahead with the CC-BY-SA license, that's fine with me."

CC-BY-SA refers to the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons-By Attribution-Share Alike license (unported)] as used by Appropedia (see [[Appropedia:Copyrights]]) or perhaps to the compatible [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/ United States] (since Frank is in the USA). Either way, Agroblogger content can be freely used with attribution on Appropedia. 

Use {{tl|attrib agroblogger}} to attribute on a page where the content is used. Insert the specific post's url as the argument, e.g. '''<nowiki>{{attrib agroblogger|url=http://www.agroblogger.com/2009/06/30/a-silent-revolution/}}</nowiki>''' - this will display the attribution notice.
