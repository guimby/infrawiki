'''Attribution''' is the acknowledgement of the the author of a work, when the work is reused. 

Attribution is required by most [[open licenses]] ("copyleft"), including [[Creative Commons]] licenses. It is not required for [[public domain]] material, but may still be regarded as good, ethical practice, and can prevents accusations of plagiarism. 

Attribution:
* allows an author to benefit from an increase in their reputation
* prevents others from falsely claiming the work as their own.
* allows a reader to explore ideas further, if they wish, by following them to their source.
