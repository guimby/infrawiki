== Project Description ==

'''This is a solar charger or an emergency light.''' The case design is [[open source]] and can be fabricated on an [[open source 3-D printer]].<ref name="thingiverse">Thingiverse - The Solar Charger/Emergency Light [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39348]</ref>


It runs on a 6660 mAh [[battery]].  The unit mAh measures the battery's capacity and 6660 represents the battery's ability to deliver 6.6 amps per hour.  Amps, is the abbreviation for [[amperes]], that means it gauges the amount of electrons that passes through a given point.  In other words, this battery will be able to provide 24 hours of light source to a given object or space, or multiple phone charges.  To maximize the charging of this device using [[solar energy]], or [[photovoltaic]] methods, the angle of the solar panels can be modified.

This type of technology can be classified as an [[Open Source Appropriate Technology]] (OSAT).  It is available for any user to view or edit,<ref name="thingiverse"/> and it is a technique that is easy and economically used from readily available materials indigenous to local communities to meet their needs.

== Applications ==

There are many ways the solar charger can be used.  Some are mentioned below:

# Charging various electronic devices such as phones, iPods, or cameras
# This solar charger is very portable (200mm/20cm in length)

STL format refers to standard tessellation language.  It describes the surface geometry without any color or texture specifications to the [[3-D printer]] before printing.

== Discussion ==

This solar charger has already been tested and is successful.<ref name="thingiverse"/>
