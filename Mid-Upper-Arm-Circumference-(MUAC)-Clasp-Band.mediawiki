==Abstract==
# Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) is measured on children suspected of being malnourished. The cut off for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is 115mm. MUAC is traditionally measured using a tape measure like device, but there is a need for a simpler method. The "Click-MUAC" concept is for a band that clicks closed only if the child's arm is â‰¤115mm. It is important that this band be accurate, somewhat durable, and very easy to use. 
# This band is easily closed, without pulling the band tighter before it can be clasped.

== Bill of Materials==
# ~1 gram of PLA filament
## [[File:MUAC clasp.scad]]
## [[File:MUAC clasp.stl]]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer


== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# To customize the band, open the SCAD file and edit the band width, thickness, length, and clasp height and diameter. The print shown here uses (all dimensions in mm) width = 10, thickness = 0.5, length = 115, height = 4, and diameter = 4.
# Save SCAD file as STL (or simply download STL given with above dimensions) and use slicer to generate gcode, which can then be printed.
# ~15 minute print time with dimensions given above, 0.1mm layer height, and 50 mm/s print speed.

== Cost savings==
# ~1 gram of PLA filament (at $22/kg): $0.03
# Current MUAC tape can be purchased through UNICEF for $4/50 tapes ($0.08 per tape)
# Clasp MUAC saves $0.05 per tape, and costs 38% of the UNICEF tapes
