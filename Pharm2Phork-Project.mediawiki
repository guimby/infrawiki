==Introduction==

The Pharm2Phork Project is a UK registered non profit organisation created to develop and distribute Open Source Solutions for the agricultural production, transportation, storage and processing sectors.

While our initial projects primarily addressed compliance with food tracability (EU 178/2002 and Sunrise 2005) regulations the scope has now widened to include Logistics, Warehousing, Asset Tracking and Production and Supply Chain monitoring.
