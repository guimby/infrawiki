'''HOWTOPEDIA''' is a wiki for practical knowledge and simple technologies, i.e. technologies that require no complex machine, that are easily explainable and usable by individuals or small communities for a sustainable and ecological future.

There is an emphasis on [[how tos]], but the site is not limited to these.

'''Howtopedia''' covers a similar scope to '''[[Appropedia]]'''; there has been no collaboration between the projects to date but this remains a possibility.
