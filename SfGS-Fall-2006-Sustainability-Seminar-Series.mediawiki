Hi SfGS,

It's time to start planning the Fall 2006 Seminar + Workshop Series.  This will only work if everyone is responsible for organizing one seminar series.  It can be a discussion on sustainability, an MIT speaker, a workshop, or some other way you'd like to get a group of people together to talk/discuss/do something about sustainability.  It would be great if we could have an event every 2 weeks.  To reserve a room, go to [http://web.mit.edu/registrar/www/schedules/asa_request_2007fa.html Reserving a classroom for an ASA recognized student group]

Please sign up below by adding your name to a date (I chose Wednesdays, but we can shift that to another time if that works better for people).  Feel free to add more dates too!!
