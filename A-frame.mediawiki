An '''A-frame''' is a tool used to determine landscape [[contour]]. It is simple and cheap to make, and appropriate to situations where other contour-mapping tools such as [[LiDAR]] or [[GPS]] are unavailable, impractical, or prohibitively expensive. It consists of three straight rods or planks, fastened together in the shape of a capital "A", with a [[plumb bob]] (weight) suspended from the apex. Markings on the cross-piece are compared to the plumb bob line to determine slope.
