== Understanding the market ==

Monochromators are used in optics to isolate certain wavelengths from a light source made up of many wavelengths. <ref> Monochromator Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromator]</ref> Monochromators on the market are anywhere from $2000 to $10,000. Our monochromator is made for less than $100.

== Project goals ==

The goal for this project was to create an easily 3D printed and assembled monochromator that is still relatively accurate.

== Design ==

===Mechanical Assembly Instructions===
#Purchase mirrors, bolts, nuts, razor blades, stepper motor, and associated electronics
#Print files from NIH site http://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-002158
#Epoxy mirrors into printed mirror holders and leave until dry
#Cut 1" by 1" square from edge of DVD-R and epoxy to mirror holder face
#Epoxy 16mm M3 bolt onto end of stepper motor 
#Push M3 nuts into pockets on back of front wall
#Bolt razor blades onto wall with sharp edge pointed into center of wall
#Bolt stepper motor to wall using 4 bolts, with 2 washers under each bolt
#Bolt wall to base with 2 M3 bolts
#Push first mirror holder into square slot on base pointed toward front wall and insert bolt from underneath to secure, repeat with second mirror holder
#Push M3 nut into pin for diffraction grating mount
#Place pin into arms on diffraction grating mount
#Place diffraction grating mount into hole on base plate
#Rotate pin so that the nut side is closest to the stepper motor and rotate the motor by hand to start the bolt into the nut
#Place assembly into cardboard box, mark out holes for motor and slots
#Remove assembly, cut out holes, place assembly back in box
#Tape assembly to bottom and front of box being careful to not cover inlet and outlet slots with tape
#Proceed to electrical setup section

===Electrical Assembly Instructions / Software===
#Wire stepper motor according to [http://fritzing.org/media/fritzing-repo/projects/a/a4988-single-stepper-test/images/Arduino%20A4988%20Single%20Stepper%20Wiring_bb.jpg this] diagram<ref>
http://fritzing.org/projects/a4988-single-stepper-test/
</ref>
#Program Arduino according to the code below:
 <nowiki>#</nowiki>include <Stepper.h>
 
 const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;  // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution
 // for your motor
 
 // initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11:
 //Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 4, 5);
 
 int stepCount = 0;         // number of steps the motor has taken
 
 void setup() {
   pinMode(6,OUTPUT); // Enable 
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT); // Step 
   pinMode(4,OUTPUT); // Dir 
   
   // initialize the serial port:
   Serial.begin(9600);
 }
 
 void loop() {
   // step one step:
   Serial.println("Please Enter Step Value (-50 to 50): ");
   while (Serial.available() == 0);
   int val = Serial.parseInt(); //read int or parseFloat for ..float...
   if(abs(val) > 50) {
     Serial.println("ERROR: Too High of Input Value.");
     goto failed;
   }
   if(val < 0) {
       digitalWrite(4,HIGH); // Set Dir high
   }
   else {
     digitalWrite(4,LOW); // Set Dir low
   }
   for(int i = 0; i < abs(val); i++) {
     digitalWrite(5,HIGH); // Output high 
     delayMicroseconds(500); // Wait 1/2 a ms 
     digitalWrite(5,LOW); // Output low  
     delayMicroseconds(500); // Wait 1/2 a ms 
   }
   Serial.print("Moved ");
   Serial.print(val);
   Serial.println(" Steps.");
   stepCount++;
   failed:;
   //delay(500);
 }

===Calibration===
#Due to the many types of mirrors and DVDs available calibration is recommended
#Acquire a white light source and spectrometer 
#Move the mirror to the maximum and minimum travel and record the prevalent wavelength
#Take additional points if necessary at known number of stepper motor rotations
#Use either a best fit linear line or polynomial to calculate wavelength output vs stepper motor rotations

== Discussion ==

=== Current Issues ===

#Diffraction mount will not actually rotate in current configuration
#Setup in now too heavy on motor side
#Motor is also in the way of light openings

===Possible Solutions===
#For all problems above move motor underneath and direct mount to diffraction mount
