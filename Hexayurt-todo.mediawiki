We need expertise in logistics and manufacturing, as well as '''really''' needing expertise in:

* [[composting toilet]]s
* wood [[gasification]] technology
* cheap [[solar]] system
* materials science relevant to tapes and adhesives, and UV resistance
* solar [[Water purification|water pasteurization]]

If you would like to help with any of these tasks, please email hexayurt@gmail.com.

* Images: how to handle the dozens and dozens of images we have kicking around
** Flickr? - good, but we don't own it, and it's not very permanent
** on the Wiki? slow to upload
* Video
** Same issue; we have a lot of unedited stuff which needs turned into proper video clips
** Then, the hosting issue. We have a lot of hosting via http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?53212 - about 400 gig of storage, and about 10 times that much bandwidth. So we can do video. To a certain extent. But it won't scale against a real spike.
*** Bittorrent?
* text clean up
* Wikitext clean up. I used uneven capitalization in a lot of places. OOps. It should be *all lower case* or perhaps conformant to the WikiPedia norms. Anybody who is familiar with Wikipedia want to help us out? 
** Currently being done.  Let me know if it looks like it needs more after July 28th, 2007.  --[[User:Lonny|Lonny]] 15:58, 28 July 2007 (PDT)
