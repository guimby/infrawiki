Ham Radio (also: Amateur Radio) is a non-commercial radio frequency communication via text, voice and images. In many countries of the world citizens/people are able to get a Ham Radio License in order to be authorized to use distinct frequency bands. There are also satellites in Earth-near orbits for this type of communication.
