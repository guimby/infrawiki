==Abstract==
# Paragraph description of the OSAT - why is it Appropriate? What need does it fulfil? Are there case studies you have found of a technology being used successfully?


== Bill of Materials==
# A small spring is need, which could be salvaged from a broken choke
# A zip tie to hold on the actual lever to the inner tube

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# 3/4" - 16 tap and die

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
# Some skill of how to properly use a  tap and die will help, however the plastic cuts nicely and shouldn't be a problem for even an inexperienced user
# 3D Printing and 3D Modeling

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
'''Printing'''
# To make dimensional changes open and edit in OpenSCAD
# Slicing Instruction
## 50% fill
## Add support to the lever on the beveled end
## Layer height = 0.10 mm
## Speed = 70 mm/s
## Print time will be about 2 hours if all pieces are done together
## Link to Thingiverse with scad and stl files.

'''Assembly'''
# Using 3/4" - 16 die cut threads onto cylinder on main tube
# Using 3/4" - 16 tap cut threads into the nut.
## Ensure pieces thread together nicely when done
# Place spring onto the inner tube and slide into the main tube.
# Place nut onto threads of main tube
# Pull inner tube through cylinder in main tube, place lever over and slide zip tie through to hold on lever

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Incorrectly taping the threads will be the biggest problem someone would occur

== Cost savings==
# Cost to make = $0.33
# Cost to buy = $4.99
# Savings total $4.66 which is a percent savings of 93.4%
