'''Nanotoxicology''' is the study of the [[toxicity]] of [[nanomaterials]]. Because of the small size and large surface area of nanomaterials, these materials have unique properties compared with their larger counterparts. The nanomaterials, even when they are made of inert elements like gold, become very active at a nanometer range.
