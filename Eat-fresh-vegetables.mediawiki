'''Eating fresh [[vegetables]]''' is important for [[health]] and [[happiness]]. The [[spinach]] and [[broccoli]] you bought last week have lost part of their nutrients, and will quickly go from delicious to boring to unpleasant, as their flavor dulls then decays. 

Tips:
* If you can only shop for vegetables once every week or two, use this as a rough guide:
** Eat the more perishable vegetables in the first day or two: e.g. green leafy vegetables, broccoli, any [[tomatoes]] or [[avocados]] that are fully ripe.
** Next, there are some vegetables last a bit longer, but are still best eaten soon - e.g. [[zucchinis]] (courgettes), and [[bell peppers]] (capsicum)
** Later on, you can still cook delicious food with your other vegetables: [[cauliflower]], [[cabbage]], [[sweet potatoes]], 
* Grow your own! This is the freshest and most delicious option of all. Choose modest, easy-to-follow plans that you know you can follow through on - a [[lazy garden]], a [[balcony garden]] or a [[driveway garden]]. Try [[three sisters agriculture]], an easy way to grow [[corn]], [[beans]], and [[squash]] (or other [[gourd]]).
