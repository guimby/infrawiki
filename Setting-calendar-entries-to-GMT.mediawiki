When running regular online events with worldwide participants, it can be a good idea to use GMT (also called UTC) as the timezone. This is easier for calculating time zones for different countries, and it avoids anyone needing to know whether it's currently daylight saving in another country on the other side of the world. 

But you'll want to add the event to your calendar as a recurring event - when you do, set the event's time zone to GMT if possible. If you're using Google Calendar, you'll need to follow these instructions:

# Click the gear symbol in the upper right of the calendar page. Choose ''Settings''.
# Under the 'General' tab, in the section ''Your current time zone'', select the checkbox ''Display all time zones''.
# Click on the dropdown ''Additional time zone''
# Scroll through the list and select ''(GMT+00:00) GMT (no daylight saving)'' 
# Click ''Save'' at the bottom.

From now on, if you add an event and click "Time zone," GMT (no daylight saving) will be one of your options.
