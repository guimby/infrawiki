The manure biodigester at [[Rancho Mastatal]] converts animal waste into fertilizer and cooking fuel. It also provides extra waste material to the nearby [[Rancho Mastatal biodigester toilets|floating drum biodigester toilets]] if the biodigester toilet use is not frequent enough to keep the drum functioning.

==Components==
The table below describes the various components of the manure biodigester.

| The first step of the process is to collect manure and add water. The manure is placed in drums above the biodigester at a 36:1 water to manure ratio. It then drains from these drums down to a series of settling tanks.

| This image shows the settling tanks. The settling tanks let the solids rise to the top. The solids are collected and placed into a composting basin, while the liquids drain to the biodigester bag. If more material is needed in the nearby [[Rancho Mastatal biodigester toilets| floating drum biodigester tank]], then the liquids are diverted to that tank.

| This image shows the biodigester bag. The liquids from the settling tanks are drained into this bag, where they are anaerobically digested into liquid fertilizer and produce methane.

| Methane is collected from the anaerobic digestion and piped to the kitchen. This is a bucket between the biodigester and the kitchen used to catch liquid particles that make it through the pipe.

| At the kitchen the methane is used for low heat cooking. The gas should also go through a scrub before it reaches the kitchen to eliminate toxic sulfur dioxide.
