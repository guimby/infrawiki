'''Buddleja davidii''', also known as buddleia or the butterfly bush, is a fast-growing shrub commonly planted in gardens to attract butterflies and to provide lovely flowers. It originated in China and is now widely spread throughout many parts of the world. In some places, it grows so abundantly that is is considered an invasive species or noxious weed, so check before planting it in your garden.

It grows to a height of about 4 to 5 metres.

Prune hard in the spring time to encourage flowering and to control growth.
