This page contains the literature review performed as a part of the project on Grid Isolated [[Photovoltaics|Solar Photo Voltaic]] Systems for the course [[MY5490|EE5490]]

Presently, this project is being pursued by [[User:Goutham Vishwanath|Goutham Vishwanath]] and [[User:Malay|Malay Shah]] and they would primarily be updating this page based on the literature review conducted. Please feel free to share your opinions regarding the page in the discussions forum and it would be acknowledged.

=='''Introduction'''==

The concept of a Grid Isolated Solar Photovoltaic system evolved due to the deregulated electricity market operators preventing the prosumers from feeding back excessively generated power back to the grid. This alone is detrimental to the expansion of solar cells into the residential sector. This background work aims to develop a system which would allow the users to implement a stand-alone Photovoltaic system which would not feedback to the grid and be self sufficient to power a home.

=='''Going off Grid - What does it mean?'''==
The whole concept of what it means to take an 'on-grid' system off the grid can be found [http://www.sustainablepreparedness.com/index.php/blog/how-to-take-an-on-grid-home-off-the-grid ''here''].
Some home appliances which can be used for an off the grid lifestyle can be found [http://www.sustainablepreparedness.com/index.php/blog/categories/off-grid-appliances ''here'']
