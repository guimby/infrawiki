'''Planetary boundaries''' refers to a concept developed by Johan Rockstr√∂m (Stockholm Resilience Centre) and Will Steffen (Australian National University).<ref name="WP">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries</ref> It concerns a framework of boundaries or limits for environmental change, aimed at delineating a "safe operating space for humanity".<ref name="WP" /> The boundaries have been based on scientific research and show nine different Earth system processes that cannot be crossed without creating abrupt environmental change that may be irreversible.<ref name="WP" /> In the case of several boundaries, the points have already been crossed and we are close to crossing others.<ref name="WP" />
