'''''Jugaad''''' (alternatively '''''Juggaar''''') is a colloquial [[Hindi-Urdu]] word that can mean an innovative fix or a simple work-around,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jugaad Innovation Think Frugal, Be Flexible, Generate Breakthrough Growth.|publisher=Jossey-Bass Inc Pub|isbn=1118249747|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GU24XFLPAv0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Jugaad+means+innovative+fix+or+a+simple+work-around&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ef2oT-f0BoHxrQfs9ZHzAQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> used for solutions that bend rules, or a resource that can be used as such, or a person who can solve a complicated issue. It is used as much to describe enterprising street mechanics as for political fixers. This meaning is often used to signify creativity to make existing things work or to create new things with meagre resources.

The Jugaad concept can be contrasted with the Western (originally American {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}) concept of a [[hack (term)|hack]] or [[kludge]]. Although in its general meaning "hack" is very similar to "jugaad", a jugaad can be thought of more as a survival tactic; in contrast, a hack, especially nowadays, is seen an intellectual art form{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. Both concepts express a need to do what needs to be done, without regard to what is conventionally supposed to be possible.

Jugaad is increasingly accepted as a management technique<ref>{{cite news|title=Jugaad: A New Growth Formula for Corporate America|url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2010/01/jugaad_a_new_growth_formula_fo.html|newspaper=Harvard Business Review Blog Network|date=25 January 2010}}</ref> and is recognised all over the world as an acceptable form of frugal engineering at peak in India.<ref>{{cite news|title=India's Next Global Export: Innovation|url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/dec2009/id2009121_864965.htm|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=2 December 2009}}</ref> Companies in India are adopting Jugaad as a practise to reduce [[research and development]] costs.<ref>{{cite news|title=A snip at the price|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13754045?story_id=13754045|newspaper=The Economist|date=28 May 2009}}</ref> Jugaad also applies to any kind of creative and out of the box thinking or [[life hacking]], which maximises resources for a company and its stakeholders.

==Etymology and variants==

In [[Urdu]], the word includes the letter [[Urdu_alphabet#Alphabet|ṛē]] in the end making the pronunciation ''Juggaar''. In [[Punjabi language]] it is pronounced as ''Jugard'' or ''Jugaad'',  in [[Sanskrit]] language the word is ''Yukti'', colloquial ''Yugat''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Low-cost vehicle==
[[File:Politicaljugaad.jpg|right|thumb|Jugaad vehicle carrying passengers to a political rally in [[Agra, India]]]]

Jugaad can also refer to a low-cost improvised vehicle, which typically costs around Rs. 50,000 (about US$800). Jugaads are powered by diesel engines originally intended to power agricultural [[irrigation]] pumps. They are known for poor brakes, and cannot go faster than about 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph). The vehicle often carries more than 20 people at a time in remote locations and poor road conditions. Today, a jugaad is one of the most cost effective transportation solutions for rural Indians.

Though no statistical data is available, it is reported that there are a number of instances of failing brakes, requiring a passenger to jump off and manually apply a wooden block as a brake. These vehicles do not have any [[vehicle registration plate]], as they are not registered with the [[Regional Transport Office]] (RTO). Hence, no [[road tax]] is paid on them.

Jugaads are not officially recognised as road-worthy, and despite a few proposals to regulate them, vote-bank politics have trumped safety concerns. The improvised vehicles have now become rather popular as a means to transport all manner of burdens, from lumber to steel rods to school children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://becauseitreallyispersonal.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/india-school-bus-tricycle.jpg|title=Bal Mandir Public School Transportation}}</ref> For safety reasons the government of India has officially banned Jugaad vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Govt issues order to seize jugaads|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-21/jaipur/28116564_1_jugaads-govt-issues-order-transport|work=The Times of India|publisher=indiatimes.com|accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref>

==Vehicle variants==

A variant of the Jugaad vehicle in [[Tamil Nadu]] in South India is the ''Meen Body Vandi.''  This roughly translates to "fish bed vehicle" because they originated among local fishermen who needed a quick and cheap transport system to transport fish. It is a motorised tri-wheeler (derived from the non-motorized variant)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiantriporteurs.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/a7.jpg|title=Indian Tripurteurs A7}}</ref> with a heavy-duty suspension and a motorcycle engine—typically recycled from Czech [[Yezdi]] or [[Royal Enfield Bullet|Enfield bullet]] vehicles. Its origins are typical of other ''Jugaadu'' innovations—dead fish are typically considered unhygienic, and vehicles that carry them cannot be typically used to carry anything else. Similar vehicles can be found throughout much of Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/motor_tricycle-showroom.html|title=Motor Tricycle-Motor Tricycle Manufacturers, Suppliers and Exporters on alibaba.com}}</ref>
