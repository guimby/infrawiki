|-
|Arrow arum
|''Peltandra virginica''{{w|Peltandra}}
|12
|Full sun to partial shade. High wildlife value. Foliage and rootstocks are not eaten by geese or muskrats. Slow grower. pH: 5.0-6.5.
|-
|Arrowhead/duck potato
|''[[Sagittaria latifolia]]{{w|Sagittaria latifolia}}''
|12
|Aggressive colonizer. Mallards and muskrats can rapidly consume tubers. Loses much water through transpiration.
|-
|Common three-square bulrush
|''Scirpus pungens''{{w|Scirpus}}
|6
|Fast colonizer. Can tolerate periods of dryness. High metal removal. High waterfowl and songbird value.
|-
|Softstem bulrush
|''Scirpus validus''{{w|Scirpus}}
|12
|Aggressive colonizer. Full sun. High pollutant removal. Provides food and cover for many species. of birds. pH: 6.5-8.5.
|-
|Blue flag iris
|''[[Iris versicolor]]{{w|Iris versicolor}}''
|6
|Attractive flowers. Can tolerate partial shade but requires full sun to flower. Prefers acidic soil. Tolerant of high nutrient levels. Maximum water depth varies from 3 to 6 inches.
|-
|Broad-leaved cattail<ref name="stormwater">Not recommended for stormwater wetlands because they are highly invasive, but can be used in treatment wetlands if approved by regulatory agencies.</ref>
|''[[Typha latifolia]]{{w|Typha latifolia}}''
|18
|Aggressive. Tubers eaten by muskrat and beaver. High pollutant treatment, pH: 3.0-8.5. Maximum water depth varies from 12 to 18 inches.
|-
|Narrow-leaved cattail<ref name="stormwater"/>
|''[[Typha angustifolia]]{{w|Typha angustifolia}}''
|12
|Aggressive. Tubers eaten by muskrat and beaver. Tolerates brackish water. pH : 3.7-8.5.
|-
|Reed canary grass
|''Phalaris arundinocea''{{w|Reed canary grass}}
|6
|Grows on exposed areas and in shallow water. Good ground cover for berms.
|-
|Lizard's tail
|''[[Saururus cernuus]]{{w|Saururus cernuus}}''
|6
|Rapid grower. Shade tolerant. Low wildlife value except for wood ducks.
|-
|Pickerelweed
|''Pontedaria cordata''{{w|Pontederia}}
|12
|Full sun to partial shade. Moderate wildlife value. Nectar for butterflies. pH: 6.0-8.0.
|-
|Common reed<ref name="stormwater"/>
|''[[Phragmites australis]]{{w|Phragmites australis}}''
|3
|Highly invasive; considered a pest species in many states. Poor wildlife value. pH: 3.7-8.0.
|-
|Soft rush
|''[[Juncus effusus]]{{w|Juncus effusus}}''
|3
|Tolerates wet or dry conditions. Food for birds. Often grows in tussocks or hummocks.
|-
|Spikerush
|''[[Eleocharis palustris]]{{w|Eleocharis palustris}}''
|3
|Tolerates partial shade.
|-
|Sedges
|''Carex spp.''{{w|Carex}}
|3
|Many wetland and several upland species. High wildlife value for waterfowl and songbirds.
|-
|Spatterdock
|''[[Nuphar luteum]]{{w|Nuphar luteum}}''
|60
|Tolerant of fluctuating water levels. Moderate food value for wildlife, high cover value. Tolerates acidic water (to pH 5.0). Maximum water depth is 60 inches, but must be in at least 24 inches.
|-
|Sweet flag
|''[[Acorus calamus]]{{w|Acorus calamus}}''
|3
|Produces distinctive flowers. Not a rapid colonizer. Tolerates acidic conditions. Tolerant of dry periods and partial shade. Low wildlife value.
|-
|Wild rice
|''[[Zizania aquatica]]{{w|Zizania aquatica}}''
|12
|Requires full sun. High wildlife value (seeds, plant parts, and rootstocks are food for birds). Eaten by muskrats. Annual, nonpersistent. Does not reproduce vegetatively.
