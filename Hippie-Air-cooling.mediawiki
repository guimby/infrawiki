{{suggested project}}

I would like to suggest the creation of an air cooling unit based on the Solar ammonia absorption ice maker. I was thinking that a fan of a certain amount of ice would likely keep the container it's contained in cooled and the air there is cold. Connecting duct work to and thru the container  and adding a fan to blow air thru the duct work would push cold air out into the area chosen. I'd probably aim at using PVC drain pipe for the duct work. There are a few eccentricities that would have to be worked out certainly. There would need to be a certain amount of ice a certain amount of air cycled back thru it. Certainly a few other issues but i think this could be engineered to use less electricity than an air conditioner.[[User:Serialjoepsycho|Serialjoepsycho]] 06:25, 7 February 2012 (PST)
