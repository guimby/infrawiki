==Problem being addressed==
Dehydration is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Physical examinations are the most common method of determining the extent of dehydration, but can be subjective. Laboratory tests such as BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and bicarbonate levels are more objective measures of hydration, but require blood draws and can miss abnormalities that are not extreme. Healthcare providers in low-resource areas may not have the laboratory resources to perform BUN or bicarbonate level tests. 

==Detailed description of the solution==
The device includes a hand-held probe with an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. The user can adjust the distance between the transducers, each of which is mounted on a force sensor so that skin contact pressure is recorded and communicated to the user via an LED. The velocity of ultrasound waves through the tissue between the transducers is used to calculate the hydration status of the patient.
