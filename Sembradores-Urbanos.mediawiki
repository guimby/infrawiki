==Intro==
Sembradores Urbanos is a nonprofit [[urban agriculture]] demonstration center and outreach group in [[Mexico City]] started by three women living in Mexico. There vision is to transform urban soil into green, productive, and sustainable spaces.  They opened the '''The Center for Urban Agriculture Romita''', one of the first urban agricultural community spaces in Mexico. The center demonstrates a variety of [[urban agriculture]] and organic gardening techniques as well as serving as a space for workshops and courses.  Sembradores Urbanos helps give talks at schools and businesses, puts on community movie nights, and helped start the [[Barter Exchange Merkado de Trueke]] in Plaza Romita. They also help install gardens in homes and apartments, hospitals, and juvenile detention centers with local volunteers.

==Background==
Sembradores Urbanos sees urban gardens as educational, food providing, therapeutic, and community strengthening green spaces.

There objectives include:
*demonstrating appropriate technologies and integrated management practices that produce healthy foods, while optimizing on the space available in horizontally confined urban areas.
*organizing and facilitating workshops, especially in communities with scarce resources and populations vulnerable to undernourishment.
*design and distribute informative manuals and [[appropriate technology]] kits with info on urban agriculture techniques. 
*coordinating environmental education programs and installing [[gardens]] in public and private schools.
*offering consulting and advice for community urban gardens.
*establishing activities that strengthen the local economy and local markets.
