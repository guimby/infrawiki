'''Conservation biology''' is a discipline of ecology that covers the study of nature and biodiversity through scientific examination.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology</ref> 

Conservation biology is an interdisciplinary subject that combines natural and social sciences and the practical role of natural resource management.<ref name="wp" /> It has the aim of protecting species, habitats and ecosystems.<ref name="wp" /> Through studies of human interactions with the environment, the discipline aims to find ways to reduce the impacts of human beings on the environment. This is done by identifying human actions that cause extinctions of species and habitats, especially the loss of keystone and focal species. It also attempts to come up with solutions to prevent or minimize the negative human impacts on the environment. For example, conservation biologists might suggest the establishment of protected areas such as parks to protect ecosystems.

Conservation ethics are, in part, based on the findings from conservation biology.<ref name="wp" />
