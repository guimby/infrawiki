==Design and Printing==
===Design===
OpenSCAD was utilized for Hook and box modeling operations. The MOST-Athena GitHub file repository is located [https://github.com/phidiasllc/athena here]. The Hook and box assembly were imported into OpenSCAD and the part was designed to accommodate the geometrical constraints of the parts provided to [[MY4777]].

rod box is edited from Battery box for AA cells  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:331394/#files

===Printing===
The stiffness of the component is driven by the infill percentage. Adjust as necessary to achieve your desired characteristics.

*Print Parameters Utilized for Hook and Box
**Layer Thickness: 0.2mm
**Skin Thickness: 1.0 mm
**Top/Bottom Thickness: 1.0 mm
**Temperature: 180C
**Speed: 30 mm/s 
**Flow: 100%
**Infill: 50%

==Installation==
The model is designed to add onto the end effector. Print out Hook qty. 6 and box qty. 3 of the STL and install as shown below.
