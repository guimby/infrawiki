'''Plants''' are living organisms of the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] Plantae. They can be divided in [[ornamental plants]] and [[crops]]. Plants can be cultivated [[agriculture|with]] or [[container gardening|without land]].

==Uses==
Besides their initial use (such as for their aesthetic value, human consumption, coloring, medicinal use, and so on), plants can can also be used for other things. Examples include:
* reducing soil evaporation and the providing of [[shade]] to other plants and animals
* work as a [[ground cover]] preventing other plants (such as weeds) from growing on that location
* forming attractive and fragrant flowers and leaves: these can be pleasing to people, and stimulate local biodiversity (attract/maintain pollinators)
* some plants can do the opposite: the repelling of certain insects and some larger animals
* some plants act as [[companion plant]]s: these plants can stimulate the growing of other plants
* some plants (namely, tall and strong plants, thorny plants) when placed in a row ([[hedge]]) can be used to deny (or reduce) access to a space behind it, increasing safety
* some plants (namely, densely growing plants) when placed in a row (hedge) can be used to act as a [[windbreak]] and/or reduce vision of a space behind it (the latter increasing privacy)
* enriching the soil, through [[nitrogen fixation]], organic matter or encouraging [[soil organisms]]
* reducing soil erosion
* generate electricity through microbial activity at the roots ([[Microbial fuel cell|plant-MFC]]).
