**This article illustrates how the guaranteed income stream from a solar [[photovoltaic]] system can be modelled as an investment and how [[P2P lending]] mechanisms can then be used to provide capital for the initial costs. The requirements for and limitations of these types of funding mechanisms for [[RET]]s are quantified and discussed and future work to deploy this methodology is described.
