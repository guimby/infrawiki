'''BOSCO''' stands for '''B'''attery '''O'''perated '''S'''ystems for '''C'''ommunity '''O'''utreach

'''The BOSCO Uganda Relief Project''' has developed a plan to provide internet access and Voice Over IP Telephone access in 20 of 53 of the [[Internally displaced persons]] ([[IDP]]) camps in Gulu, Northern Uganda. These camps were developed with the intent to provide safety in numbers, but the conditions in these camps are inhumane. 

BOSCO Wi-Fi array at Pabbo IDP camp serves 80,000 people with internet access, [[VoIP international phone service]], and educational and economic opportunity.

Sadly, 95% of the people in this area are living in absolute [[poverty]] and are unable to tap the vast [[natural resources]] of the area. Currently, 2 million people are living (and starving) in these IDP camps in the provinces of Gulu, Kitgum, and Pader. The goal of their project, code named BOSCO: Battery Operated Systems for Community Outreach, is to give these forgotten children a voice. This technology will link these people to the outside world and allow them to become their own advocates.
