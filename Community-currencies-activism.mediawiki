*[http://bliive.com/ Bliive], is the first social network for time exchange. It is originally from [[Brazil]], today is established in the [[United Kingdom]] and has more than 60000 users in 100 countries. The platform is free of charge and the company profits from Bliive Groups, a solution for companies, co-workings, universities and schools that want to promote a collaborative environment to their employees and students.

:Financed by the UKTI  and accelerated by Entrepreneurial Spark, the worlds' larger free business accelerator the team has achieved several goals since Bliive's launch: - Creative Business Cup Brazil - Intel Challenge Brazil - Entrepreneurship camp in the Silicon Valley - CEO became Global Agenda Council for Creative Economies, a World Economic Forum initiative. 

:The platform has become popular in Brazil for its revolutionary idea, allowing people that don't have money to study a second language, for example, to do so through the platform. When registering, users are given 5 TimeMoneys so that they can start requesting activities and experiences from other users. TimeMoney is the currency used within the platform. One TimeMoney equals to one hour. Their idea is to show that everyone's time is valuable and everyone has something worth sharing.

:On Bliive users can add their friends, find people near them by geolocation and filter their interests in order to search for new activities close to them. Bliive users can also volunteer in one of the accredited NGO's and receive TimeMoneys in return.

*[https://www.listia.com/ Listia.com], free online marketplace and mobile app for trading goods between individuals without using money. The platform has a system known as Listia credits to facilitate the trades. Users earn credits for giving away items they no longer need and can then use credits to get items that other users have listed. The marketplace uses an auction system where users bid on each other's items until the auction ends and the highest bidder wins. The user who listed the item then arranges for a pickup or ships the item directly to the winner. {{W|Listia}}
