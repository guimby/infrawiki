[[Cold cathode]]{{w|Cold cathode}} lamp

CCFL stands for Cold-Cathode-Fluorescent-Lamp 

This is a new kind of Fluorescent-lamp that has cold Cathode tubes.
Because there is no heat production there is less energy loss.
The cathodes are on the outer end on the inside of the CCFL-tube-lamp.
This tube-lamp needs very high voltage to work; the inverter-transformer produces this voltage.
The CCFL parts are the CCFL-tube-lamp and CCFL-inverter.

Other names for this kind of lamp:12-Volt Heavy-Duty Inspection-lamp, work-lamp, garage-stick-lamp, Fluorescent portable lamp

==Introduction==

A [[Cold_Cathode_Fluorescent_Lamp]] source haves match advantages.
But one big disadvantage is that the  lamp is very thin and need good protection against breaking.

This lamp can have up to four CCFL-lamps and inverters, taken from electronic equipment like old document-scanners.
 

== Benefit tubes in PET bottles==
 
=== Safety ===
-Is more light-weight than the known type of lamp-cap
-low voltage system

==== shape form ====

* Is very simple and fast to make.
* Is very simple to explain how to make.
* Have no sharp edges.  
* Is lightweight  only 0.2 kg, if the lamp-cap falls 
* Outside is made of soft elastic materials.

==== electric ====
* Is watertight.
* No metal outer parts that can conduct dangerous electricity.
 
=== Sustainability ===
* If the lamp-cap falls, the elastic plastic breaks the fall.
* Can survive more vibration and higher fall from heights.
* The lamp-cap is air tight and hard to compress.
* The tubes-lamps are protected against vibration and shocks.
* The tubes have a very long life.
* Insects, dust and water can not get inside this lamp-cap.
* The bottle material Polyethylene-Terephthalate (PET) remains clear and strong for years
* The chips-bag material (Metalized PET/LDPE) remains reflective for years.

=== In Use ===
* Pivotable in every direction.
* The outside of the PET-bottle material is very clear and smooth, and easy to clean with water.

==Electric parts==

== Soldering the electronic parts==
WARNING the CCFL-inverter can have a dangerous high voltage output.
Do not extend the wire between the inverter and fluorescent tube-lamp.
More than one electronic inverter or electronic ballast 
Some type of inverters can feed two or more Fluorescent tube Lamp.
Here is more information where to find CCFL material [[Cold_Cathode_Fluorescent_Lamps]]

===External Electrode Fluorescent Lamp(EEFL)===

EEFL looks like CCFL with external Electrodes

There are EEFL inverters that can feed more than two parallel EEFL tube lamps .

===Tube-lamp-cap with old model fluorescent tube===

Some people want to make a new clean lamp-cap for their old fluorescent-tube-lamp(S) and electronic ballast. 

Clean the fluorescent-tube-lamp(s) for more light. 

With the same building instructions it is possible to make a lamp-cap with one or two old tube-lamp(s) and electronic ballasts.

This type of electronic transformer (electronic ballast) has the same dimensions as a electronic inverter.
The thyristor component does heat up; do NOT let it touch the plastic foil.
In this tube-lamp-cap there is space to make a bigger aluminium heat-sink cooling plate.

It is possible to use a energy efficient CCFL inverter to feed a small thin fluorescent lamp like a T5 model.

A fluorescent-tube-lamp can not handle the heat of tin-soldering.

Tin-Solder the flexible electric-wire to a two self-made tin-plate clamp for every fluorescent-tube-lamp that slides over the two pins of the fluorescent-tube-lamp.
Do not use massive electric-wire
Use very thin metal tin plate.

This tube-lamp-cap design is stronger and is more lightweight than the factory model fluorescent tube-lamp-work-light.
The PET material is more clear and the chips bag material reflects the light better.

 Use Fluorescent lamp 12 INCH or 285mm 12 Volt/8 watt for holder/socket type T5 or G5 

Do NOT use a 110 or 220 Volt Fluorescent lamp

==Assembly==

=== Reflecting chips-bag foil ===


Use Chips-bag material with reflective inside.

The plastic is Metalized PET/LDPE.

This material remains reflective for years, much better than aluminium-foil. 

Test this plastic to make sure it is flame-resistant.

Do NOT use PE-plastic or PP-plastic [[plastic]]{{w|plastic}}



Cut out a piece of the reflecting foil out of a chips-bag

==== Glueing the foil====

Use glue that does not damage the reflective layer.

Spray a thin layer of glue like Tixotrope on basis of polychloropreenrubber.

Put the layer parts together without air bubbles in between.

Roll up the plastic layers so it stays in the rolled-up position.

==== Melting twelve holes ====

===Wrap the foil around electronic-transformer(s) ===

Put the electronic-transformer(s) in the roll and leave the Tube-lamp(s) outside.

[[Image:Binding Tube lamp Stick .PNG|thumb|right|Binding Tube-lamp(s) and Stick|600px]]

===Binding tube-lamp(s) to the Stick===

Press one sate-sticks through three holes of the foil

Bind with one piece of thin nylon fishing-thread the tube-lamp(s) to this sate-stick.

[[Image:Slide the second and third sticks.PNG|thumb|right|slide in second and third sticks|500px]]

===Slide in second and third sate-Stick ===

Slide in the second sate-Stick through one hole in the foil, through a knot in the electric-wire, and through the other holes of the foil.

The knot is to protect the inverter for pulling forces on the electric-wire.

And slide in the third sate-sticks through the four holes in the foil.

[[Image:Three_Sticks.PNG|thumb|right|Three_Sticks|500px]]


Do not bind the a thin lamp-tube to all three of the sate-sticks, otherwise the lamp-tube will break more easily.

With the This drawing is to show how you can use more than one CCFL-lamp and inverter(s)

====Slide in Bottle bottom====

Make a rough surface on the inside of the PET-bottle-bottom, using coarse sandpaper or other tool.


Pull the whole length of wire through the hole in the PET-bottle-bottom and slide in the assembled parts

The second knot is to protect the electronic-transformer(s) for pulling forces on the electric-wire

[[Image:Slide Bottle in Bottle.PNG|thumb|right|Slide Bottle in Bottle|600px]]

====Slide in Bottle in Bottle====

Make a rough surface on the outside of the shortest-bottle-bottom, using coarse sandpaper or other tool.

Slide in shortest bottle-bottom inside the longest one.  (Do not slide the longest bottle bottom inside the shortest one.)

Otherwise the long bottle of the lamp-cap can compress and let air in, which would make the Tube-lamp-cap less stiff

Make sure the coarse surface on the inside- and outside bottle-bottoms are in contact with each other. 

This is to prevent the bottle-bottom from sliding unwanted out of each-other.

====Make water and air-tight====

Glue the electric-wire in the hole in one side of the bottle-bottom with Hot-melt glue or gummy type of glue.
If you take the same size bottle halves it is almost air tight already.
A good air-tight lamp cap is better protected against mechanical compression.
If this kind of lamp cap can be made air tight it can be extremely strong.
