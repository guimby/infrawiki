'''Clean indoor air''' is achieved through:
* Good [[ventilation]]
** Using a [[household heat exchanger]] where needed, to preserve the heat or coolness of the air, without 
** Good thermal mass (part of [[passive solar design]] allows more ventilation while maintaining a [[comfortable temperature]].
* Not using indoor fires. Or if one is used:
** Ensure the [[stove]] or [[cooker]] is properly sealed, allowing air in with no leaks allowing smoke out. There should be noticeable suction where air is pulled into the fire, to avoid smoke coming out.
** Ensuring proper burning within the device, so that any flue that ''does'' escape is fully burnt, minimizing dangerous [[carbon monoxide]] and [[airborne particulates]].
** Ensuring especially good ventilation (challenging when the fire is for keeping warm in winter).
** Don't use more than necessary - wear extra clothing, and keep active - an extra reason to do exercise.
* Minimizing the use of [[chemical cleaners]] (particularly those with [[volatile organic chemicals]]). If they are needed, do it in good weather where you can keep windows and doors open for several hours.
* Indoor plants - what are the factors that make these effective?{{sp}} Particular varieties?{{expand}}
* Avoid the various other sources of '''[[indoor air pollution]]'''.
