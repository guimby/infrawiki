A '''microclimate''' is a local atmospheric zone with a climate differing from the surrounding area. It may be only a square meter, e.g. part of a [[garden]], or square kilometers in size.

They may be created by:
* bodies of water which cool the air,
* dark colored [[hard surfaces]] such as brick, concrete, and asphalt, which absorb [[solar energy]], become hot, and then heat the surrounding air - for example the [[urban heat island]]
* landforms which redirect, channel or slow down the prevailing [[wind]]. 
* slope - South-facing slopes in the Northern Hemisphere and North-facing slopes in the Southern Hemisphere receive more direct sunlight  and are thus warmer.
* walls and buildings, which intentionally or accidentally block sun and wind, and sometimes channel wind.

This is not only a critical factor to account for in [[sustainable design]], but good design also improves the microclimate. [[Permaculture]] includes a focus on influencing the [[microclimate]].  

A walled garden is a clear example of a microclimate, protected from wind and potentially protected from [[frost]].
