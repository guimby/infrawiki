'''Option to Purchase at Agricultural Value''' ('''OPAV''') is a legal mechanism designed to ensure that agricultural land remain available for agricultural use into the future. The option has been included in some [[easement]]s in [[Massachusetts]] beginning in 1994, and [[Vermont]] beginning in 2003. Where the market price for a parcel of land may be higher for non-agricultural uses, it offers an easement holder (typically a land trust, government agency, or other organization) to purchase it at a lower price. The organization may then lease the land to farmers. It is hoped that the option will give new farmers a better chance of accessing affordable land. Due to its newness, the option is largely untested. As of Fall 2012 the option has only been exercised once.
