'''Baseload power''' is long term, continuous and reliable [[power supply]], often supplied by [[hydroelectricity]], [[coal]] or [[nuclear power]]. It is a stumbling block for many forms of [[renewable energy]].



== Baseload renewable power ==

Options include:
* [[Solar thermal electricity]] using molten salt which can store heat for many hours. Already on a semi-commercial basis in [[Spain]]
* [[Hydroelectricity]]. Unfortunately the dams have significant negative [[environmental impact]], also affecting [[fish stocks]].

Possibilities (still at the research stage) include:
* [[Wind power]] storing the energy as air pressure in underwater balloons. Still at the concept stage.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2010/2952227.htm Wind energy - storing the power], abc.net.au, ''Science Show'', 17 July 2010.</ref>
* More cost-effective [[batteries]]
