==Overview==
The [[ecoladrillo]] house at [[Haiti Communitere]] was built using old pallets, plastic bottles, and straw-bales. In one portion of the house plastic bottles are fitted into the center of the walls and kept in place by mortar and chicken wire before they are plastered over. In another portion of the house straw-bales are the insulation layer in the walls.
