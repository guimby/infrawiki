==Abstract==
Monetary and supply aid efforts to third work countries offer a temporary solution to permanent problems. In an effort to provide a sustainable means of income and food, I turned to a now common hobby, beekeeping. Beekeeping provides a source of food to the owner as well as a product which they can sell as a means of income. The difficulty in this hobby is that it is difficult to find the proper resources for a reasonable price. One of those essential resources is a queen rearing kit which allows the owner to properly breed more queeens to maintain their hive. This kit goes for upwards of $150 online in the US and is even more unobtainable in third-world countries. The goal of this project is to create an open source queen rearing kit to enable those who cannot afford it to start beekeeping.The design must be easy to print and match standard dimensions of beekeeping hives.
