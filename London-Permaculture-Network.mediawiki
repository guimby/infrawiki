'''London Permaculture Network''' is a loose affiliation of permaculture teachers, designers, projects, etc, who network together, occasionally meet up and put on or else publicise events through an irregular newsletter and email list, eg, day courses on [[green woodworking]], [[mushroom growing]], visits to the [[Brighton Earthship]], etc.
