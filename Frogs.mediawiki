Quote from ''Commercial Frog Farming''


----


"Raising and selling frogs on a commercial basis has
not proven to be successful economically in Virginia
or elsewhere in the United States to our knowledge.
Although farming for frog legs sounds promising,
operating a profitable frog farm seems to be more of a
myth than a reality. Those few individuals who claim
to be successful frog farmers generally are distribu-
tors engaged in the selling of adult frogs, tadpoles, or
frog eggs, frequently harvested from the wild.

Many “frog farms” turn out to be natural marshy
areas, swamps or shallow ponds with abundant food
and habitat suitable to the needs of wild frogs. At
some frog farms, culture methods simply consist of
increasing the shoreline area, erecting a fence to
exclude predators and retain the frogs, and stocking
wild frog eggs or tadpoles. The frogs usually are left
to raise themselves."
