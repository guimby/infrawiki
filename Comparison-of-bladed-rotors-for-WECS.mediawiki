This article compares the types of bladed rotors for [[wind energy conversion system]]s to allow the selection of the best type of bladed rotor for any given situation. Note that no overall efficiency can be given; instead this can be determined from the moment of force and the optimum airspeed. To select the best bladed rotor for a location, this info can be combined with the regular windspeed at a height comparable to the one of the wind energy harvester; eg 10m).
