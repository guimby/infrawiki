==Water Analysis for Yearling Ponds One and Two==
The information on this page is credited to Dr. George Allen of the Fisheries Dept. from a study done in 1990.

===Facts===
*The effluent entering the ponds from wastewater has been both disinfected and dechlorinated.
*During the winter months the pond never gets below 7<sup>o</sup> c.

===Statistics for the Ponds===
*mean temp= 10.5<sup>o</sup> c for pond one and 10.5<sup>o</sup> c for pond two
*salinity (ppt)= 12.7 for pond one and 13.6 for pond two
*pH 7.7 and  8.0
*Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L) is 8.8 and 10.7
*Clarity (cm) with use of the secki disc 90+ and 70+ for pond two.              


*Pond one is said to be cleaner than pond two because of the higher population of phytoplankton in pond two.
