{{Appropedia draft press release}}

(Intended generic press release, intro for media who are new to Appropedia.)

After 4 years, 100,000 edits and more than 3000 pages, Appropedia has grown into a broad resource for all kinds of sustainability and development questions.

Founded in 2006 by Lonny Grafman, instructor in Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University in California, Appropedia has grown through contributions of knowledge from specialist organizations, academics, students, and private individuals. 

As an independent non-profit run entirely by volunteers, the Appropedia Foundation has relied on financial support from within the community as well as partners and benefactors.
