==Abstract==

#This Stake has been designed to serve as a semi-permanent connection between earth and man made shelter.  current stakes work well but do not take much to kick out of the ground. this can be annoying and dangerous. My design creates an inexpensive alternative to classic stakes. My design creates a better hold and can be made in less than two hours!
