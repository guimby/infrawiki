'''What is The Ecoboard Project?'''     [[Image:eco-board-project-2.jpg|thumb]]
----



The Ecoboard Project is part of [http://Sustainablesurf.org SustainableSurf]an organization dedicated to transforming surf culture and industry in order to help protect the ocean they love to play in. SustainableSurf created programs like the Ecoboard Project in order to engage the public to make more environmentally friendly surf lifestyle choices as well as encourages surf related businesses to improve their environmental performance and encourage customers to do the same. The Ecoboard Project itself helps consumers find alternative ways to surfing by verifying the use of sustainable surfboard materials to ensure a reduced environmental and toxic impact. By having the Ecoboard Project label on a surfboard it is verified that the Shaper of the board has used sustainable materials in order to create the board. 



 




'''Qualified Materials'''     	[[Image:surfboards-kuntiqui-retrofish-2.jpg|thumb]] 
----


In order for a surf board to obtain the Ecoboard Project label it must be made of these materials.



*Resin 

The resin of the surfboard must be at least 15% biological carbon content and low volatile organic compounds. Products that fall under this criteria are Super Sap CLR at 17% and Super Sap 100/1000 at 25%.

*Foam Blanks 

The criteria for foam blanks is 40% recycled or biological content. Products that fall under this criteria are Enviro-foam at 60% by Marko Foam Blanks.

*Wood

Wood is a non-toxic renewable material. Wood can also significantly displace the amount of foam or resin used in order to make a surfboard reducing the environmental impact.









'''Ecoboard Standards'''      	[[Image:art.ecoboard.jpg|thumb]] 
----

Ecoboards themselves are held up to a certain standard and are defined by these three concepts:



# Performance- An Ecoboard should have equal or or better performance than boards made with industry standard materials.

# Ease of Manufacturing- Ecoboards should require minimal changes in manufacturing techniques so early adoption by industries are possible.

# Environmental Benefits- Ecoboards must have significant and meaningful reduction in environmental impact, measured by CO2 emissions and toxic chemical emissions.
