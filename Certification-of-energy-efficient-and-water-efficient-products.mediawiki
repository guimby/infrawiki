'''Certification ''' assists consumers in avoiding [[greenwashing]], and may be provided by [[governments]] or independent bodies.

Certification varies in cost reliability (the level of assurance provided). The best are essential aids to environmentally conscious and budget conscious shoppers; the worst examples are actually greenwashing.

[[Life cycle analysis]] is a key tool in certification. 

Independent third-party verification is an important part of certification. If the testing is done by the company itself, there is an incentive to interpret results favorable, or even to cheat outright.
