#Change nozzle geometry for tighter corners/ better edges
#make drive gear geometry asymmetric to allow faster speeds with the same motor. Align geometry with part to be printed.
#additional infill on edges, leave middle hollow 
#'''add flats to shaft for drive gear'''
#'''mix filaments in print head for color combination'''
#'''mix filaments in print head for combination of material properties'''
#make printer asymmetric to allow better access to print bed
#Change firmware to allow tolerances for asymmetric construction, then vastly increase assembly tolerances
#'''Texture print bed for better adhesion'''
#'''change control rods to linear actuators to allow for additional motion control'''
#add cutout to nozzle to allow other materials to be injected into print stream
#'''shiftable transmission on drive belts'''
#make drive gear geometry asymmetric to allow the extruder motor's force to be better used. Align geometry with part to be printed.
#adjust symmetry of drive pulses to motor
#'''specifically shape print bed for object being printed  (mass production?)'''
#bring nozzle to a point on one side, orient that side inward to allow better detail, shave off the additional plastic on the outside
#flip nozzle in previous point
#'''mount bed on cams, drive them until bed is a set distance from nozzle'''
#'''mount bed on cams, drive them until bed is level'''
#novel print head shape to increase range of movement
#'''overfill inside of part for increased strength (preloading part)'''
#different length control rods for printing on an angle
#flip print bed sideways and add rotational axis
#'''swap nozzle sizes during print to increase strength'''
#change firmware to not care about nozzle geometry, make nozzle from random trash
