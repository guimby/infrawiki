[http://eradicatingecocide.com/ Eradicating Ecocide], supporting Ecocide Law.

:Ecocide is the extensive damage to, destruction of or loss of ecosystem(s) of a given territory, whether by human agency or by other, to such an extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been or will be severely diminished. {{W|Ecocide}}

:In 2010 it was proposed that the Rome Statute be amended to include the international crime of Ecocide. The proposal was submitted to the United Nations International Law Commission who are ‘mandated to promote the progressive development of international law and its codification’. The purpose of the submission was to create the offence of ecocide as the 5th international Crime Against Peace and put in place an international criminal law at the very top level on a par with other Crimes Against the Peace. {{W|Ecocide#Ecocide as an International Crime}}

=== Quotes ===

"I have no illusions that we can simply declare a Law for the Commons.  The very idea and its variations must first be formulated for our modern context, and then fought for.  But at a time when existing regimes of law and governance are in a shambles – losing public respect, failing to meet people’s basic needs, destroying the Earth – I believe that commoning and laws to enable it have a bright future.  Commons can meet people’s needs in fair, open and effective ways, and provide a dignity, respect and equality that the market/state order has trouble achieving.  By cultivating more direct engagement with people, and demanding that they step up to responsibilities, commons also have great promise in improving ecological stewardship."

The Strategic Value of Developing Law for the Commons, David Bollier, September 6 <ref>[http://www.bollier.org/blog/strategic-value-developing-law-commons-final-parts David Bollier]</ref>

:"I consider this strategy memo as the catalyst for a new discussion – and, I hope, action.  The vision is obviously too big for any one of us, or small group of us, to handle alone.  But the push of a few dominos could start a chain-reaction of much greater scale – and as my review of commons-based legal initiatives suggests, there are a quite a few of us engaged in law-related commons advocacy.  Can we take expand this work to a deeper, richer level?"

*[http://www.commonslawproject.org/ Commons Law Project], "a bold attempt to imagine a new architecture of law and public policy that can effectively address climate change and other urgent ecological problems while advancing human rights and social empowerment.  Given the manifest failures of the existing State/Market duopoly to achieve these goals, is imperative that we move beyond reforms of the existing system to instigate new types of governance structures.  We see “commons law” (not to be confused with common law) as a way to integrate a broader notion of economics, human rights, and commons-based governance into a compelling new paradigm of environmental protection.  

:Our book, Green Governance:  Ecological Survival, Human Rights, and Law of the Commons (Cambridge University Press, 2013) provides a full argument for this vision.  It was preceded and grows out of an earlier, unpublished essay, “Regenerating the Human Right to a Clean and Healthy Environment in the Commons Renaissance.”"
