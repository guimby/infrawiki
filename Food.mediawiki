'''Food''' is any substance<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]</ref> consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of [[plant]]{{w|plant}} or [[animal]]{{w|animal}} origin, and contains essential [[nutrients]], such as [[carbohydrates]]{{w|carbohydrates}}, [[fat]]s, [[proteins]]{{w|proteins}}, [[vitamins]]{{w|vitamins}}, or [[minerals]]{{w|minerals}}. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort to produce energy, maintain life, and/or stimulate growth.

Historically, people secured food through two methods: [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]]{{w|Hunter-gatherer}}, and [[agriculture]]. Today, most of the [[food energy]]{{w|food energy}} consumed by the [[world population]]{{w|world population}} is supplied by the [[food industry]]{{w|food industry}}, which is operated by [[multinational corporations]]{{w|multinational corporations}} that use [[intensive farming]]{{w|intensive farming}} and [[industrial agriculture]]{{w|industrial agriculture}} to maximize system [[Output_(economics)|output]]{{w|Output_(economics)}}.

[[Food safety]] and [[food security]] are monitored by agencies like the [[International Association for Food Protection]]{{w|International Association for Food Protection}}, [[World Resources Institute]]{{w|World Resources Institute}}, [[World Food Programme]]{{w|World Food Programme}}, [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]{{w|Food and Agriculture Organization}}, and [[International Food Information Council]]{{w|International Food Information Council}}. They address issues such as [[sustainability]], [[biological diversity]]{{w|biological diversity}}, [[climate change]], [[nutritional economics]]{{w|nutritional economics}}, [[population growth]], [[water supply]], and [[Food_security|access to food]].

The [[right to food]]{{w|right to food}} is a [[human right]]{{w|human right}} derived from the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]{{w|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights}} (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".
