'''Free as in freedom''', or '''FAIF''', is a description or slogan to describe the freedom to use and share software code, written [[knowledge]] or other aspects of knowledge and culture.

It is used largely by proponents of "[[free culture]]", especially by those who feel that the terms "[[open source]]" and "[[open license]]" fail to emphasize this essential aspect of [[freedom]].
