Colonization continues to be blamed for the state of the world's [[poor]]. 

The rich countries in the world today either:
* were colonial powers (United Kingdom) or were no colonial power (Switzerland)
* occupy land rich in natural resources, which until recently was occupied by aboriginal peoples (Norway or Canada), or
* (what's the correct answer here?) embarked on a campaign of modernization? involving government-funded universal education, protection of certain industries, followed free market policies (Hong Kong)...

Examples of former colonies that have successfully developed:<ref>This is a spectrum of course, but it is hoped that by looking at the most successful, we may see some patterns, as well as challenge false generalizations. A far more thorough and rigorous analysis would be useful and no doubt has been done - but where?{{sp}}</ref>
* Taiwan
* Korea
* Singapore

...and to a lesser extent:
* Malaysia
* China
