=Furnishings=

Although electronics tends to take the lead in attention for Open Hardware, furniture is the one area where the largest selection of designs can be found because it is so accessible to designers and because so much public domain design--going back centuries--is at-hand. We anticipate no problem whatsoever in finding open or public domain designs for all the basic furnishings of a home. The only challenge there is selecting designs that are both comfortable and very convenient for owner-fabrication. 

Also, the need for furnishings will be different depending on the choice of home design. Smaller structure designs, as with the Tiny House and Compound House approaches, will be less likely to employ free-standing furniture because so much will be built-into the housing structure. The largest use of discrete furnishing will be with the Pavilion Home design, with most of this taking the form of 'furnitecture' designs defining the function zones of the open plan home space.
