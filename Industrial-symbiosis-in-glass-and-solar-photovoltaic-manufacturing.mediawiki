=Abstract=

In order to alleviate production costs and increase the environmental performance of solar [[photovoltaic]] (PV) manufacturing, an [[eco-industrial park]] for GW-scale production of PV is proposed. This article quantifies the inputs and outputs for the glass manufacturing component of such a system using standard manufacturing techniques. Utilizing [[industrial symbiosis]] in this way, potential reductions for such a plant were found to be about 30,000 tons/year in raw materials and over 220,000 GJ/year in [[embodied energy]].
