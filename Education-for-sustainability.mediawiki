== Eco-Schools ==

Eco-Schools is an international programme of the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) that aims to empower students to be the change our sustainable world needs by engaging them in fun, action-oriented learning. Each school follows a seven step change process and empowers their young people to lead processes and actions wherever they can. Over time and through commitment to the Eco-Schools seven-step process, improvements will be seen in both the learning outcomes, attitude and behaviour of students and the local community and ultimately the local environment. Evidence of success in these areas will eventually lead to a school being awarded ‘The Green Flag’.

Eco-Schools has been implemented in 58 countries, involving 46,000 schools. {{W|Eco-Schools}}

== School breakfast club ==

A School breakfast club is a provision for children to eat a healthy breakfast in a safe environment before their first class. The term "breakfast club" is commonly used to describe such facilities in the [[United Kingdom]].

Breakfast clubs are generally considered to enhance both academic performance and behavior, especially for children whose parents might not otherwise be able to afford to provide them with regular meals. Breakfast provision is however less prevalent compared with school lunch, both in the UK and worldwide. As of 2013, only about half the school children in the UK have access to a breakfast club.

Attendance of a breakfast club is not mandatory; many parents prefer to feed their children at home. The clubs are often run by schools, but can also be community run. Schools themselves are the most common location for breakfast clubs, but they can also be found in churches, community halls or even commercial premises. Breakfast clubs are sometimes open to children from more than one school. {{W|School breakfast club}}
