==Problem being addressed==
Deaths as a result of maternal complications are still a prominent issue in developing countries. Maternal and newborn deaths are high in limited-resource areas mostly because women do not deliver in appropriate facilities and therefore do not have access to potentially life-saving interventions that may be available in clinical settings.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This device features new low-cost ultrasound transducers that create an affordable diagnostic ultrasound scanner. The device includes power-saving battery power, and has wireless connectivity features that allow users to utilize the device in remote locations.
