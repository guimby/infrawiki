'''Prosperity Without Growth''' is a report by the UK's [[Sustainable Development Commission]][http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/index.php] by economist Tim Jackson. It has been revised and released as a book of the same name.

The report proposes twelve steps for a [[sustainable economy]] and argues for a redefinition of "[[prosperity]]" according to evidence about what actually constitutes wellbeing.
