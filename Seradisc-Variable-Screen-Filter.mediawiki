Whatever system of water delivery is used, it is crucial that adequate screening is provided to protect the pump and system. Conventional water pump screen filters offer relatively low performance against the ingress of debris and air which may cause excessive wear to the pump.
Air and cavitation{{w|Cavitation}} are the two things that dramatically affect pump performance and longevity. Air induced into a pump will interfere with the hydraulic action and significantly decrease its efficiency, requiring it to operate for longer periods at an increased temperature and thereby consuming more power and decreasing the life of the pump. The Seradisc<ref>[http://www.seradisc.com/ Water Powered Technologies – the Seradisc variable screen filter.]</ref> variable screen filter has been specifically developed by Water Powered Technologies Ltd<ref>[https://www.waterpoweredtechnologies.com/ Water Powered Technologies – Composite Hydraulic Ram Pump inventors and patentees.]</ref> of Bude{{w|Bude}}, [[Cornwall]], for the protection of water pumps from cavitation and the ingress of potentially damaging particulates{{w|Particulates}}.

== Construction ==
The Seradisc filter is supplied as an easy self-assembly modular pack and includes 16x150 mm diameter discs as standard which will screen particulates of approximately 4mm and above. Screening of smaller particulates is achieved by installing additional discs (available separately) onto the assembly. The maximum number of discs that should be installed using one unit is 42. This will provide particulate screening of approximately 0.1mm and above. Body components are manufactured using ABS{{w|Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene}}, while the flexible discs are manufactured from Polycarbonate{{w|Polycarbonate}}. Connection to a pump inlet hose is by the 2" BSP female adaptor or the flexible coupling (supplied). The total weight of the filter is 1 kg.

== Performance ==

By configuring a number of filters in series, the flow rate will remain the same as for one filter. However, the benefit is that the cleaning interval is increased.

Particulate sizes are calculated. Due to the flexible nature of the discs, Seradisc filters fitted with lower numbers of discs may allow ingress of particulates slightly larger than as indicated on the graph.

== Applications ==

Main applications for the Seradisc filter are with suction pumps and also pumps with gravity-supplied water. The filters may be manifolded in a variety of arrangements. An optional stainless steel screen protector cage can easily be fitted to the Seradisc unit, protecting it from obtrusive obstacles and impact damage. The cage also includes a threaded hole and float, allowing the assembly to sit just below the water surface avoiding undue agitation and ingestion of the lower lying sediment and debris.
