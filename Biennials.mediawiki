'''Biennials''' are plants that complete their life cycle within a two-year period.

In the first year, a biennial plant grows from seed. It forms its roots, stem and leaves. The plant then survives over winter.

In the second year, the plant produces flowers. Once the plant sets seed, it dies.

Many flowers and a few [[herbs]] are biennials, such as foxgloves, poppies, angelica, [[parsley]] and hollyhocks.
