===Accuracy/Reproducibility Protocol:===
====Using a iM01 My Weigh Hich Precision Scale====
AFTER CALIBRATION
#Use a liquid with a known density (water) to test this.
#Put some water in the syringe.
#Push out 5mL of water onto a scale. Record the mass in grams.
#Repeat step 3 nine more times.
#Calculate the volume of water that came out each trial. (Volume = Mass/Density)
#Compare each trial the volume of each trial to 5mL. Reproducibility = Actual/Theoretical x 100%
