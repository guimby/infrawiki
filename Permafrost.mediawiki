'''Permafrost''' (or cryotic soil) refers to soil or bedrock that is constantly frozen over a long timescale. This timescale is a minimum of two years or more.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost</ref> 

Permafrost often contains ice within pore spaces and the changes in this ice impact the ground through the contraction and expansion processes, causing the ground beneath to move slowly.

The permafrost is in an area too cold for tree growth and usually marks the end of forest areas.
