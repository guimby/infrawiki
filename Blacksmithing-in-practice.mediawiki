This article is intented to provide a bit more practical information than what is available at [[Blacksmithing]]. In time, the two articles may perhaps be merged.

For blacksmithing, lower temperatures (than what is common with ie [[casting]]) can be used ie for iron:
* 430°C (soft red) --> hardening carbonsteel
* 870°C (red) --> bending, light pounding
* 1100°C (bright yellow) --> most forging work
* 1600° --> welding heat (comparable to melting heat, ie 1535°C)<ref>Practical Projects for the Blacksmith by Ted Tucker</ref>
