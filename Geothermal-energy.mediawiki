== Introduction ==
Geothermal energy is just one of many renewable or sustainable sources of energy that is getting a lot of focus today.Geothermal energy is heat harnessed from the Earth. Deep inside the Earth lies hot water and steam that can be used to heat our homes and businesses and generate electricity cleanly and efficiently. It's called geothermal energy -- from the Greek words geo, or "earth," and therme, meaning "heat.". Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles beneath the Earth's surface, and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma.

In the United States, most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are located in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity. Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbine/generator, while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine. Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat. Direct-use applications include heating buildings, growing plants in greenhouses, drying crops, heating water at fish farms, and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk.

== Understanding the Market ==
This is where you can describe what already exists, what is needed, etc.  You may want to include inline references. <ref> You can use the ref code to include inline references.  See [[Help:Footnotes]] for more.</ref>

To make bullets use the asterisk:
* Like this
* and like this
** and two for the next indent
* and back to one...

== Project Goals ==
Describe project goals here.

To make a numbered list use the pound sign:
# Like this
# and like this
# See [[Help:Contents]] for more formatting code.

== Design ==
