http://www.leafforlife.org/

www.leafforlife.org is a place to find information about [[leaf crops]] and about the people working with them. There is a leaf library, full of useful and hard-to-find information, including manuals in both English and Spanish. You'll find out which are the best leaves and how to grow or buy them, and how to prepare or preserve them. There is also plenty of information on how to make your garden a better source of the nutrition. Educators can find puzzles and games related to nutrition. We hope this web site will become an open forum that you can join by sharing useful experiences you've had working with vegetables and sending us ideas, recipes, and articles.
