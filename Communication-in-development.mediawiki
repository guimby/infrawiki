[[International development]] and [[community development]] are not activities that are "done to" target people and communities. Rather, [[participation in development]] (including [[community participation in development]]) is critical to lasting success, and communication is one of the key feature of this participation, especially in its early stages.

Cross-cultural communication is very important, and a potential breaking point for projects and relationships.

[[Appropedia]]'s  [[Country Guides]] will help to prepare the [[aid or development worker]] to be effective in a new environment. Please help to build these guides.
