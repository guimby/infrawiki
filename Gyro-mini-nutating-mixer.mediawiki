==Abstract==
it is an ideal for mixing samples in blood and centrifuge tubes.  The 3D printed mixer is a lot cheaper than that available in market.
Its almost 95% cheaper than that available commercially.

Gyratory action provides gentle, thorough mixing
#Ideal for mixing samples in blood and centrifuge tubes
#Fixed speed and pitch
#Safe for cold room use

==Materials Needed==

# M3 16 mm screws and nuts : 10
# 12 V dc motor : 1
# Roller skateboard bearings : 2
# Eraser : 2


==Items to 3D Print== 
All STL files are available here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1195550
# cover 
# test tube bed 
# motor
# gear with bearing
# gear base
# Motor mount
# rotating rod
# rubber pad( with ninjaflex not pla)
# X shape

==Instructions==
# Print all the parts mentioned above.
# After printing the gear with bearing, attach the bearings in the space available.(Snap fit should do)
# While printing the gear base , pause it at height of 43 mm , insert the gear with bearing print and resume your print. This way your gear is secured to a place and will not move.
#Attach the shaft of the motor with the motor gear and secure the assembly to the motor mount.
#Take the motor mount , and adjust it on the gear base , such that both the gears are meshing completely. Then fix the motor mount at that point with nuts and bolts , or epoxy.
# Print the rotating rod and fix it with the printed X shape using nut and bolt.
# Fix the assembly of X shape and rod with the test tube bed with nuts and bolt. You may have to dril the exact location with 3 mm drill.
# Print the rubber pad with ninjaflex filament and attach it with the testtube bed using glue or nuts and bolts. Any one would work well.
#Print the case in two parts and attach them together.Glue 2 Erasers at the point where the cover is open leaving 8mm gap between them
# Place a switch in the hole given and solder it to the motor and adapter all in series.
# Attach the printed case with the gear base and fix it with nuts and bolts.
# Pass the rotating rod assembly through the gap between the erasers and fix it on the gear with bearing assembly.
#You are good to go. just turn the switch on and off and see the mixer work.

==Cost==
# Nuts and bolts - Approx 5 $
# Filament - Approx 10$
# Bearings ( Skateboard bearings )  : 2.5 $
# Motor : 12 $
# Batter or adapter : 6$

Total cost : 36 $

==Notes==
# You can print the cover as one print. just modify the design and join both the file to make it sturdy.
 Due to time issues i printed it in 2 parts.
