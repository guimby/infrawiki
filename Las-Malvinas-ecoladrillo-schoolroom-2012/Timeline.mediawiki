====Jun. 9, 2012 - Jun. 10, 2012====
*Meeting with Revark at the building site to take measurements
*Ideas about new room location are discussed
*Possibility of building two smaller rooms instead of one large room
*Begin soaking paper from the trash for papercrete (later discarded because organic material such as food waste on the paper brought on accelerated decomposition)

====Jun. 15, 2012====
*First meeting with school director to discuss building design and location
*Issues with design/location:
:-New room would block windows of existing room
:-Idea to move windows to north wall is rejected due to importance of opposite facing windows for airflow
:-Close proximity to the bathrooms
:-Blocked on east and west walls by existing structures, which are the ideal walls for window placement
*Decision is made to build a long, narrow, rectangle shaped room in the available area on the north wall of the school
*Possibility of constructing additional recycling structure in the front of the school

====Jun. 16, 2012====
*Begin constructing "labyrinth" of ecoladrillo
*Three more test blocks are constructed
:-Test block #2: 1 square meter 1"X3" wood frame, one layer of empty bottles (size/shape not taken into consideration), open spaces stuffed with plastic trash.
:-Test block #3: 1 square meter 1"X3" wood frame, one layer of empty Dasani water bottles (bottom row full of sand for stability and increased thermal mass), 4 rows of 13 bottles, open spaces stuffed with plastic trash
:-Test block #4: 1 square meter 1"X2" wood frame, one layer of empty similar shaped bottles, less need for trash stuffing due to thinner wood
*Start experimenting with sawdust plasters on test blocks (discredited because the test plasters were covered up by a community member due to miscommunication)
*General test notes: Sand filled bottles are too heavy and time consuming to make, 1"X2" wood requires less trash stuffing but is too weak, over-packing makes plaster application more difficult 
*Finalize literature review and problem definition

*Further testing of sawdust plasters for ecoladrillo:
:-Ratio #1: 3 sawdust, 2 sand, 1 cement, 0 lime
:-Ratio #2: 3 sawdust, 3 sand, 2 cement, 0 lime
:-Ratio #3: Equal parts sawdust, sand, and cement, 0 lime
:-Ratio #4: 1 sawdust, 1 sand, 1 cement, 1/2 lime
*General test notes: ratio #1 is very chunky and poorly mixed, ratio #2 is clearly smoother and stronger within the first hour after application (strong possibility), ratio #3 and #4 are very similar to ratio #2 (decision is made to experiment with ratios close to ratio #2)
*More bottle collection off the street for ecoladrillo (decision is made to explore other bottle collection methods because street collection is too inefficient)

====Jun. 18, 2012====
*Group meeting to break into teams and develop team objectives for the following day:
:-Team structure ([[User:Cep42|Camille]] and [[User:Joce.westcoast|Jocelyn]]) objectives: Re-plum rebar to prep for column pouring, pour concrete for the full height of the 4 columns, remove razor wire and poles from chain link fence
:-Team ecoladrillo ([[User:ers66|Eric]] and [[User:Arieloc|Ariel]]) objectives: Review previous plaster ratios and continue testing new plaster ratios, gather more sawdust from coffin manufacturer
:-Team papercrete ([[User:Shalyn89|Shalyn]] and [[User:Ams202|Amber]]) objectives: Find large source of clean free paper and begin soaking paper with lime 

====Jun. 19, 2012====
'''Structure'''
*Remove fence and razor wire surrounding the building site to make room for wooden column moulds
*Acquire more scrap wood from community members for wooden moulds
*Decide to use existing fence posts to bolster strength of columns
*Decide to drill holes in column moulds for protruding steel wire ties secured to rebar within the column 
:-Steel wire will be used to tie walls into columns
*Begin cutting, bending, and tying rebar forms for concrete beams
*Decide to build 1 beam on top of each perimeter wall instead of  2 (one on top and one in the middle) due to the added strength of the preexisting foundation for the low perimeter wall
*Build moulds and pour concrete for 2 of the 4 columns

'''Infill'''
*Begin mixing and testing papercrete:
:-Test mix #1: 8 soaked and blended newspaper, 4 cement, 2 sand, 1 soaked lime
:-Test mix #2: 8 soaked and blended office paper, 4 cement, 2 sand, 1 soaked lime
*General test notes: Newspaper is much easier to re-pulp than office paper, both tests are insufficiently mixed resulting in strength and aesthetic inconsistencies, over blending of the paper results in minimized tensile strength and under blending of the paper results in greater mix inconsistency, water used in paper blending and lime soaking is sufficient to add and mix in sand and cement (no need to add extra water), both mixes are left to dry in 5 gallon buckets (for lack of proper moulds) and their removal is incredibly difficult (not recommended)
*Further sawdust plaster tests for ecoladrillo:
:-Ratio #5: 4 sawdust, 3 sand, 2 cement, 1/4 lime
*General test notes: Sawdust and lime are soaked with water before being added to the mix, ratio is mixed on the ground with shovels instead of in a bucket by hand (achieve much more consistent mix), ratio #5 is similar in strength and smoothness to ratio #2 despite increased sawdust and decreased cement (decision is made to attempt ratio #1 again with new soaking and mixing technique)

'''Infill'''
*Further testing of papercrete:
:-Test mix #3: 9 soaked and blended newspaper, 3 soaked and blended office paper, 6 cement, 2 sand, 1 soaked lime
*General test notes: Test mix #3 is very heavy (too much cement and moisture retention from the paper), decision is made to experiment with less paper and cement and more sand
*Further testing of sawdust plasters:
:-Ratio #6 (back to basics): 3 sawdust, 2 sand, 1 cement, 1/4 lime
*General test notes: Ratio #6 is the same as ratio #1 but with an addition of lime, new mixing and soaking technique results in much smoother and more consistent mix, higher sawdust content results in much longer drying time (5+ days with afternoon sun exposure and minimal rain)

*Use of the block factory for papercrete is pushed back one day due to insufficient quantity of mix (need 10 gallons of mix to press 4 blocks)

====Jun. 25, 2012====
'''Infill'''
*press first four papercrete test blocks at block factory with new ratio (test mix #4: 4 paper, 2 sand, 1 cement)
*General test notes: First mix is too wet to use (second mix has to made with hand pressed paper), factory workers add a large amount of sand and some cement (quantities indeterminable) to the mix to improve the consistency, blocks break later due to excessive handling while still drying
*Decision is made to sun dry paper before mixing as well as to increase the ratio of sand and cement to paper

'''Infill'''
*Press second four papercrete test blocks at the block factory with adjusted ratio (test mix #5: 2 paper, 2 sand, 1 cement)
*General test notes: Unsifted sand is used without any apparent disadvantages, sun dried paper and adjusted ratio work much better, use of block press reduces drying time from 5+ days to about three
*Decision is made to use test mix #5 with sun dried paper and unsifted sand in final block making '''(See [[{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Papercrete|Papercrete]] for final process details)'''
*Prepare 100+ gallons of papercrete mix for a full day of block making scheduled on Jun. 28
