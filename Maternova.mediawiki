Saving the lives of mothers and their babies by connecting health workers

Maternova is an online platform where those on the front lines of international maternal and neonatal health can connect on issues vital to their livelihoods--within and across countries. We are an action-oriented, global venture that bridges the fields of social entrepreneurship and international health, connecting health workers from around the world to share lessons learned and to innovate.  We feature innovations that are in R&D and those on the market as well.
