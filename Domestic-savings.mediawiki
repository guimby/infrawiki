Domestic savings are a major resource for developing countries. In 2003, they were estimated to equal $2.5 trillion. This dwarfs global ODA, which in 2003 totaled $70 billion. Foreign direct investment, which totaled $152 billion in 2003, also exceeds ODA, as do workersâ€™ remittances, valued at $116 billion. Developing countries must adopt policies that encourage domestic savings to remain in their home countries to contribute to growth and development and that encourage foreign investment.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/2005/53037.htm The U.S. Approach to International Development], Bureau of Public Affairs, Washington DC, September 12, 2005, ([[public domain]]).</ref>
