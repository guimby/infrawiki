== Fall 2008: Full Belly Project ==
The Fall 2008 semester of Engineering 215 worked with the [[Full Belly Project]] to adapt their Universal Nut Sheller in the following three manners:
*Reducing the cost and cement content of the UNS for manufacture in West Africa: [[FBP_LC_Sheller|The LC sheller]] and [[FBP_The_Full_Bell|The Full Bell]]
*Utilizing waste plastic bags to make the UNS molds in [[Haiti]]: [[FBP_Hot_Dang_Plastic_Encasement|Hot Dang Plastic Encasement]] and [[FBP_Pressed_Plastic|Pressed Plastic]]
*Adapting a US version of the UNS to serve as a source of funding and outreach: [[FBP_Nutsy|Nutsy]], [[FBP_Multiplicity|Multiplicity]] and [[FBP_SimpleSimon|Simple Simon]]
