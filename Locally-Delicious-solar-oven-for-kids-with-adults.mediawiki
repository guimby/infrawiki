==  Abstract==
Team Universal Research and Design's goal was to design a solar oven that kids, ages 8-12, could build with the help of an adult.  We were commissioned by the group [[Locally Delicious]] to create this design for their forthcoming book, ''Lunchbox Envy''.  It is hoped that the design will encourage the kids to think about their energy consumption, and make them more aware of alternative, more sustainable methods of cooking.

== Background==
Locally Delicious is a group of women who have strong beliefs in locally grown foods and sustainability.  They also want to educate kids on healthy food options in order to ensure a healthier future.  They are writing a book that aims to educate kids and adults on healthier, more sustainable food options, including information on how to grow and cook all your own food in a sustainable manner.  Part of their book will include directions on how to create devices, such as a solar oven, that encourage people to make environmentally conscious decisions.  In order to do this they collaborated with Humboldt State University's [[Engr215]] class in order to come up with such designs.

== Description of final project==
The final design is a triangular shaped box made out of wood. The seams are sealed with food grade silicone caulk and the interior of the box is covered with black construction paper. Felt weather stripping is stapled along the edges of the front face. Two pieces of glass are used to make a double paned lid which is then placed over the opening, on top of the felt. A cardboard box is cut to an appropriate angle and the wood box is placed within it. Solar reflectors are then made from cardboard and tinfoil, and positioned along the edges of the box to capture additional solar radiation.

== Testing Results==
A test run was conducted with the "catch and cook" solar oven on 27 Apr 2011.  The oven was placed outside at noon, and by 2:00PM high clouds had started to move in, and the oven started to cool.  The figure below shows how fast the oven is able to obtain temperatures well in excess of the 160 degree minimum we set out to obtain. <br />
