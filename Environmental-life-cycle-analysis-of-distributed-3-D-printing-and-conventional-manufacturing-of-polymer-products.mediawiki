==Abstract==
With the recent development of the [[RepRap]], an [[open-source]] self-replicating rapid prototyper,  low-cost [[3-D printing]] is now a technically viable form of [[distributed manufacturing]] of polymer-based products. However, the aggregate [[environmental benefits]] of distributed manufacturing are not clear due to scale reductions and the potential for increases in embodied energy. To quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3-D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on three plastic products. The embodied energy and emissions from conventional large-scale production in low-labor cost countries and shipping are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap with and without [[solar photovoltaic]] (PV) power fabricating products with [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS) and [[polylactic acid]] (PLA). The results indicate that the cumulative energy demand of manufacturing polymer products can be reduced by 41-64% (55-74% with PV) and concomitant emission reductions using distributed manufacturing with existing low-cost open-source 3-D printers when using <25% fill PLA. Less pronounced positive environmental results are observed with ABS, which demands higher temperatures for the print bed and extruder.  Overall, the results indicate that distributed manufacturing using open-source 3-D printers has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than conventional manufacturing for a variety of products.
