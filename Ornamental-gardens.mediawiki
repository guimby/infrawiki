An '''ornamental garden''' can lift the spirits and provide a place to relax. 

But does this mean giving up space that could otherwise be used to grow food? Not necessarily. By growing [[edible flowers]] (for example, [[dahlias]] and [[nasturtium]]s), attractive food plants (e.g. [[passionfruit]]) and herbs with a variety of colored leaves (e.g. grey-leafed [[sage]] and purple-leafed [[basil]]) you can have an attractive garden and fresh additions to your dinner table.

What if you want a succulent garden? Try [[pitaya]], including the large, sweet and exotic-looking [[dragonfruit]].
