'''Reduced concentration oral rehydration solution''' (or '''reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution''') is less concentrated than traditionally used in [[oral rehydration therapy]]. Some tests have found it to result in "reduced need for unscheduled intravenous infusions, lower stool volume, and less vomiting compared with standard WHO rehydration solution."<ref>
[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/323/7304/81 Reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution for treating dehydration due to diarrhoea in children: systematic review] -- Hahn et al</ref>. In contrast, <ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10440307 Efficacy and safety of oral rehydration solution with reduced osmolarity in adults with cholera: a randomised double-blind clinical trial] (CHOICE study group, [[ICDDRB]]) failed to find a difference in cholera patients.</ref>

However, concerns have been raised that this is unsuitable for universal use, as it may lead to a negative sodium balance in cholera patients, with very serious consequences.<ref> [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/291/21/2632?etoc JAMA -- Clinical Concerns About Reduced-Osmolarity Oral Rehydration Solution]; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10440307 Efficacy and safety of oral rehydration solution with reduced osmolarity in adults with cholera: a randomised double-blind clinical trial]. CHOICE study group, [[ICDDRB]].</ref> For this reason [[starch-based oral rehydration solutions]] may be preferred methods of achieving the same effects with less risk,{{fact}} especially in serious cases.

== Composition and usage ==

:''See also [[Oral rehydration solution recipes]] for the conventional version.''


The 2004 [[WHO]] recipe for home-made Oral Rehydration Salts:

Add to one litre of safe water:
* Salt 1/2 small spoon (3.5 grams)
* Sugar 4 big spoons (40 grams)

The standard, manufactured [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] glucose-based ORS solution contains:{{fact}}

In the human body, the [[plasma osmolarity]] is about 285 mOsm/l.

The amount of rehydration that is needed depends on the size of the individual and the degree of dehydration. Rehydration is generally adequate when the person no longer feels thirsty and has a normal urine output. A rough guide to the amount of ORS solution needed in the first 4-6 hours of treatment for a mildly dehydrated person is:

* Up to 5 kg (11 lb): 200 &ndash; 400 ml
* 5-10 kg (11-22 lb): 400 &ndash; 600 ml
* 10-15 kg (22-33 lb): 600 &ndash; 800 ml
* 15-20 kg (33&ndash;44 lb): 800 &ndash; 1000 ml
* 20-30 kg (44-66 lb: 1000 &ndash; 1500 ml
* 30-40 kg (66-88 lb): 1500 &ndash; 2000 ml
* 40 plus kg (88 lb): 2000-4000 ml


== Questions and comments ==
* Perhaps this is suitable when the patient is able to take some other food, and is not relying solely on the ORS? --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] 19:20, 11 May 2008 (PDT)
* In the medical literature available through a Google search, this is referred to as '''reduced osmolarity oral rehydration solution'''. To make it more understandable to the lay person, I've changed it to '''reduced concentration oral rehydration solution''', which doesn't have any hits online. Is there a better term to use? (Or... is it only the salt that's reduced, in which case it should be '''reduced salinity oral rehydration solution'''...)
*...or "''Diluted'' ORS"? Though that sounds rather imprecise. [[User:Steve.mccrosky|Steve.mccrosky]] 21:55, 20 May 2008 (PDT)
