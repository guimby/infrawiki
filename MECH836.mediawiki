[[Applied sustainability]] is the application of science and innovation to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet. This course provides an overview of the field with particular focus on implementation of [[engineering]] solutions. The specific topics to be addressed each year are selected to match the student's research interest and background. Students propose a research project which has the potential to make a significant contribution to applied sustainability. The course then guides the students individually through a mechanism to quantify the benefits of their technical work for applied sustainability, and place it in the context of recent literature in order to implement positive change.  May be given in any term.

Open to all areas of applied science.

The final grade will be made up of 20% homework assignments and 80% final project paper.

Prerequisite: Permission of the instructor.
