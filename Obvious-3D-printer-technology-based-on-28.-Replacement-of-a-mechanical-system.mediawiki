# Use rods that have ball bearings already attached
# Faster electric motors
# Stronger magnets
# Magnetic travel systems versus belt drive
# Aluminum or titanium frame 
# Add enclosure glass to allow for welding spark cover
# Multiple heads, be able to weld and print plastic in one code
# Mounting bracket on base for computer
# Tubing used for wire routing
# Boots to hold in grease on the ball joints
# Adjustable height mechanism, allowing for taller prints
# Interchangeable base and top plate allowing larger diameter printing
# Smaller diameter nozzle allowing greater accuracy
# Needle bearing insert for filament reel
# Bracket that holds filament reel tight preventing sliding of the reel
# Sliding bracket and guide to hold bowden tube at a desired spot
# Quick connects allowing for quick replacement of frame parts
# Quick offset adjustment connected to all limit switches
# Lever detecting bed leveling system
# Glue stick clamp allowing a program to apply the perfect amount each time
# Solid connecting rods
# Replace ball joints with u-joints
# Lexan print bed
# Wireless adapter
# Automatic bearing greaser, activated when printer is homed
