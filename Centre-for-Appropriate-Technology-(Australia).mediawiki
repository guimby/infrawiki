The '''Centre for Appropriate Technology Inc''' is an [[Australian]] organisation based in [[Alice Springs]] (Central Australia), which aims to improve the lives of [[indigenous Australians]], using [[appropriate technology]] to improve their access to a range services. It is controlled by indigenous Australians, potentially an interesting example of [[community participation]].

Its headquarters is near [[Alice Springs]] in Central Australia. 

'''Bushlight''' is a division of CAT that builds and maintains renewable energy systems in remote communities. These are generally standalone [[solar]] (or solar diesel hybrid) electricity systems.  They have a complex but user-friendly interface to help demand management and enable efficient use of available power. As of 2011, 120 systems have been installed across northern Australia, and a version is being tested in [[India]].
