'''Burnout''' is a real risk for [[aid and development workers]], including [[volunteers]]. 

Observation in the field will tell you that it's extremely rare for a Westerner to spend more than 8 years in a [[developing country]] context without becoming bitter. If you want to avoid burning out, spend less than 8 years in the field before you return home (or somewhere like home). Don't even think about moving back for some years after that - even though you may still work in the same area and even pay visits (not too extended). 

Your mental health is precious - don't expose yourself unnecessarily to risks of posttraumatic stress disorder{{w|Posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD).
