'''Leaf compost''' refers to leaves that are allowed to decompose into humus. This may either be done by leaving the leaves in situ if the ground area is appropriate or it can involve collecting the leaves and creating a compost pile for them and allowing the leaves to decompose.

Leaf compost is an excellent soil enhancer for most soil types. It is also easily available and great for the budget.
