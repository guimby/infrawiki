==Problem being addressed==
Women in developing countries are at great risk of post partum hemorrhaging. Due to this, they often have to have blood transfusions which are risky procedures that often lead to death, particularly in underdeveloped countries. 
==Detailed description of the solution==
SpHb is a measurement device that allows hemoglobin count to be monitored. In hospitals where spHb has been used, clinicians have had to perform transfusions 87% less than usual.
