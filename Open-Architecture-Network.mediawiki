The '''Open Architecture Network''' is a free online library of architectural designs. The designs are creative commons-licensed and the site is media-rich.

It is a way for architects (or anyone for that matter) to share designs, including for emergency and [[poverty]]-stricken situations, and for these designs to be categorized, and rated by the community.

The Open Architecture Network was unveiled by [[Architecture for Humanity]] on March 8, 2007, and soon there after partnered with Appropedia to help build sustainable, open source solutions with the world.
