==Introduction==

This is a two tank, gravity-fed rain water irrigation system, using [[Arduino]] as controller/timer. The system can be used for indoor or outdoor production. Bottom tank is "collection tank", top tank is "water tower". Water level sensors exist in both tanks, when collection tank has water, and water tower needs water, water will be pumped up to water tower until it is full.

Plantings are sectioned off into "zones". Solenoids control flow of water to zone (one solenoid per zone). Water is time released according to species in each zone. An option is to place a flow meter in output hose from water tower and release water based on gallons or liters per second/minute, per zone.

The zones are controlled through a web-based software interface (can run online or on local computer) which is connected to the [[Arduino]] controller.

Plants in zones at development site are planted outdoors in typical soil (this is not a fully hydroponic system. It is using rainwater as irrigation).

This same system can be used for rainwater-fed full hydroponic system.

==Goals==



==Best plant species==

Generally, "staples" plant species are not appropriate for small space urban site conditions (grains, corn, high yield beans, etc). It is assumed that for nutritional gain vs. volume of production, that produce (vegetables and fruit) are best for smaller urban and suburban sites


===To do===

(research the yield from different plants). 

==General and future development discussion==

Total Dissolve solids meter looks for electroconductivity based on how much solution powder is dissolved into system (how much dissolved solids are in solutions). This can be useful for fully hydroponic systems.


There are two approaches possible in fully hydroponic system :

1. A chemical control approach

2. A biological approach

Most important to control:

1. Timed delivery of water

2. Temperature controlled delivery of water 

3. Fullness of resovior (how full resovior is?) maintaining a full tower.

What do we need to sense for this?

The simplest control is time and zone based.
