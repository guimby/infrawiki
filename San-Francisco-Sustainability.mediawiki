===Recycling===
San Francisco is proud to have one of best recycling programs in the nation.  Their recycling collection program is “commingled” or “single stream” meaning that all recyclable products are accepted in one bin whether its glass, paper, or metal.  Once collected the materials are brought to Recycle Central, located on pier 96 on San Francisco’s Southern waterfront.  Once recycled, the materials are turned into commodities that are sold to manufacturers who turn them into new products.
