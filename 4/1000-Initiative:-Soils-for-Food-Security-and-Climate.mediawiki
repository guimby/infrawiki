'''4/1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate ''' is an initiative put forward by France during the negotiations for the [[Paris Agreement]] in 2015.<ref name="Initiative">http://4p1000.org/understand</ref> The "4‰ Initiative" (as it is known for short) is an attempt to bring together willing contributors from both the private and public sectors to show that agriculture and the use/care of agricultural soils are crucial in food security and climate change.<ref name="Initiative" />

The 4‰ Initiative is aiming to show that a small increase of 4/1000 per year of the soil carbon stock will improve soil fertility as well as keeping the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees. It is also aimed at increasing the resilience of farmers and farming communities, through sustainable soil management that creates jobs, generates incomes and promotes sustainable development.<ref name="Initiative" />
