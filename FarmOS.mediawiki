[http://farmos.org/ farmOS] is a web-based application for farm management and planning.

It is built on [[Drupal]], which makes it modular, extensible, and secure.

Both Drupal and farmOS are licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]], which means they are open source.

You can host it yourself on your own web server, or you can use Farmier, a farmOS hosting service.
