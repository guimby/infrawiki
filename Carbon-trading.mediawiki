'''Carbon trading''' is a way of putting a price on [[carbon dioxide]] emissions which encourages efficient use of resources in minimizing the emissions, and thus potential gaining maximum impact in reduction of carbon for every dollar spent. It requires the creation of a market for trading carbon permits. 

The '''cap''' in "cap and trade" is the maximum amount of carbon that can be traded. 
 
== Criticisms ==

Criticisms fall into two main categories:
* Fundamental criticism of a market-based approach. This may be for perceptions of equity, or due to a belief that "markets do not work." 
* Criticism of particular carbon trading proposals. In many proposals, the biggest polluters are "compensated" with very large direct and indirect subsidies, which is widely seen as unfair.
