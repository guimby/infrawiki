Several [[plants]] have many edible plant parts, making them useful as both a [[vegetable]] (often the leaves, stems, flowers or flower heads) and a [[fruit]] or [[staple crop]].

==Examples==
* [[chayote]], [[grape]], and some varieties of [[squash]] have leaves and shoots which are appetizing and healthy as vegetables
* Musk Mallow (Malva moschata):  The leaves substitute for lettuce and the flowers and especially the sweet buds are also excellent.  The seeds can be used like a grain, although they are tedious to harvest. 
* Day lily: the young shoots can be cooked as a vegetable, the flower buds can be added to stir-fry, and the flowers chopped into salads or just eaten raw.  The tubers can also be cooked like any other tuber.
* Amaranths have edible seeds and leaves, although most varieties concentrate on one or the other.

==Note==
Some plant parts such as fruits can be a vegetable when consumed before it is entirely ripened. For example papaya. Some seeds can have a different taste when raw as opposed to baked (ie pepper).
