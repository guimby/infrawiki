A '''CrisisCamp''' (sometimes written '''Crisis Camp''') is an event, often at short notice, to provide technical support, usually for [[communications]] technology, and most often immediately after a specific disaster.

For example, immediately after the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the coverage of Haiti improved radically on [[OpenStreetMap]],[http://www.openstreetmap.org] as a result of work done at a hastily called [[CrisisCamp]]. Previously there was a lack of accurate and up-to-date maps for Haiti.
