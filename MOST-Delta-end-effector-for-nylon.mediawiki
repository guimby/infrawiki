====Notes====
#Using a 12V fan on the end effector with pwm. Fan speed too high, end effector would not reach target temperature. Occluded lower half of fan with masking tape.
#First layer too close to glass requiring decrease in speed.
#Adjusted speed from 30% (21mm/s) to 140% (98mm/s) in 10% increments (70mm/s speed set in slicing) while printing first ~100 layers.
#Lower layers exhibited poor interlayer bonding.
#Print is flexible, but makes cracking noise when strained due to poor interlayer bonding.
#Bridging performance improved when speed lowered to ~30mm/s
#Experienced minor respiratory irritation during test. Future tests will be conducted under a hood.

====Notes====
#Using a 12V fan on the end effector with pwm. Fan speed too high, end effector would not reach target temperature. Occluded lower half of fan with masking tape.
#Adjusted switch position (smaller) still some skipping on first layer
#Bridging performance is abysmal. Cura doesn't help it.
#Interlayer bonding improved.

====Notes====
#First print with 24V fan. Too much cooling, occluded fan with tape.
#Part of print warped off of the bed.
#Reduced print speed to 50% (35 mm/s max)
#Reduced acceleration to 1000 mm.s^2
#Reduced max speed to 100 mm/s
*Above done to counter end effector being dislodged during printing, which occurred on two previous attempts.
#Print was brittle and broke easily at sides.

===10/27/15 - Test 4===

[[File:Athena_max333605_test4.JPG|thumb|left|Maxpower 333605 test 4 print result. Note raft used for adhesion. Mirror was cracked when print started, it broke and displaced more due to stress from the print shrinking.]]

====Notes====
[[File:Athena_max333605_test4_cleaned.JPG|thumb|left|Removed from bed with raft and support (top) and raft and support removed (bottom). Note warping - should be flat on table top.]]
#Printed with a raft having no air gap so print is fused to raft attempting to counter warping.
#The mirror was cracked at startup and developed two more cracks during this print. The long crack through the center was also displaced in shear (see photo, above).
#The raft tore off despite no air gap.
#Overhang support was more difficult to remove. It was fused well to the underside of the print. Needle nose pliers were required to pull it off.
