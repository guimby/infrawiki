==Species raised in the Arcata Fish Hatchery==

===Coho Salmon===
*11-26 inches long
*2-8 pounds
*Usually return to stream of birth on their third year to lay eggs and die
*It takes 150 days for the fish to leave the rearing pens, then moved to the yearling ponds.

===Chinook Salmon===
*20-35 inches long
*3-15 pounds dependant on location
*Can be released 4-6 months after hatched, which is surprisingly quick and therefore are cheaper to produce and stock ponds with.

===Rainbow Trout===
*20-30 inches
*3-8 pounds 
*Fed 1.5% of body weight in food per day in the yearling ponds.
*Unlike the salmon, they can lay eggs and not die off afterwards. This allows for as many as three spawnings and the fish can reach up to 16 pounds by the time they are five years old.
*Because of the high appeal for recreational fishing of Rainbow Trout, they are often stocked in ponds for anglers to enjoy.

===Where do they go?===
*Up to 9000 smolts are released into the Humboldt Bay each year.
*5000-20000 trout are released into local streams and lakes each year.
