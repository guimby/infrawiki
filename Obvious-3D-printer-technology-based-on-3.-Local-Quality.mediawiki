#adjust print settings for specified areas of object for tighter tolerances
#'''increase variance on some print parameters (temperature) to allow some areas to be printed faster than others.'''
#use lower quality materials in don't care areas of parts
#change control parameter to pressure instead of temperature for different extrusion materials in different parts of object
#include only high quality parts where precision is important, else use crap quality
#map print bed to account for non uniformity in print surface.
#'''add guards around some mechanical areas of printer to prevent entanglement, leave others exposed to allow open movement.'''
#change frame material from high quality wood to low quality trash as it isn't mechanically important
#'''multiple print heads that are automatically changeable for quality where its needed'''
#use multiple print heads of varying quality in parallel 
#'''alert user when printing difficult sections so it can be closely monitored'''
#'''use feedback to alter print speed based on head resistance'''
#control environment quality around print head but leave print enclosure at ambient
#'''allow for localization of thermal control for print bed to conserve energy and allow for better release'''
#include high precision components for bed leveling, cut costs in other locations
#'''change infill for unimportant areas of print to cut material usage'''
#cool filament before it enters extruder
#'''bigger, sharper teeth on drive gear to allow more filament force'''
#'''self cleaning drive gear'''
#control environment filament is stored in when it is in use
#flash cool filament after it is extruded
#'''add sacrificial edge to aid in print removal'''
#'''use subtractive manufacturing where tight tolerances needed.'''
#'''auto switch filaments to use waste or recycled plastic for infill and new plastic for outer shells'''
#reversable print bed for multiple materials
