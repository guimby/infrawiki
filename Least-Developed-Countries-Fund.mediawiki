The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) is a financial mechanism formed to develop the special needs of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC).<ref name="GEF">https://www.thegef.org/gef/ldcf</ref> It helps to finance the preparation and implementation of NAPAs, to address immediate and urgent adaptation needs in LDCs.<ref name="GEF" />

NAPAs are National Adaptation Programmes of Action and they use known information to identify a country’s priorities in taking actions for adaptation to climate change impacts.

The LDCF plays a role in vulnerability reduction in the areas that are crucial to development and livelihoods.<ref name="GEF" /> This includes:
*Agriculture and food security
*Water
*Health
*Disaster risk management (DRM) and prevention
*Infrastructure
*Fragile ecosystems.

The NAPA implementation projects designed under the LDCF conform to each country’s priorities. They are implemented by national stakeholders and vulnerable communities.<ref name="GEF" />
