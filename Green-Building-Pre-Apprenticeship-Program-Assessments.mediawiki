Each course module in the [[Green Building Pre-Apprenticeship Program]] will have at least one, approximately ten-minute pre and post assessment. This assessment will be taken anonymously (with a secret name) before each module and at the end of each module (with the same questions on both the pre and post assessments). These assessment questions are not the student or teacher grade; instead, they help us assess and develop the program and modules towards the objectives. 

Each participant must use a secret name that they will use on every assessment for the rest of the program.  This consistency allows for a higher accuracy of program assessment. The secret name should be unique and easy to remember, e.g. Chuck Norris Twin.
