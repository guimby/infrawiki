Leather is made from the tanned hide of animals

===Leather Softener===

*1-ounce (weight) [[beeswax]]
*8 ounces (weight) petroleum jelly

Melt the ingredients in a microwave or double boiler. Brush the hot mixture onto the leather and allow it to penetrate. If possible, place the item in hot sun to help the mixture penetrate the leather. Polish the leather with a cloth to remove excess.

===from the [[Household Cyclopedia]]===

Castor Oil as a Dressing for [[Leather]]. 

Castor oil, besides being an excellent dressing for leather, renders it vermin-proof; it should be mixed, say half and half, with [[tallow]] or other oil. Neither rats, roaches, nor other vermin will attack leather so prepared.
