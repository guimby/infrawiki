Lady beetles (Coccinellidae), also known as ladybugs or ladybird beetles, are a much loved garden beetle with predatory habits that gardeners appreciate. Lady beetles will consume aphids, thrips, spider mites and scales.<ref name="Gardiner" />

== Description ==
The adult lady beetle has a round or ovular shape. The thorax is covered by a plate known as the pronotum, and this conceals the head when the beetle is viewed from above.<ref name="Gardiner" />

The colouring of lady beetles varies from the well-known red to yellows, oranges and black. Not all lady beetles have spots; some have no patterning, while others have splodges or stripes.

Lady beetles have wings and fly from plant to plant.
