==Introduction==
Inefficient lighting systems present a number of problems.  Considerable energy waste is common, along with improper lighting conditions, which causes users to perpetuate the inefficiency problem through poor operational practices. 

==General Data==
''General Information''
*Illuminated Area <-
*Required illumination level (delamping potential) <-
*Maintenance and installation costs
