Photovoltaic System on Clay rd Supervisor: Ben Scurfield 

This system has 28 panels and is west facing. The panels are tied in three strings to ensure the 600 watt maximum is not exceeded. A west facing system is less ideal than a south facing system but due to the current building orientation and south tree line it makes the best use of the property. The roof was made out of cement based shingles making it difficult to find proper mounting structure.
