'''Herbal medicine''' is a [[complementary therapy]] that uses plants or plant extracts to treat illness.

==A Brief history== 
The healing properties of many herbs has been known since earliest times, there being archaeological evidence of their usage over 7000 years ago, but the first comprehensive record of plants of herbal value was compiled in the fourth century BC by Hippocrates, the Greek physician known as the 'Father Of Medicine'. By the Middle Ages many monasteries contained ‘Physick Gardens’, where a variety of herbs grown for their health giving properties could be cultivated. The first of these was at Oxford, established in 1621. The Chelsea Physic Garden, set up by the Society of Apothecaries, followed in 1673. The development of printing in the fifteenth century saw the production of many ‘Herbals’, these were magnificent books featuring descriptions and illustrations of plants along with their healing properties and details of their preparation. One of these was produced by John Gerard (1545-1612), who although dedicated, tended to be rather fanciful in many of the properties he attributed to herbs, and many of his more far fetched remedies are still quoted by those who oppose the use of herbs in healing sickness. He was succeeded by Nicholas Culpepper (1616-54), one of the best known British herbal healers. Despite his tremendous knowledge, and the fact that his ‘Complete Herbal’ produced in 1649 is still today a respected work, he died penniless, accused of ‘witchcraft’ by his more orthodox contemporary doctors due to the amazing numbers of cures he effected. Indeed, much indigenous knowledge of native herb lore was lost or suppressed by both the Protestant and Catholic churches during the 300 year period that we now know as the era of the witch hunts.

Paracelsus, a German physician, propounded his ‘Doctrine Of Signatures’ around this time, his belief being that the appearance and general characteristics of a plant gave clues as to it’s healing and useful properties, having been placed there as a ‘signature’ of God. For example [[lungwort]] (''Sticta pulmonaria'') was held to be a cure for complaints of the chest due to it’s spotted leaves that give the plant a resemblance to the human lung. Indeed, lungwort is mucilaginous, and is widely recognised as a treatment for pulmonary complaints. 

===The 21st century===

Indeed, in the 21st century, much herb-lore that had once been held as superstition or ‘old wives tales’ is now being acknowledged as being based very much upon scientifically provable fact, and many reliable published modern herbals are now available. The modern grower can easily incorporate elements of the ‘physic garden’ into their own garden or [[allotment]] by growing a selection of medicinal plants in order to create their own outdoor ‘first aid kit’ which can be administered in forms such as [[tisane]]s, [[infusion]]s, [[decoction]]s, [[poltice]]s or compresses, although of course it is advisable that no medicinal treatment for serious complaints using herbal cures should be undertaken without qualified supervision.
