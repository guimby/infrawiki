'''A Dry Toilet is a toilet that operates without water. The Dry Toilet may be a raised pedestal that the user can sit on, or a squat pan that the user squats over. In both cases, excreta (both urine and faeces) fall through a drop hole.'''

Here, a Dry Toilet refers specifically to the device that the user sits or squats over. In other literature, a Dry Toilet may refer to a variety of technologies, or combinations of technologies (especially pits).

The Dry Toilet is usually placed over a pit; if two pits are used, the pedestal or slab should be designed in such a way that it can be lifted and moved from one pit to another.

The slab or pedestal base should be well sized to the pit so that it is both safe for the user and prevents stormwater from infiltrating the pit (which may cause it to overflow).

==Adequacy==
Dry Toilets are easy for almost everyone to use. Because there is no need to separate urine and faeces, they are often the most physically comfortable and natural option.

Pedestals and squatting slabs can be made locally with concrete (providing that sand and cement are available). Wooden or metal molds can be used to produce several units quickly and efficiently. When dry toilets are made locally, they can be specially designed to meet the needs of the target users (e.g. smaller ones for children). Fibreglass, porcelain and stainless steel versions may also be available. They are appropriate for almost every climate.

==Health Aspects / Acceptance==
Squatting is a natural position for many people and so a well-kept squatting slab may be the most acceptable option.

Since Dry Toilets do not have a water seal, odours may be a problem depending on the Collection and Storage/ Treatment technology to which it is connected.

==Maintenance==
The sitting or standing surface should be kept clean and dry to prevent pathogen/disease transmission and to limit odours.

There are no mechanical parts and so the Dry Toilet should not need repairs except in the event that it cracks.

</ref> ''et al'' conducted a risk assessment of many common components used in [[WASH]] systems.  They concluded that the dry toilet (as a 'user interface technology') represents a '''high''' risk of daily infection for users where the toilets were dirty, much reduced if cleaner and handwashing is practiced.  There is a regular '''medium''' risk of infection for workers who clean the toilets, but this can be '''high''' after an incidence of [[Diarrhea| diarrhea]].  

Given that all toilets must be connected to some kind of latrine or disposal system, this cannot be considered to be the total risk associated with a dry toilet system.
