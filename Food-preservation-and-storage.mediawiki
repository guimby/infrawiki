'''Food preservation''' is inseparable from where the food is stored. The '''storage of food''' is done in a suitable environment. This often means a dry, cool place. There are several places in which food can be stored. These include [[Food storage rooms]] as pantry's (rooms in the house, near the kitchen) or separate food storage rooms (ie above ground, [[Earth berming|earth bermed]], or even underground (ie [[root cellar]]s; store rooms, even mere burial is possible) ). As such, at least 1 food storage technique is often employed (cooling). The following list describes the food preservation techniques we can use:

<!-- List arranged from simple to hard to execute techniques, no or low-energy use for storage to energy-intensive storage methods -->
* [[Drying]] and [[Food Drying with Superheated Steamâ€Ž|drying with superheated steam]]
* [[Liquifying]]
* [[Sugaring]] (includes covering with sugar, making jam/jelly from fruit, ...)
* [[Pickling]]/[[Chutneyfication]]
* [[Curing]] (salting or brining)
* [[Cold smoking]] (note that this requires curing as a first step)
* [[Adding of other (artificial) food additives]]
* [[Canning]] and [[Home canning]]
* [[Biopreservation]] (ie keeping animals alive or using bacteria, ie fermentation)
* [[Stewing, jugging and hot smoking]] (techniques allowing preserving food for a limited duration)
* [[Vacuum packing]], [[bottling]] and [[packing in a modified atmosphere]] (ie ULO)
* [[Refrigerating food|Refrigerating]] and [[Freezing]]
* [[Irradiation of food|Irradiation]]
* [[Nonthermal_plasma|Nonthermal_plasma]] (treating the food surface with ionised gas molecules)
* [[High pressure processing of food]]<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascalization Pascalization or high pressure processing (HPP)]</ref>
* [[Pulsed electric field electroporation]]<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroporation Pulsed electric field electroporation]</ref>

It should be noted however that each foodstuff is more suitable to one or another type of food storage (not all types are suitable for every foodstuff). Tuberous root crops for example are best stored in a moist environment (as these crops are still alive and able to take up water). They can be buried in buckets filled with wet sand and stored below (see "root cellar") or above ground (ie during winter). As each food storage technique requires special equipment, the crops grown in each community are best selected carefully so that as little as possible different storage techniques are needed (hence allowing more cost-effective food storage).

==Examples==
* Canned vegetables and canned beans
* Bulk dried foods such as flour, milk powder, soya powder, whole grains (brown rice, white rice, ...)
* Noodles <ref>[http://www.chow.com/food-news/54453/how-long-can-dried-pasta-be-stored/ Shelf-life of dried pasta/noodles being 2 years]</ref>
* [[jam]] (cooked, sugared fruit, with chunks of fruit, pulp) & jelly (cooked, sugared fruit, strained)
* Alcoholic beverages as wine, mead, beer, spirits, ...
* Frozen fish/seafood/meat analogues (tofu, seitan, tempeh)/eggs, frozen vegetables
* Dried fruit and nuts
* Tea and coffee (unground)
* ...
