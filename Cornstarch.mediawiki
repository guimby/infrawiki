'''Cornstarch''' or corn starch is a natural powder formed from corn, or sometimes from wheat. It is used as a thickening agent for cooking and in products requiring thickening such as those made for cleaning and for body care and cosmetics.

Cornstarch has a useful role in bringing acids to a more alkaline pH balance.

Cornstarch can usually be found in the baking area of supermarkets and grocery stores.
