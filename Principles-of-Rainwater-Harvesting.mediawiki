# Begin with long and thoughtful observation.
# Start at the top (highpoint) of your watershed and work your way down.
# Start small and simple.
# Slow, spread, and infiltrate the flow of water.
# Always plan an overflow route, and manage that overflow as a resource.
# Maximize living and organic [[groundcover]].
# Maximize beneficial relationships and efficiency by [[stacking functions|“stacking functions.”]]
# Continually reassess your system: the [[feedback loop|“feedback loop.”]]
