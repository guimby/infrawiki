==Abstract==
[[image:nopatent.png|right|500px]] 
With the development and commercialization of the [[recyclebot]] (plastic extruders that fabricate [[3-D printing]] filament from recycled or virgin materials) and various syringe pump designs for self-replicating rapid prototypers ([[RepRap]]s), the material selection available for consumers who produce products using 3-D printers is expanding rapidly. This paper provides an [[open-source]] algorithm for identifying prior art for 3-D printing materials. Specifically this paper provides a new approach for determining obviousness in this technology area. The potential ramifications on both innovation and patent law in the 3-D printing technological space are discussed.

==Highlights==

* Rapid expansion of 3D-printing materials for consumers producing 3-D printed articles.
* Open-source algorithm proposed for identifying prior art concerning 3-D printing materials.
* Proposed algorithm narrows the search for 3-D printable materials with specific properties.
* Prior art identified by proposed algorithm can invalidate innovation-restricting patents.
* Potential ramifications on innovation and patent law in the 3-D printing discussed.
