'''CC Zero''' or '''CC0''' gives people who want to give up their copyrights a way to do so, to the maximum extent allowed by law. If you applied CC0 to a work that you created or otherwise legally owned, it is no longer yours in a meaningful legal sense - i.e. it can be regarded as '''[[public domain]]'''. 

Anyone can then use the work in any way and for any purpose, including commercial purposes (see [[non-commercial clause]] for comparison). CC0 can be regarded as the "no rights reserved" option. 

CC0 is a release or waiver, and not technically a license, but is sometimes grouped with licenses as they serve a similar purpose.

== To use CC0 ==

* For online content, follow the steps to [https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/ make a waiver], then insert the resulting HTML code on your site (e.g. on a footer or sidebar). This will display the "mark".
* For offline uses or PDFs, follow the same steps, and copy the text and image.
