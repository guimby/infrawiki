<center>''A tool to aid Salad production ''</center>

I have a polytunnel growing salad. I'd like to reduce the amount of labour needed to grow the salad

== Understanding the market ==

This could be used in polytunnels or outdoors:

* Inspired by farmbot
* Based on a track system
* Seed drills for sowing
* Hoe for precision raking
* Cutter for cutting


== Project goals ==

I'd like to design and build a tool that substantially reduces the labour time needed to grow salad.

# Open Source
# Cheap
# Reliable

== Design ==

* PVC water pipe Tracks will be installed down each side of the bed, screwed in with long screws
* The tool will run along these tracks, pushed by small solar electric motor.
* Wheels will be bicycle wheels used without tyres
* The tool will have interchangable tool heads for different tasks.

=== Sowing ===

Three or four conventional roller seed drills will be attached to the machine. You push the machine from one end of the bed to the other and it plants the bed at even spacing, with a precise width between the rows. In v1 I might just use a commercial seed drill attachment like  [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wolf-Garten-EAM-Multi-Change-Sower/dp/B0001FP946/ref=sr_1_4?s=outdoors&ie=UTF8&qid=1411498618&sr=1-4&keywords=seed+drill this]

===Weeding===

Because you planted precisely you can now attach two or three hoes to the machine and send it up and down the bed once or twice a week. It will miss your crop. In v1 I might just use a commercial hoe attachment like  [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wolf-Garten-DAS-Multi-Change-Miller/dp/B00009Q16U/ref=pd_bxgy_lp_text_z this]

===Harvesting===

The tricky bit!

This drill powered harvester [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DWcY24fBrU looks very handy]  I need to come up with an open source inspired machine that works as well as that.

Currently thinking a beard trimmer motor to get reciprocating motion, attached to a cutter made of razor blades


Then attach it to the 'tool' frame for precision harvesting.
