== Abstract ==

A rapid composting system was designed by [[Engr215 Introduction to Design]] Team 6 to find a better use for the green waste generated at the [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ Humboldt Coastal Nature Center]. Below is a detailed page on the process and cost of building the rapid [[compost]] system.

== Problem Statement ==

The [[Friends of the Dunes]] invites volunteers every week to remove invasive plants in the [http://www.friendsofthedunes.org/HCNC/ Humboldt Coastal Nature Center]. Each week, a volume of approximately 6’x6’x6’ of green waste is generated and shipped off the site to be disposed of miles away. In an effort to manage the waste on site, rather than shipping it, this rapid composting system was designed.

== Description of Final Project ==

The rapid compost system is a three chamber compost bin with no mechanical parts. The structure is supported by wood beams and insulated with beach grass bales. To protect the insulating bales from wet weather, a hand mixed lime plaster seals the walls. The ground under the structure has been compacted thoroughly and covered with wood pallets to prevent the compost materials from contacting the earth. A roof will be slightly larger than the structure, and pitched at an angle, to keep rain from soaking through the plaster. Doors were made from donated wood that slides into place.

|File:Team6pallets.jpg |Three Chamber compost System the 2nd |3 |Find some pallets to build the frame of the composter. Pallets can be found almost anywhere that receives freight. One of the best places to search are hardware stores, who will often give away the pallets for free.  
|File:Team6Lukehummering.jpg |Some picture |4 |Nail three pallets together to make a chamber for the compost. 
|File:Team6singlechamber.jpg |Some random picture |5 |Place another pallet at the bottom of the chamber. This pallet will prevent the compost materials from contacting the ground while also allowing air to enter the compost bin form below. 
|File:Team6threechamber.jpg |Some picture |6 |Because of the large amount of waste being generated at Friends of the Dunes, three chambers were built. One or two chambers would be more appropriate for individual households. 
|File:Team6cutslots.jpg |Slots for door |7 |Take six boards that are about the height of each chamber and cut slots into them. These slots will be placeholders for planks of wood which will make the door.   
|File:Team6drillslots.jpg |Some picture |8 |Drill the boards directly onto the chamber walls. 
|File:Team6woodenslots.jpg |Some random picture |9 |Take any extra pallets you may have and remove the planks of wood. This wood is perfect for doors and will save money since pallets are free. 
|File:Team6placeslots.jpg |Some picture |10 |Place the planks of wood into the slots. 
|File:Team6placein3chambers.jpg |Some picture |11 |Once all planks are in place, the door will be complete. 
|File:Team6roof.JPG |Some picture |12 |Latch on a metal roof to protect the compost materials from rain.
|File:Team6beachgrass.jpg |Beach Grass Bale |13 |Properly insulate the chambers by placing straw bales around the system. In our design we used beach grass because it is an invasive plant that is always readily available.
