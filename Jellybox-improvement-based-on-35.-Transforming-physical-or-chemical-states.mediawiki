##improve resolution (atomic) - (1) higher temperatures, (2) lower temperatures
##reduce parts of the printer - (1) freeze the extruder; (2) heat all the filament at once and pour it into the extruder
##make it easier to use (McDonald's screen) - (1) touch screen Arduino, (2) design the print using a touch screen and a pen
##make it easier to maintain (none, unbreakable, self healing) - (1) filament would be less brittle because it would stay melted in a block, so it would be harder to break.
##reduce waste (zero) - (1) make the printer out of reclaimed wood, (2) make the printer out of recycled electronics. 
##use less energy (zero or ambient) (1) solar power, (2) hydro power
##quieter printing (soundless) - (1) include sound proof headphones with the printer so the person printing does not have to hear anything, (2) make a door to the front of the printer that has soundproof technology so closing the door would create a sound proof seal, and a camera can be filming it from inside to see the print. 
##ubiquitous printing (everywhere) (1) create a teleportation device that sends prints to anywhere
##print smaller (nanoscale) (1) shrink the printer using a shrink ray that will exist soon
##print bigger (apartment complex, Great Wall of China, planet?) - (1) the pouring of the filament makes the melted filament form to the size of the big extruder, so it could be as big as we want.
##enable real-time feedback - (1) install a camera on the printer that can connect to the internet and creates a livestream so people can give feedback as it prints
##make it safer (infant approved) - (1) put a child lock on the printer, (2) create a infant-based learning system for babies to learn about 3D printing so they won't hurt themselves.
##make is smell good (designer imposters?) - (1) add an air freshener to the printer that makes the spinning of motors smell good; (2) add fragrance to filament so when it melts, it smells good.
##make it from current waste products (CO2, flyash, spent fuel rods?) (1) burning trash to produce fuel that powers a battery
##enable ongoing printing without people - (1) use a figure of a boxer with a huge punching glove to punch print off once print finishes, (2) ejecting print bed that propels the print off of the bed, (3) use a "claw game" type claw to pick up the print when the print finishes, (4) two boots that kick the print until it flies off.
