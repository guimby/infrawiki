== Simple Forest Densiometer ==
 Project Developed by Brian Swanson [[User:Btswanso]]

== Abstract ==

* The forest densiometer provides a practical, objective way to measure the density of tree canopy. This tool removes all guess work out of determining canopy cover, which is a very useful metric for foresters and construction companies looking to predict how much foliage and tree removal must be done in an specified area.

== Proper Use ==

# Align grid to the portion of canopy you wish to measure.
# Hold stationary, it is highly encourage to use a tripod with the associated mounts. 
# Count the number of square holes filled over 50%, this number will be the density percentage of the canopy.

== Bill of Materials ==

# The essential material needed to create this densiometer is 44 grams of PLA plastic. At an average price of $25 per kilogram, this part costs $1.10. 
# This part has optional mounting 6 mm bolts. A pair of these approximately cost $1.50. A pair of matching 6 mm nuts will add an additional 25 cents to the bill.

== Tools Required for Fabrication ==

# One 3-D printer capable of printing a 102 mm by 102 mm by 20 mm component. 

== Required Skills and Knowledge ==

# Ability to operate a 3-D printing device.

== Printing and Assembly ==

==== Printing ====
* The print is a single component that takes approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to print. It requires approximately 44 grams of plastic.  

==== Assembly ====
* For mounting, simply place 6 mm bolts into holes on outside flanges and use nuts to fasten to whatever mount you desire.

==== Common Troubleshooting ====

* To remain accurate and objective, clean grid lines are a necessity. Proper calibration is a must, along with with minimal peel up. If peel up occurs, this may be limited with application of a glue stick to the print bed or use of a heated print bed.

== Estimated Savings ==
* On the low end, a densiometer typically costs around $100. Thus, this print at its highest cost with attachments renders a savings of 97.15%.
