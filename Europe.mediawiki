=== Cycling activism ===

[http://www.ecf.com/ European Cyclists' Federation], an umbrella federation for national cycling organizations (organizations that promote bike for urban mobility) throughout Europe.

ECF was founded in 1983 by 12 bicycle user associations. It has now[when?] 74 member organizations representing over half a million individual European citizens in 39 countries. ECF actively promotes and encourages cycling worldwide while trying to enforce cycling policy at European level. One of its goals is to promote cycle tourism as a sustainable economic factor and environment-friendly mobility. It also focuses on the security of cyclists and safety for vulnerable road users. It also runs the Velo-city Conference Series, the EuroVelo cycle route project and lobbies European and international institutions. {{W|European Cyclists' Federation}}

'''EuroVelo''' bicycle routes are a network of (currently 14) long-distance cycling routes criss-crossing Europe in various stages of completion. As of May 2013 more than 45,000 km (27,962 mi) were in place.[1] It is envisaged that the network will be substantially complete by 2020 and when finished, the EuroVelo network's total length will exceed 70,000 km (43,496 mi). EuroVelo is a project of the European Cyclists' Federation (ECF).

EuroVelo routes can be used for bicycle touring across the continent, as well as by local people making short journeys. The routes are made of both existing national bike routes — such as the Dutch LF-Routes, the German D-Routes, and the British National Cycle Network — and existing general purpose roads, together with new stretches of cycle routes to connect them. {{W|EuroVelo}}

The Other Market! October 15 

:Last week I sat down with Pablo Calderon Salazar to talk about a great new project that bridges art with social design. In order to start a debat about ‘work’ in local communities initiator Calderon intervenes into daily life: he goes into dialogue with passers-by, challenging them to propose personal skills that would be usefull in a differently structured society and/or economy. Afterwards these conversations, opinions and proposals get documented with directly made posters, video’s, podcasts, drawings and photo’s.
