==Abstract==
# This Hand Pump Drill is a mechanical drill that utilizes human effort to perform the functions of a drill. In locations where power tools are too expensive or there is little access to electricity, a hand drill is an effective solution. 3D printing these means they can be very cost efficient - less than $0.25 in filament, a spring, and drill bits.

== Bill of Materials==
# Materials Needed:
## Drill Bit(s) of varying sizes - any standard drill bits should fit this drill.
## (OPTIONAL) Spring to have spring-loaded capabilities: [https://www.mcmaster.com/#9657k439/=178iw9i Purchase here]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

* This print should take about 4 hours (I printed three different prints - one with 3 pieces, one with 2, and one with 1). These could all be printed in one go, reducing print time drastically.
* Assembly should take no more than 5 to 10 minutes.
# Print all part at .1 mm resolution (lower resolution may still work, but have not been tested)
# All parts should be printed vertically. The end-handle should be printed with the hole on the narrow end facing up.
# Insert spring-slide over the drill body. After a few rotations, it should revolve smoothly.
# Place the chuck-jaws into the drill body with the jaw-cover screwing into the body over the chuck-jaws
## If a spring is being used, place the spring [https://www.mcmaster.com/#9657k439/=178iw9i Spring sized for this print] over the drill body before securing the jaw-cover
# Attach the end handle to the spring-slide

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Apply lubricant to the drill body (should not be necessary)
* Ensuring the end-handle is printed with the hole facing up ensures accurate sizing and print quality for a snap-fit.

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Costs for this hand-drill
