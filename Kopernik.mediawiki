==How it works==

Here’s how Kopernik’s online technology marketplace works:

* Their website showcases the latest [[appropriate technologies]]
* Local groups ([[NGOs]]) choose what is most needed in their area and apply online for funding.
* After vetting, Kopernik posts the project on their http://kopernik.info/ website] so that you can choose what you want to fund.
* The technology is shipped directly to the local NGO, avoiding middlemen, so more of your money (in the form of technology) reaches the end user.
* You get feedback about how your donation has helped people’s lives.
