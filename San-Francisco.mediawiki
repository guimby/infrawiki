San Francisco has had a very active environmental community. Starting with the founding of the Sierra Club in 1892 to the establishment of the non-profit Friends of the Urban Forest in 1981, San Francisco has been at the forefront of many global discussions regarding our natural environment. The 1980 San Francisco Recycling Program was one of the earliest curbside recycling programs. The city's GoSolarSF incentive promotes solar installations and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is rolling out the CleanPowerSF program to sell electricity from local renewable sources. SF Greasecycle is a program to recycle used cooking oil for conversion to biodiesel.

The newly completed Sunset Reservoir Solar Project has installed 25,000 solar panels on the 480,000 sq ft (45,000 m2) roof of the reservoir. The 5-megawatt plant more than tripled the city's 2-megawatt solar generation capacity when it opened in December 2010. <ref>[[wikipedia:San Francisco#Culture and contemporary life]]</ref>

:[[wikipedia:Cycling in San Francisco|Cycling in San Francisco]] Cycling in San Francisco has grown in popularity in recent years, aided by improving cycling infrastructure and community support. San Francisco's compact urban form and mild climate enable cyclists to reach work, shopping, and recreational destinations quickly and comfortably. Though San Francisco's famed steep hills can make cycling difficult, many parts of the city are relatively flat, including some of the most densely populated. However, heavy automobile traffic, the lack of bike lanes on many streets, and difficulty in crossing major streets deter most residents from cycling frequently in San Francisco. 75,000 residents commute by bicycle per day. <ref>[[wikipedia:San Francisco#Public transportation]]</ref>

:[[wikipedia:Bay Area Bike Share|Bay Area Bike Share]] is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. The system began operations in August 2013 and has 700 bicycles available in 70 stations, half around the city of San Francisco, and the rest along the Caltrain corridor in Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose.

:The system is operated by Alta Bicycle Share Inc. in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. The Bay Area Bike Share is the first large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States.

The SFBC organizes or promotes cycling-related events such as Bike to Work Day, Winterfest, Sunday Streets, and bike valet parking at public events.

:[[wikipedia:Cycling in San Francisco#Critical Mass|SF Critical Mass]]: The first Critical Mass bicycle ride took place on September 25, 1992 in San Francisco, and has since spread to hundreds of cities worldwide. The ride meets on the last Friday of each month at 6:00 pm at Justin Herman Plaza, and is typically attended by several thousand cyclists, who then ride through the city en masse, claiming the normally auto-dominated streets for bicycle use. The event is controversial even within the cycling community in San Francisco, some claiming that it raises beneficial public awareness of cycling issues, and others claiming that it reduces public support for cyclists' needs by enraging motorists and commuters blocked by the event.
