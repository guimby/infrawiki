==Instruction for inclusion in the Kiosk==
The purpose of this category are multifold: 
# pages in this category inform visitors of which projects are still working
# pages in this category auto-populate the CCAT kiosk
# pages in this category may auto-populate a web accessible version of the kiosk.

The automatic inclusion of pages relies on a few standards:
*Add {{Tlc|CCAT active project}} to the bottom of any active [[CCAT]] project page. 
*On any active CCAT project page, make sure that there is a section titled ''Overview''. This content of that section is automatically included into the [[CCAT kiosk]]. 
**If there is no section titled ''Overview'', it will look for one titled ''Abstract''. 
**If there is neither a section titled ''Overview'' nor ''Abstract'', the kiosk will automatically include the first paragraph from the page.
*On any active CCAT project page, make sure that there is an image that contains alt=main image in the image code. See this example code:
::<nowiki>[[file:CCATlogo.png|thumb|center|alt=main image|CCAT's logo]]</nowiki>
::Which produces:
[[file:CCATlogo.png|thumb|center|alt=main image|CCAT's logo]]

==Instructions for Operation and Maintenance instructions==

#* Please note that by following the template you cut and paste, the O&M content will auto-populate the kiosk is two different ways: 1) by autopopulating the OM link on each project; and 2) by auto-populating the OM overview on the kiosk that lists the daily, weekly, monthly, etc. tasks for all active projects.
