==Problem==
"Guinea worm disease ''(or [[Dracunculiasis]]{{w|Dracunculiasis}})'' cripples victims, leaving them unable to work, attend school, care for children, or harvest crops. Sudan is a great challenge to Guinea worm eradication, accounting for 73 percent of all reported cases. In 2000, The Sudan Guinea Worm Eradication Program (SGWEP) reported more than 54,000 new cases of Guinea worm disease (actual number of cases in Sudan is unknown) from 3,386 villages".<ref>[http://www.cartercenter.org/news/documents/doc130.html The Carter Center's "Sudan Guinea Worm Pipe Filter Project]</ref>

==Summary==
"Use of the pipe filter prevents individuals from consuming contaminated water, thus interrupting disease transmission. The original pipe filter was an adaptation to the household nylon filter cloth; nomads would hold a piece of nylon over the end of a reed, like a straw, to drink. Today, a new version of the pipe filter is being distributed in Sudan and several other endemic Guinea worm countries".
