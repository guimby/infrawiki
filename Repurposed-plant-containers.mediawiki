The standard terracotta, plastic, ceramic or concrete pots all work for planting but they can quickly add up in cost when you need a few. They're also not that creative or personal to your garden space. Test your creativity by turning lots of old unwanted items into plant containers with a difference.

== Suggestions for repurposed plant containers ==

The following list is provided as a launch point of suggestions, to inspire your own transformations:

*Watering cans
*Shoes and boots
*Old kid's plastic sandpits
*Tyres (tires)
*Teapots, coffee pots
*Clothing (legs and sleeves can be stitched together first)
*Handbags
*Shoe holding canvas hangers
*Baskets (lined or place a ceramic/glass bowl inside of it)
*Wooden boxes
*Saucepans, pots, kitchenware
*Buckets
*Plastic containers
*Fish bowls or fish tanks
*Old toys
*Old sporting gear
*Olive oil cans
*Tree stump
*Concrete blocks
*Statues or large figurines

== Things to note ==

*Provide adequate drainage holes. These are important for ensuring that the plants aren't waterlogged and also for preventing mosquito breeding should the container fill with sufficient water to create a tempting pond for them. If the container is fragile, use appropriate care to create holes; it is possible to drill holes in ceramic, terracotta, etc., if appropriate drill bits and much care is taken. Ask for advice from someone who knows how to do this if you're unsure.

*Avoid using any containers that have held toxic or poisonous items such as herbicides, insecticides, toxic paints, etc. Always know what was in the container before using it.

*Be certain that the container has sufficient space for the plant to grow, or make plans for transplanting in sufficient time.
