The chief medicinal property of horsetail is its high silica content.The best dietary source of silica is whole grains-meaning much of our dietary silica is lost in the refining process. In addition to silica, horsetail contains large amounts of potassium as well as aconitic acid, equiaitinee, starch and many fatty acids. Horsetail is often used for mending broken bones. Our hair, skin, nails, and bones all need silica.

Silica gives our cells strength, durability, and flexibility.

Think about walking outdoors on the grass. You put a lot of weight on the little blades of grass, but they spring right back up again. This is because of the high silica content in the grass. Silica enables the blades of grass to be [[resilience|resilient]] and bend, yet not be broken.
Without silica, our bones would be very brittle and break easily. The same is true of hair, skin, and nails. Without enough silica in our diet, our hair can be brittle and break easily, causing split ends.

Without enough silica, our skin loses its elasticity. Without enough silica, our nails become very brittle and split. As horsetail is very, very high in silica, it feeds our hair, skin, and nails along with our bones and keep the cells in these systems strong and resilient.

Horsetail is known to reduce chronic swelling in the legs, to relax muscle cramps, and to relieve chest problems, including damage from emphysema. Horsetail tea is often used to heal stomach ulcers. It is also effective as a gargle for gum and mouth infections and for inflammation of the throat. Because silica promotes collagen formation, it speeds up the healing of damaged connective tissue.
