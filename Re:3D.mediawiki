Re:3D is a 3D printer manufacturer. Best known for their [http://www.re3d.org/products-2/ Gigabot], which they claim is the "World's Only Affordable Large-Format 3D Printer". It follows a [[RepRap]] basic architecture, but is 600mm x 600mm x 600mm build envelope. It does not use printable parts but instead a sturdy industrial aluminum frame. It is [[open source hardware]] and Re:3D is very interested in using it for [[open source 3-D printing of OSAT]] (OSAT=[[open source appropriate technology]]).

One of the prime benefits of such a large 3D printer is that it opens up the potential to do 2 head printing - with one head for the external high-resolution printing and the other large orifice head for rapid fill. In this way you could print something like a toilet using [[recyclebot]] fabricated waste plastic as the infill and the majority of the mass of the toilet - while still maintaining finer exterior details.
