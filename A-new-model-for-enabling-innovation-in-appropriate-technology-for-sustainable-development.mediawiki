==Abstract ==
The task of providing for basic human necessities such as [[food]], [[water]], [[shelter]], and employment is growing as the worldâ€™s population continues to expand amid climate destabilization. One of the greatest challenges to development and [[innovation]] is access to relevant knowledge for quick technological dissemination. However, with the rise and application of advanced information technologies there is a great opportunity for knowledge building, community interaction, innovation, and collaboration using various online platforms. This article examines the potential of a novel model to enable innovation for collaborative enterprise, learning, and [[appropriate technology]] development on a global scale.
