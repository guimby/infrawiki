'''Copyleft''' is a play on the word [[copyright]], for the practice of using copyright law to give [[freedom]] to the users of your work, on the condition that the same rights and freedoms be preserved in modified versions of the work.

Copyleft is found in [[licenses]] such as [[CC-BY-SA]], the SA or "[[ShareAlike]]" indicating the the condition of continued sharing. This is the license used by [[Appropedia]]. Other examples include [[GFDL]] and [[computer software]] licenses.

It is also considered that a license which restricts the [[Four Freedoms]] is not copyleft.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Copyleft #Share-alike]]</ref> E.g. [[CC-BY-NC-SA]] is not copyleft in this view, as it is has a [[non-commercial clause]],

==Applying copyleft==

Common practice for using copyleft is to codify the copying terms in a license. Any such license typically gives each person possessing a copy of the work the "[[Four Freedoms]]" (from the [[Free Software Definition]]):

:0. the freedom to use the work,
:1. the freedom to study the work,
:2. the freedom to copy and share the work with others,
:3. the freedom to modify the work, and the freedom to distribute modified and therefore derivative works.
