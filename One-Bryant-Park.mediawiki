'''One Bryant Park''' is a [[green building]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City. It is the headquarters of Bank America.

It has:
* Energy-saving thermal storage system: 44 10-foot high, cylindrical tanks, each with water and a cooling coil inside. 
* Waterless urinals, which have a special drain fitted with a cartridge full of a liquid less dense than urine, which acts as a seal for odors.
* Lights that automatically dim according to daylight
* Recycled materials used extensively
* Foundation made of slag (reducing concrete use) 
* A 4.6 megawatt [[cogeneration]] plant.

It was decided not to use [[building-integrated photovoltaics]] or wind turbines as they were not cost-effective.
