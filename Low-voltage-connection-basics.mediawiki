Some really nice and useful information on this web site, also I conceive the style and design holds superb features. eagabeedkaaeaceg

== AC voltage safety  ==

AC electricity with a voltage less than 50 V (RMS) is called '''Extra Low Voltage'''. This voltage is unlikely to give a human being a dangerous electric shock.

==What is low voltage?==

*[[Electricity basics]]<!-- Add content? -->
*[[Electricity safety basics]]<!-- Add content? -->

Other names for low voltage:
*Shock free power or voltage

==What is DC voltage?== 

DC voltage is voltage that has a Plus and Minus terminal.

DC voltage symbol: [[Image:plus min power.PNG|50px]]

Other names for DC voltage:

*DC power or voltage
*Battery type of power or voltage
*Plus-minus power or voltage


==Electric DC polarity: plus and minus == <!-- Clarify the meaning of this heading. -->

[[Image:markt plus wire.PNG|thumb|Electricity basics: Marked plus wire|150px]] 

For most kinds of devices it is important to have the right voltage and polarity.
Wrong voltage or polarity can destroy a device

How to mark the plus or to find the plus pole: 

*Red is always plus.
    
*Painted line on the plus wire, no painted line on the min. 
    
*Square wire is plus, round wire is minus.   
    
*Sharp edge is plus, round wire is minus. <!-- Did you mean smooth edge? -->   
    
*Knot is plus, no knot is minus.   
    
*Mark on the plus wire, the plus wire is special.     
  
*and so on, the plus wire is special or not normal than a normal wire. <!-- Repeat intentional? -->     



These must be in good working order to save your electric material:

*The voltage.

*The amperage.

*The plus and minus position.

*The type of power, AC or DC. 

*The type of low voltage coax connector.

*Protect your plug and connector against mechanical pulling force.

*Take your time to check these 6 items.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> - Depending on how your output device is made, this condition may cause the output device (usually some kind of wall plug adapter) to burn out. The better made ones will have some sort of over-current protection built in, either in the form of a thermal fuse (self resetting), or a current limiter.

==What is an electrical short?==

An electrical short is when the plus and minus are in contact with each other.

This is harmful for the adapter or battery. 

==Electrical short with (dis)connecting device==<!-- Writing (dis)connect indicates either connect or disconnect. Is that what you intended? If you mean just disconnect, delete the (). -->

Some smaller connectors shortcut the power supply if you (dis)connect .

(dis)Connect the connector to the device if there is NO power on the plug.

==Car cigarette lighter plug==

A car cigarette lighter plug must have the plus in the middle and the minus on the outside.

Some female car sockets have 24 volts.
