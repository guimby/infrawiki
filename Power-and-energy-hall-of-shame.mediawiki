==Hall of Shame==
Many people violate the definitions of power and energy.  Some people do it publicly, thereby misleading unfortunate readers.  Below is a short list of some of these violators.  If you know another site, book, journal, etc. please add it to this list.  If you want someone to check out a dubious definition or comment about power and energy, or if your site is on this list and you rebuke the claim of violation, please add your comment to the [[Talk:Power and energy hall of shame|discussion]] tab.  If your site is on this list and you have fixed it, congratulations and thank you, please feel free to move your site to the [[#Removed from the Hall of Shame for Honorable Behaviour|removed site list]] or just ask on the [[Talk:Power and energy hall of shame|discussion]] tab.  Remember, in short, '''Energy''' equals '''Power''' multiplied by '''Time''', where:
*'''Energy''' is a measurable quantity, an ability to do work.  In electricity it is measured with the unit '''kilowatt-hour (kWh)'''.
*'''Power''' is the rate at which work is performed.  In electricity it is measured with the unit '''watt (W)'''.
See [[Electricity basics]] and [[Power and energy]] for more information.

===And the Winner Is...===
The top entry in the hall of shame goes to [http://people.howstuffworks.com/ Howstuffworks.com].  Their error is on the first page of how hydropower plants work. [[User:Lonny|I]] have emailed them about this, as well as other errors, to no avail.  Now they have become the winner of the Hall of Shame - Power vs. Energy.

Currently no Hall of Shame sites have fixed their erroneous content.  Please feel free to email the sites about their deeds.

==Explanation of the Howstuffwork.com Error==
HowStuffWorks says the world's hydropower output is approximately 675,000 MW.  This is consistent with data published by [http://www.worldenergy.org/wec-geis/publications/reports/ser/hydro/excel_files/hydro_7_2.xls worldenergy.org], and is roughly equivalent to 340 dams of 2,000 MW each.  [http://www.enerwiki.com/index.php/Hoover_Dam Hoover Dams].  (Note HowStuffWorks referred to the term "output" which is sometimes used interchangeably in industry as "capacity".)   Total hydro generation according to world energy is about 2,633 TWh in 1999, resulting in a respectable average capacity factor of 43% (2,633 TWh / (675,000 MW * 8760 hrs/yr) ).  

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_of_oil_equivalent Assuming one MWh is the energy equivalent of 1.7 barrels of oil], then hydro generation is equivalent to roughly 1.5 billion barrels of oil.  Looks like  where they went wrong with the calculation is they assumed hydro plants run 100% of the time.  If hydro plants did run all the time, that would be 3.5 billion barrels of oil however. ~[http://www.enerwiki.com lori g]. Hydro plants can only run when there is water behnd them. If the generation capacity of the dam was equal to the average flow of the river then it could run at 100% capacity all the time. In practice the generation capacity of most dams is higher so they can generate more electricty when demand is higher (during the day) and balance this by running at part load when demand is low (e.g. at night).
