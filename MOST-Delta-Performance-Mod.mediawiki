==Abstract==
* In order to print materials other than PLA, a controlled environment is needed to prevent rapid cooling which leads to plastic warping. After searching for enclosure modifications, I decided to create my own, low-cost modification to fix a relatively simple problem. My design has been created as an affordable, "good enough" solution.
* Using this enclosure, ABS and nylon are now within reach of any MOST Delta builder with a simple modification that can be completed in the average dorm room.

== Bill of Materials==
# (3) 12x18in thick cardboard
# Aluminum Foil to Cover

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
* Total assembly time is roughly one hour..
* If you have any large gaps, they will need to be filled or covered with foil. This is to prevent excess heat loss.

== Notes ==
After testing various combinations of plywood and available sheetrock, and their insulating values, I settled on aluminum foil wrapped cardboard as the most accessible and affordable. However, this does not diminish the quality of insulating ability provided.

=== Assembly Instructions ===
# Cut the cardboard to ensure a tight fit, and wrap in aluminum foil.
# Apply magnets to cardboard panels and delta wood.

=== Results ===
The enclosure was tested by heating the interior air with a blow-dryer up to ~130F. The temperature was then measured at 60 second intervals to test the insulating value of the enclosure, and the results can be seen in the gallery above.
