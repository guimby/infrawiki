"[http://www.greenpower.gov.au/ GreenPower] is a joint initiative of ACT, NSW, SA, QLD, VIC and WA government agencies to guarantee that the renewable electricity you buy from energy suppliers meets stringent environmental standards." Note that different types of "green power" may have quite different mixes of energy, and some are criticized as not being really "green."
