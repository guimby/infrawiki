Swales and rain gardens are very similar in concept, process and appearance to bioretention cells, but with more emphasis on natural processes and less on engineering.{{fact}} They may be expected to have lower capacities for handling large flows, but when integrated into a landscape on a large scale, their total flow handling may be similar. Their advantages are in:
* Greater [[groundwater recharge]]{{fact}} 
* Reduced flow downstream and off-site, where adequate capacity is provided. This means less need for downstream stormwater treatment, and less contribution to downstream flooding.
