'''MayaPedal''' is a non-governmental organization in San Andrés Itzapa, Chimaltenango, [[Guatemala]]. It started in 1997, with the involvement of a group of [[Canada|Canadians]] from the organization [[PEDAL]]. In 2001 it was constituted under local control as '''Asociación Maya Pedal'''. Used [[bicycle]]s are converted to pedal-powered machines, "bicimáquinas," which aid the work of small-scale, self-sustainable projects. 

Bicimáquinas (translates as "bicycle machines") are pedal-powered machines that act as an [[intermediate technology]] to assist in obtaining a higher production capacity in agriculture and in small business.
