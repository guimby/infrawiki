== Introduction ==
Quality control (QC) is not an optional extra in food processing; neither is it something done only by large manufacturers.  It is an essential component of any food processing business.  The purposes of quality control are:
[[Image:quality_control_suits.jpg|thumb|150px|right|]]

•	To protect the customers from dangers (eg contaminated foods) and ensure that they get the weight and quality of food that they pay for.

•	To protect the business from cheating by suppliers, damage to equipment (eg stones in raw materials) and false accusations by middlemen, customers or suppliers.

•	To be sure that food laws operating in a country are complied with.

Quality control need not be time consuming or expensive, and the results of quality control tests should help save money in the long run.  In general, quality control procedures should be as simple as possible and only give the required amount of information. Too little information means the test has not done its job; too much information and management decisions may be delayed or confused.

Quality control is used to predict and control the quality of processed foods.  It is no use producing a food, testing it to find the  quality, and  then  trying to find a buyer  for that particular batch of food. Quality control  is used  to predict the  quality  of the  processed food and  then  control  the  process so that  the  expected quality  is achieved for every batch. This means that quality specifications must be written and agreed with suppliers or sellers, and control points must be identified in the process.

== Quality specifications ==
[[Image:quality_control_specs.jpg|thumb|150px|right|]]
The quality of foods or ingredients can be measured in different ways but one popular method is to describe 'quality attributes', as in Table 1.  A specification can then be written and agreed with the supplier or seller, which lists the quality attributes that are required in a food.  An example of a quality specification for tomatoes to be used for processing into paste is shown in Table 1.

'''Table  1''': Quality attributes for tomatoes used  for tomato paste.

A number of points arise  from such  a specification:

 
•	A representative sample of the  food must  be tested to make  sure  the  whole batch meets the  specification. (For small  batches it might  be possible to examine every item.) The size of sample needed for testing can  be calculated, but  this  is fairly complex, and  usually  unnecessary for a small- scale business.

[[Image:quality_control_fruitharness.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Figure 1: Fruit hardness test using a penetrometer.]]

•	The percentage of substandard items which  cause a batch to fail the  test  can be increased or decreased depending
on how reliable the  supplier is, or how important the  particular attribute is to the  seller/manufacturer.

•	Some  attributes may need to be tested with equipment in order  to avoid arguments over interpretation.  In Figure  1, for example, the  hardness could  be tested with a simple
'penetrometer' to define what  is 'hard' and  what  is 'soft'.

 
The size and  shape of the  tomatoes is not important because they  are to be crushed to a pulp. In other  examples (such as fruit  for bottling) the  size might  be important.  The ripeness and flavour of the  tomatoes - assessed by colour  and  hardness -, and  damage caused by poor storage and  handling, are very important: the  specification concentrates on these. Each  specification takes account of the  intended use  of the  products and  the  most  likely important faults that  could  be expected.

== Control points ==
In every food process there are particular stages which affect the quality of the final product. For example, the amount of heating given to pasteurise juices affects their colour, flavour and storage life; in sausage making, the amount and type of grinding affects the texture of the meat.   Such stages are identified as control points, and quality control checks are made at these points in order to control the process.
[[Image:quality_control_ruler.jpg|thumb|150px|right|]]

Manufacturers therefore need first to identify the control points in their process - using outside technical assistance if necessary - and then to set up a specification for operators to use. For example, in jam making, the  amount of pectin, fruit  and  sugar  should be carefully controlled: therefore, the  weighing  of ingredients is a control  point, as the  weights  of each ingredient must  be specified and  carefully weighed  out. 

In the  same way, other  control  points would be:  the  acidity  of the  jam, the  sugar  content after boiling  and  the  temperature of filling.  The mix should be checked for correct acidity, the sugar content checked during boiling (using a thermometer or refract meter), and the temperature checked before filling (using a thermometer).

Checks at control points can therefore be used to control the process and to ensure that each batch of product is of similar quality.
