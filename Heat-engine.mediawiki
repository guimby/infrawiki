A '''heat engine''', such as the [[Stirling engine]], typically uses [[energy]] provided in the form of [[heat]] to do work and then exhausts the heat which cannot be used to do work. They operate in a cyclic manner and are usually illustrated by a [[Pressure volume diagram|PV diagram]]. 

[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/heatengcon.html#c1 This site] provides a concept map that explains heat engines. 

A [[heat pump]] can be considered to be a "heat engine in reverse", in which energy is ''applied'' to transfer heat into or out of an area as desired.
