The [[potato]] was introduced to the world from its native Peru several hundred years ago and quickly spread to all corners of the globe. These days its importance as a staple food crop cannot be overstated. There are several other tubers from the Andes region of South America that have a promising future, including the mashua, yac칩n, ulluco, and oca.
