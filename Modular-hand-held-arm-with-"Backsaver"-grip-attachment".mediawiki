==Abstract==

With a modular setup, this device can be used as multiple tools in one. Main applications could be for people from third world countries where there is minimal automation. A shovel helper grip attachment could save a lot of effort by transferring some of the load from the user's back to the well gripped other hand. This in-turn results into lesser fatigue and more productivity. 

Also, the Leaf Claws attachment can function as a big sized leaf collector hand or as even a shovel for damp yards. These type of attachments could also be used to reach certain areas (eg: for maintenance purposes in sanitation) where use of bare hands could have caused infections.

== Bill of Materials==
# 3 bolts: 5/16 inch diameter with approx 5 cm length: 38 cents x 3 = USD 1.14
# 3 Nuts that fit into those bolts:  21 cents x 3 = USD 0.63 
# Hair band / Rubber band: Free?
# PLA filament: Approx 50 x 3 grams = USD 3.2

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Knowledge of FreeCAD and Cura

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
-
To Assemble:
-
# Download the part files provided above in the bill of materials
# Convert stl files to gcode using software like Cura
# Print all of the Parts
# Attach a hair band / rubber band with the handle arm to make it a comfortable grip on the user's wrist
# Connect the interlocking jaws of whichever tool you want to use 
# Secure with nut and bolt
-
Time:
* Total print time estimate: 5 hours
* Total assembly time estimate: 3 minutes

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* One must be careful of your printer radius and calibration as a couple of those parts only just fit into my Delta: check how thw first couple of layers print and shrink the models if needed (all be same amount)
* Sticking to the bed could be a common problem in case of such large prints: Use high quantities of washable glue on bed before printing

== Cost savings==
# Cost Estimate: USD 5 for two tools
# Equivalent products in market cost: USD 33 (Backsaver grip: USD 13 and Leaf claw: USD 20)
#Net savings achieved: USD 28
