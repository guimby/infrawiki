Handcarts are an efficient way to use human power to move cargo over moderate terrain with a relatively wide (4 ft+) side to side level surface. Handcarts have two wheels with a box or bed in between, and extended handles. Handcarts have been the "pickup trucks" of China. Garden cart versions are widely available in the USA. Agri-Fab makes a nice 14 cu. ft. model which has better wheels than many others.  Handcarts are easier to pull than push. A harness that pulls from the hip is more efficient than pulling with hands/arms. I like a harness like at: http://www.armysurpluswarehouse.com/product/sled-harness-3124.cfm  If bicycle type wheels are used, bicycle brakes operated by hand levers and cables or rods can be used to more easily and safely move the cart down steeper terrain.  Many nice handcart designs have been developed in Africa. One is at: http://mercurypoisoningproject.org/malawi/background.html
