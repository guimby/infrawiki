This page details the process of making a receptacle out of sustainable materials for use on a college campus. Materials and processes include – making glue with rice flour, construction using cardboard, paper mâché, and natural paints. This is one of 2 drop boxes built for the R.O.S.E. Center; to see the other visit [[R.O.S.E._Drop_Box|R.O.S.E. Drop Box]].

==Background==
The Reusable Office Supply Exchange Center, or  [http://humboldt.edu/wrrap/rose.html R.O.S.E.], is a program on the Humboldt State University Campus. The program seeks to increase reuse by collecting office supplies, such as binders, notebooks, pens and pencils, paper, etc. and offers the supplies to students and faculty, who come by the R.O.S.E. office, free of charge. Students and faculty on campus donate the office supplies, and need a convenient location to drop off these supplies.  The placement of a drop box in the library or Student Business Services Building would provide ease of use for students and faculty, and increase publicity and awareness of the R.O.S.E. program. Because of the center’s commitment to recycling and reuse, the receptacle it self must use these guidelines.
