==Problem being addressed==
Contaminated water sources are often the cause for diarrheal diseases. Inhabitants in low-resource settings often lack ready access to clean water and are most susceptible to diseases caused by contaminated water.  In addition, water supplies can be contaminated with high levels of arsenic.  For example, in eastern Nepal, 9% of the 268 water samples contained arsenic above the WHO guidelines.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Arsenic Bio-sand Filter (ABF) removes arsenic, iron, and bacterial contamination without using any chemicals.  The arsenic unit removes arsenic by oxidation/reduction, precipitation, and adsorption.  The pathogen removal unit contains sand and gravel layers that remove deadly pathogens.  The ABF unit can process 15 to 30 liters of water per hour.

==Designed by==
*Design: This filter was developed by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) of Nepal, and Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Support Programme (RWSSSP) of Nepal.

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
Studies conducted in Nepal so far have shown that the Kanchan Arsenic Filter is effective in removing arsenic, iron as well as bacteria together.  The users liked the high flow rate, simple operation, minimal maintenance, as well as the clean-looking and good-tasting water coming out of the filters. They think the filter is a durable, permanent solution to their drinking water problems.

==Funding Source==
This project received a $115,000 award from the World Bank Development Marketplace Global Competition.
