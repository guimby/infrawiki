== Welcome ==
Welcome to ENGR 215 Introduction to Design. This is a 3-credit course aimed at introducing the student to the engineering design process, including critical analysis of problems, teamwork, design thinking and technical communication. The course meets weekly for 2 hours of lecture and 3 hours of lab. However, these "lecture" periods and "lab" periods will be used for multiple learning formats as this course will integrate lecture, discussion, student projects, computer labs and outdoor field activities. It will require active learning on your part. 

== Course Objectives ==
* Students will learn about and experience the engineering design process with a sustainability focus.
* Students will further develop the many computing skills needed by practicing engineers and scientists. These skills include:
** word processing
** spreadsheet
** CAD (Computer Aided Design)
** Internet skills, including email, web searches and web/wiki pages

* Students will further develop the many communication skills needed by practicing engineers and scientists. These skills include:
** written communication
** verbal and visual presentation skills
** teamwork (including feedback)

===ERE Outcomes===
This course addresses the following Environmental Resources Engineering student outcomes:
*'''a''') an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering
*'''c''') an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability
*'''d''') an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams
*'''f''') an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
*'''g''') an ability to communicate effectively
*'''k''') an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

===Humboldt State University Student Learning Outcomes===
HSU graduates will have demonstrated:

*Effective communication through written and oral modes.
*Critical and creative thinking skills in acquiring a broad base of knowledge and applying it to complex issues
*Competence in a major area of study.
*Appreciation for and understanding of an expanded world perspective by engaging respectfully with a diverse range of individuals, communities and viewpoints.

HSU graduates will be prepared to:

*Succeed in their chosen careers.
*Take responsibility for identifying personal goals and practicing lifelong learning.
*Pursue social justice, promote environmental responsibility, and improve economic conditions in their workplaces and communities.

== Grading ==
You are expected to attend and participate in all class sessions. You are expected to complete the assigned reading prior to the date indicated on the class schedule, to do all homework assignments, and to participate fully in the team projects. Your fellow students '''will''' evaluate your performance on the team projects. Attendance at all group/teamwork sessions is mandatory. ''If you have more than 3 unexcused absences, you will receive an F in the course.''

* 50% Design Project Report (Design Team)
* 15% Peer Evaluation (Design Team)
*  8% Rube Goldberg Design Project (Design Group)
* 22% Lab and Class assignments (Individual and Group Work)
*  5% Class Portfolio (Individual Work)

===Online assignments===
Some assignments will be posted online and publicly accessible. Please feel free to use an alias for any reason (e.g. privacy, future employment ramifications, etc.). The assignments we post online are so that you can learn wiki-formatting and so that future students and community members can learn from and build upon our work. The final online assignment is a portfolio of your work, if you are seeking increased anonymity, I strongly encourage you to post your portfolio on your HSU user account instead of Appropedia.

===Late Assignments===
Assignments that are submitted after the due date without prior instructor approval will be severely penalized or not accepted.

Make-up assignments will only be accepted in extraordinary situations that are verifiable and well documented. The reason for missing work must be substantial and quite beyond the student’s control.

===Final Exam===
The final exam schedule is [http://pine.humboldt.edu/registrar/pdf/CurrentFinalExam.pdf here]. Please also see the schedule of assignments and calendar on Moodle.

== Academic Honesty ==
Throughout this course, the sharing of ideas will often be educationally useful. Part of my teaching philosophy is to encourage students to learn from one another and to help fellow students to learn. The team projects illustrate the collaborative approach.

Collaboration on coursework is authorized in this course provided that it is done in the spirit of mutual learning and sharing of ideas. When this occurs, you should indicate the names of all persons with whom you collaborated. '''The copying of someone else’s work or ideas and representing them as your own is unethical and prohibited.''' As in most, if not all issues involving ethical considerations, it may be hard to know where to draw the line. If you do not provide the names of your co-workers, I will presume the collaboration is copying, not mutual learning. If you do collaborate, it must be noted and you are still responsible for understanding all the material.

You should read:
The official [http://www2.humboldt.edu/studentrights/home Student Code of Conduct] and [https://www2.humboldt.edu/studentrights/academic-honesty HSU’s Policy of Academic Honesty].
<center>'''I expect all students to abide by the HSU Code of Conduct.'''</center>

== Professional Ethics ==
Below are some URLs that provide useful information of the ASCE code of ethics for Professional Engineers and ethics for engineering and science.

*[http://www.asce.org/code-of-ethics/ ASCE Code of Ethics] 
*[http://www.nspe.org/ethics/ National Society for Professional Engineers Ethics Homepage]

== Course Materials ==
*Presentation materials for final project poster and for final project document
*A maximum of $100.00 in project materials ($25 – Rube Goldberg, $75 – Design Project). ''This course material cost is in lieu of an engineering book, which would probably (a) be more expensive, and (b) not teach you as much as hands on learning in this design course.'' 

== Attendance ==
Attendance at all class/lab sessions is mandatory. If you will miss a session, you must contact your instructor in advance to arrange a make up or alternate exercise. Failure to do so will result in a grade penalty. If you have more than 3 unexcused absences, you will receive an F in the course.

Makes-ups will only be given in extraordinary situations that are verifiable and well documented. The reason for missing work must be substantial and quite beyond the student’s control. Not many excuses are accepted. The instructor will decide whether an excuse is acceptable. One criterion for acceptance of any excuse will be its timeliness. ''Therefore, whenever possible, inform me before the missed work is due''.

Students are responsible for knowing policy regarding attendance and disruptive behavior: https://www2.humboldt.edu/studentrights/attendance-behavior

== Building Access ==
We are incredibly lucky to have a building and resources open to students at all hours, but you MUST get a keycard to enter the building after hours.  To do so, register [https://gallatin.humboldt.edu/~ere/keycard.php here]. As a very fair consideration, you should NEVER prop open the door to the building.  If you abuse your privileges, you risk losing after hours building access.

== Students with Disabilities ==
If you have any type of disability that may hamper your full participation in course activities, it is your responsibility to inform me of your need for accommodations as soon as possible.  I expect to hear from you within the first two weeks of the semester so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged. Complete information on the services available at HSU can be found at the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC) in House 71, 826-4678 (voice) or 826-5392 (TDD) or on their website http://www.humboldt.edu/disability/. Some accommodations may take up to several weeks to arrange.

== HSU Writing Studio, Library 1st Floor ==
In addition to meeting with me during office hours, I encourage you to visit the Writing Studio as you work on writing assignments in this course. The Writing Studio offers free peer assistance with all kinds of writing projects in person and over email. Whatever your major or skill level, you can benefit from working one-on-one with a consultant. To schedule an in-person or email consultation, visit http://www.humboldt.edu/learning/writing-studio or call 707-826-5217. The Studio is located on the 1st floor of the Library.
