=Intro=
Testing biodigester effluent is also important in order to know how effective it is as a fertilizer.  Many farmers rely on manure from their animals and biodigesters take this animal manure to produce gas.  Making sure the resulting biodigester effluent can also be used as a fertilizer with equal or better results to that of traditional or commonly used fertilizers is extremely important to insuring that the biodigester can become an integrated addition to the farm. 

=Background=

Testing is being done by the Laboratorio de Ajusco de Tecnologia Alternativa, a nonprofit laboratory providing technical assistance in testing different [[appropriate technologies]]. Right now they are working with Isla Urbana for rainwater quality testing and the International Renewable Resources Institute-Mexico for biodigester effluence water and fertilizer quality studies.


The [[International Renewable Resources Institute-Mexico| International Renewable Resources Institute]] and [[Biobolsa]] wanted to test their biodidgester systems for fertilizer quality and applicability.  This is part of a testing series for biodigester effluence the accompanying testing is on [[Biodigester Effluent Water Quality Testing with IRRI|water quality of biodigesters]].
