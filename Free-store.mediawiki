A free store, or a Give-away shop, is like a regular store, except items are given away for free.  Free stores keep unwanted items out of landfills while getting items to people who need them and reducing consumerism by preventing purchase of those items.  Some free stores exist year-round, while others are organized for a short time and are then dismantled.   Free stores may be organized around occasions when discarded goods are particularly plentiful, such as [[dumpster diving#Dormster diving|the end of the school year at universities]].  To set up a free store, the main needs are a space, volunteers to organize the space, stuff to give away, and people to take it.
