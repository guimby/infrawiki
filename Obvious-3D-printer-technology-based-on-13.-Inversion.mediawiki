#Motors on Extruder rather than base
#Use pellets or liquid instead of filament 
#Motors on moving parts instead of base(on the pieces that connect to rods)
#bed moves instead of extruder
#ball bearings on extruder and magnets on poles
#Non-fixed bed instead of fixed for better leveling 
#Only use recycled materials instead of filament 
#Use Quick Cooling filament that is extremely sturdy
#Print upside down
#Instead of printing, mill it
#Make base move instead of bed (X and Y)
#Use a combination of printing and milling for better precision
#Reuse milled filament
#Combine and Delta and XYZ
#Use a moving print surface for multiple colors (one on each side of base)
#Base is top and bottom is print surface encased in foam for sound isolation
#Power for head through connection rods.
#power for resistor through connection rods
#power for fan through connection rods
#recycle power from extruder for other uses in printer
#Use power from environment to heat extruder (sun, ect)
#Use tears of students as lubricant for print rods to make it quieter.
#Use camera to get feedback on print into system
#Use ir sensor to get feedback into system
#allow print surface to tilt for additional leveling features
