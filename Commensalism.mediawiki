'''Commensalism''' refers to the relationship between two organisms of different species with respect to the consumption of food. The term means "eating at the same table".<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism</ref>

Usually, one of the two organisms takes advantage of the feeding habits of the other organism. In many cases, the organism taking advantage does not give anything in return for gaining the benefits, nor does it generally harm the other organism by its feeding actions. 

An example is that of rodents feeding off human food stocks.
