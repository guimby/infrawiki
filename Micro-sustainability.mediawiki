'''Micro-sustainability''' is the collected small environmental actions which together may have a large environmental impact. It involves individual efforts, behavior modification and changes in attitude

[[Actions]] include [[recycling]], [[energy-efficiency]] at a household level and turning off appliances and [[electric lights]] when not in use, setting [[thermostats]] appropriately, [[conserving water]], and changing [[transport]] habits modes.
 
Large-scale plans for sustainability can then be considered [[macro-sustainability]] - these are addressed by [[governments]] and large [[businesses]]. They combat global issues through large-scale actions, infrastructure projects and policies. Essential to this is the business case, [[return on investment]] (e.g. through savings in energy costs) and (in the case of government policy) the impact on the society and economy. Tools include regulation, subsidies, research and development and investment.
