*Show your work on the following questions from class:
*#If you have a wind turbine with three blades, each 4 meters long, what distance does the tip of each blade travel in one full revolution?  
*#If this turbine is rotating at a rate of 42 Revolutions per Minute (RPM), how long does it take to make one full revolution? 
*#Based on your answers from 1 and 2, calculate how fast the tips of this wind turbine are moving through the air.  
*#If the wind is blowing at 6 meters per second, what is the tip speed ratio of this turbine? Use your answers from questions 1-3 to help solve this problem.  
*#According to the “optimal” tip speed ratio for this three-bladed turbine, are these blades moving too fast or too slow?  
*#An offshore wind turbine with three 60 meter blades rotates at a leisurely 12 RPM. The wind is whipping along at 18 meters per second. What is the tip speed ratio for this turbine? How does this compare to the “optimal” tip speed ratio for this turbine?
