'''Green bans''' are strike action, usually by a workers' group, carried out for [[environmentalist]], conservationist or heritage purposes.

They began in [[Sydney]] in 1971, when 13 middle-class women teamed up with trade unionists led by Jack Mundey.

"This was the first time the enlightened working class teamed with the enlightened middle class anywhere in the world" - Jack Mundey.<ref name="SYDNEYMAG">"The Kelly Gang," ''The Sydney Magazine'' (Sydney Morning Herald), #96, April 2011.</ref>

<blockquote>
"What's the use of getting better wages and better conditions if we choke to death in unplanned, polluted cities?" - Jack Mundey.<ref name="SYDNEYMAG"/>
