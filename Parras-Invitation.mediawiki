Parras de la Fuente, although surrounded by the desert, rests on underground streams that engender a perfect Mediterranean climate. Parras offers spectacular natural settings and many outdoor activities such as exploring caverns, mountains, rivers, and swimming in large pools formed from underground springs.  Parras is the home of 400-year old adobe houses, a baroque church, revolutionary Francisco I. Madero’s childhood home, textile manufacturers, aqueducts, pecan orchards, cactus farms and the first winery in the Americas, founded in 1597. 

Parras is a very pleasant town of 44,000 people located between Torreón and Saltillo in the northeastern border state of Coahuila.  It is not far away from other beautiful towns such as Durango, Zacatecas, Saltillo, Real de Catorce, the cultural and industrial magnet-city of Monterrey and the spectacular Copper Canyon and Zona del Silencio.

The striking natural beauty of the region combined with the friendly and resourceful community is perfect for an academic program emphasizing appropriate and [[sustainable technology]].

Universidad Tecnológica de Coahuila, established in 1995, is part of a nationwide system of campuses serving thousands of Mexican students throughout 32 states. The Universidad Tecnológica de Coahuila (UTC), campus Parras, specifically offers courses of technology and its environmental impact. The UTC has partnered with Humboldt State University to host the Parras Summer Program by providing the facilities, classrooms, library, computers, interrelation with Mexican students, and work experiences for students.
