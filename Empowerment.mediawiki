'''Empowerment''' is to give a group or individual the [[power]] to go down/choose a certain course of action. It may involve giving [[knowledge]] or resources to some group, individual or entity, [[freedom]] (and awareness and assurance of their freedom, that it will not be taken away) and almost by definition involves their [[participation]].
