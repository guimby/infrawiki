This table provides a '''comparison of ecologic seagoing boats'''. It includes sailboats and motorboats running on combustible zero-emission fuels. Only combustible zero emission fuels have been implemented to allow the implementation of data from regular internal combustion motorboats (which can be converted). Specific focus has been put on the decrease in purchasing and operation cost as the size of the vessel increases.
