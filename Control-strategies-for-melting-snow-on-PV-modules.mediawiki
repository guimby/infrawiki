This page is the basic outline for control strategies for removing snow from [[PV]] modules in northern climates using a heating mechanism to melt the snow. Why is this a problem? See [[Effects of snow on photovoltaic performance]] and [[Impact of Snow and Ground Interference on Photovoltaic Electric System Performance]]

==Potential Inputs==
Sensor inputs for determining snow cover
* temperature
* snow depth via sensor
* optical occlusion
* optical reflection from modules
* force sensor
* module image
* off-site weather data/ past and/or predicted
* reduced PV output as compared to heated (always on) pyranometer
* IR sensing
* wireless/wired connection to web server that has current weather information (also a dispatch strategy)
* certain decrease in panel output power

==Potential Outputs==
Electrical resistive heating using one of the following methods:
* heat strips on back of panel
* heat strips on edges of panel
* electrically conductive optically transparent front retrofit of panel
* electrically conductive optically transparent front integrated panel (e.g. top layer of glass, in eva, etc.)
* external heater
* liquid heating on edges of panel
* liquid heating underneath panel
* mechanical clearing
* compressed air, air blast clearing
* chemical release -- e.g. salt solution

==Potential Dispatch Strategies==
* always on
* manual on/off
* on every morning, or other set amount of days
* melt while snowing
* melt every snow fall
* melt on predetermined time -- dynamic so changes during snow season based on historical data or current weather trends
* melt on predetermined depth or weight of snow or optical occlusion
* change as a function of time, temperature, output, solar flux
* wireless/wired connection to web server that has current weather information (also an input strategy)
* dependent upon amount of panel output power
