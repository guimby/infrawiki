= Overview =
The purpose of this project is to determine mechanical properties of polymer components printed with the open source [http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page RepRap Mendel 3-D printer]. Standard test methods are to be used to gather accurate and acceptable test data. The results of the mechanical testing will be used for engineering analysis of parts designed to be created with the RepRap.

The results are published here: B.M. Tymrak, M. Kreiger, [[J. M. Pearce]], [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2014.02.038 Mechanical properties of components fabricated with open-source 3-D printers under realistic environmental conditions], ''Materials & Design'', 58, pp. 242-246 (2014).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2014.02.038.
