Designed specifically for use by children ages 3 to 13, the ICDL is a housed by the International Children's Digital Library Foundation. It provides free access to high-quality digital books from around the world. Browse by age, genre, book length, character types, or even the color of a book's cover.

The ICDL is a rich resource which can be used in a wide range of situations by children, parents, teachers, librarians and others from all walks of life.  Children can expand upon the stories to create games; parents can extract themes to help explain important lessons; teachers can utilize the multicultural nature of the collection to teach languages; librarians can enrich community outreach programs with tales from around the world and; of course, anyone can just open a book to read for pleasure.

==Suggested Projects ==
* Turn Appropedia [[projects]] into engaging children's books and openly publish at ICDL to spread the wealth of knowledge on [[appropriate technology]] to those all over the world. (note: does not currently accept born digital books --so you will need to get your book published - and then have it accepted by ICDL).
