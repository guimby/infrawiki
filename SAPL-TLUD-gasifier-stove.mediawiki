The TLUD stove is a simple wood [[Stove]] that is green and of low carbon emission. It is a project of [[SAPL|SERVALS Automation Pvt LTD]]<ref>Page adapted from [http://servalsgroup.blogspot.com/2009/05/tlud-gasifier-stoves-wood-stove-with.html Servals Automation Pvt Ltd: TLUD Gasifier Stoves - A wood stove with a difference]</ref>&nbsp; This project is the winner of the [http://servalsgroup.blogspot.com/2010/05/sapl-wins-sankalp-2010-award-in-clean.html Sankalp 2010 award ]in the Clean Energy Sector – Established Enterprise Category. 

== Highlights  ==

#The key focus is to design an integrated cooking energy solution for the wood stove market that addresses the “front-end” and the “back-end”. 
#TLUD stands for ''Top Lit Up Draft''. This is different from most of the ordinary cook stoves which are Bottom Lit Up Draft. There is a lot of interest in TLUD technology around the world since this saves around 75&nbsp;% fuel material compared to a traditional 3 stone fire wood stove. 
#While the TLUD gasifier technology is not new, SAPL’s TLUD Stove’s claim is that it represents a higher order of fuel efficiency, user friendliness, safety and newer user application. 
#Recognized as a “carbon neutral” initiative; In fact would be "[http://servalsgroup.blogspot.com/2009/08/reducing-carbon-footprint-while-cooking.html carbon negative]" when the charcoal is dumped back into the soil.

#Has the potential to create a series of economic activities around fuel collection and distribution. [http://servalsgroup.blogspot.com/2008/04/creating-rural-entrepreneurs.html Read More...] 
#Has a line-up of innovations in the pipeline.&nbsp;[http://servalsgroup.blogspot.com/2010/05/with-commercial-launch-of-stainless.html Read More] 
#We have also applied for International Product Validation and Verification from Aprevocho Research Center , USA and Bio-char research project,Australia

== Key Product Advantages  ==

#The major advantage lies in its energy efficiency. It has been tested to have an efficiency of 39% Vs the 9% of the 3 stone stove. 
#A second advantage with TLUD technology is that it can accept a lot of waste materials as fuel like twigs, coconut shells, certain husks, dry grass, etc. Some of these fuels are also available at NIL cost in specific instances. 
#A third advantage is that tree felling is not necessary for fuel, since residues as mentioned above is enough. 
#A fourth advantage is that the entire process is carbon-neutral if the resultant charcoal is also burned. In case this charcoal is taken out and used as a soil conditioner, the entire process becomes carbon-negative. ie. practically, carbon is removed from the atmosphere and deposited in the soil. Hence TLUD technology is extremely environment-friendly.

== The Process  ==

[[Image:TLUD Stove 3.jpg|thumb]] The canister is filled with the fuel material. A small quantity of starter material is put on top of this fuel bed and set on fire. Primary air for combustion comes from below through the fuel bed. The heat from the fire pyrolysis the biomass immediately below to form pyrolysis gases. These gases move up and get combusted with the pre-heated secondary air that is fed from around. Once the pyrolysis is over, a small quantity of charcoal is left behind at the bottom of the canister. This charcoal is generally transferred to a metallic or earthen closed container where the fire gets put out in the absence of air. This charcoal can be used later for various purposes. 

The present design used by Servals has been given by Dr. Paul S Anderson of US. SAPL is already offering the stainless steel version commercially. The institutional version and the ceramic version are due to be launched by the end of the year.

As it looks at present, TLUD Gasifier Stove technology holds tremendous potential in relation to greener environment and low carbon initiatives.
