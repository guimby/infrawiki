== Recycling of plastic ==
*A large quantity of used plastic is collected at certain areas.<br /> 
*Once the plastic is collected,it is sorted and separated according to the type of polymer it is made of. <br /> Plastic products are given certain [[codes]] to help the sorting and separating process.<br />
*Then the plastic is reprocessed. The reprocessing of polymers includes the [[melting process]], the melting process is possible if the polymers have not been widely cross-linked with any synthetics. Otherwise, it is difficult to stretch and less pliable.<br />
*The final step is the manufacturing of the melted plastic into new [[products]].
