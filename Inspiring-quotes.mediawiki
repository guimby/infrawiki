"To Save the Children, [[sustainable development]] means that each generation should leave to its children a world at least as diverse and productive as the one it inherited. It also means guaranteeing the rights of all today's children, so that they can fulfil their potential in the struggle for development. The millions of children still denied their basic rights as a result of [[poverty]], violence or environmental degradation testify to the international community's failure to make this vision a reality." Mike Aaronson


"Growth for the sake of growth is the philosophy of the cancer cell." Edward Abbey


“If you want to do it quickly, do it alone. If you want to do it well, do it together.” - [[Africa, community action for sustainability|African]] proverb. 


"Our biggest challenge in this new century is to take an idea that seems abstract - sustainable development - and turn it into a reality for all the world's people" Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General


The Economic Conundrum of an Aging Population <br>"The shift to a stable population will increase the "dependency ratio" of old to young. While that may stem environmental decline, it could bring economic hardship to the countries that first achieve it. The only real chance of escaping this dilemma is to eliminate the huge economic inequities that now prevail in the world." Robert Ayres, Professor Emeritus of Management and Environment at the INSEAD European Business School <ref>[http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/2004/08/16/ World Watch Magazine, September/ October 2004]</ref>

"One of the things that we saw during the pilots, is that citizens realise how hard it is to build consensus and, furthermore, how hard it is to try to create a policy that fits all. How can this change democracy? It facilitates the understanding of how complex consensus, decision and policy-making are, how long it takes…

'''Democracy cannot longer be a ‘thing’ that we do once every x amount of years.''' You get good at being democratic the more often you practice it. Civic technologies are organised around participation, therefore granting the opportunity to get more experience, to assess different points of view, to build arguments, to accept we don’t know everything. Moreover, a grass-roots collection of data creates a very different landscape and understanding of cities by the citizens, at the very least this is why we feel it is worth doing."

"[[Sustainable development]] is never going to materialise as a result of edicts from [[New York City|New York]] or [[Geneva]]. It needs to be constructed, shared and implemented in a truly global way that takes account of traditional, local and non-Western approaches." Steve Bass, senior fellow at the [[International Institute for Environment and Development]] and former chief environment advisor at the [[UK]] government's Department for International Development.

"When I thought of Dialogue in this larger sense, I had the image of the open central courtyard in an old-fashioned, Latin American home… you could enter the central courtyard by going around and through any of the multiple arched entryways that surrounded this open, flower-filled space in the middle of the house… For me, Dialogue is like entering this central courtyard in the spacious home of our common human experience." Juanita Brown

"I have no illusions that we can simply declare a Law for the Commons.  The very idea and its variations must first be formulated for our modern context, and then fought for.  But at a time when existing regimes of law and governance are in a shambles – losing public respect, failing to meet people’s basic needs, destroying the Earth – I believe that commoning and laws to enable it have a bright future.  Commons can meet people’s needs in fair, open and effective ways, and provide a dignity, respect and equality that the market/state order has trouble achieving.  By cultivating more direct engagement with people, and demanding that they step up to responsibilities, commons also have great promise in improving ecological stewardship."

:"The ‘Web of Life’ is, of course, an ancient idea, which has been used by poets, philosophers, and mystics throughout the ages to convey their sense of the interwovenness and interdependence of all phenomena." 


:"Ultimately, deep ecological awareness is spiritual or religious awareness. When the concept of the human spirit is understood as the mode of consciousness in which the individual feels a sense of belonging, of connectedness, to the cosmos as a whole, it become clear that ecological awareness is spiritual in its deepest essence."

:"The global city is not [[London]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Tokyo]] or [[Johannesburg|Jo'berg]] -- it is the part of each which is connected to an analogous part in each of the others. The global city is a distributed phenomenon. There is only one global city, and it floats on top of the others like lace."

"We’re all very much aware that there are millions of young people who are unemployed, particularly in high–risk countries across the world, who form the majority of the population, and haven’t got a remote chance of ever getting a job. <br>I work on these issues with the Youth Employment Network of the [[United Nations]]. We know that one of the things that must be done urgently is to remove the economic, legal and regulatory impediments that many governments and societies impose on their own young people. <br>Angry young people without [[Opportunities for all|opportunities]] are good candidates for extremist and simplistic arguments." <br>Maria Cattaui

:"A human being is part of the whole, called by us 'Universe,' limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion is a prison, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons close to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from our prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all humanity and the whole of nature in it's beauty." 


:"For while knowledge defines all we currently know and understand, imagination points to all we might yet discover and create."

"Amid a frenzy of conspicuous consumption, an inconspicuous revolution has been stirring. A growing number of people are seeking a way of life that is more satisfying and sustainable. This quiet revolution is being called by many names, including voluntary simplicity and compassionate living. But whatever its name, its hallmark is a new common sense - namely, that life is too deep and consumerism is too shallow to provide soulful satisfaction." Duane Elgin


"The new media are orientated towards action, not contemplation; towards the present, not tradition. It is wrong to regard media equipment as mere means of consumption." Hans Magnus Enzensberger


"Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach... It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good." ~ Clarissa Pinkola Estes

"Where I live in [[Marin County]], it was citizen action that instigated the preservation of hundreds of thousands of acres as open space and parkland; it was not government taking the initiative. That mostly happened in the pre-Internet days. Now that we’ve got the Net and there’s more talent, creativity and freedom in the civic sector than in government, it’s time that citizens once again take the lead in building tools and solving problems for their localities." cfigallo <ref>[http://presilience.org/2009/04/07/hacking-the-local-infrastructure/ pResilience], April 7, 2009</ref> / [[Community involvement]]


"Building a world where we meet our own needs without denying future generations a [[health]]y society is not impossible, as some would assert. The question is where societies choose to put their creative efforts." Christopher Flavin


"All of it must begin with the 'whole'. When we open ourselves awe returns. This will get us out of the oppression of work. We need to return to nature rather than trying to master it. Our inner work is also community work. Schumacher: "We can each of us work to put our own inner houses in order". We should look at the inner houses of all the communities in which we live. We can do this through ritual and other forms of art. Part of it is letting go, particularly of self-pity. We need to move from a cynical society to a possible society. Business has the potential to lead the change. There is so much work needing to be done." Matthew Fox


"No one has ever become poor by giving." - Anne Frank
