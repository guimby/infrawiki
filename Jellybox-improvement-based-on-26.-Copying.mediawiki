Possible Solutions:
# A carousel of print beds for copying prints 
# Include the original designs for reprinting on an SD card
# Have the acrylic pieces be 3D printed
# A mechanical device that removes completed prints off the bed automatically
# Be able to print a mould for creating an extruder head
# Include a “Print Last” button
# Have a quantity button option: Print 1,2,3,4,5 of the file.
# Make a video of 3D printing materials 
# Instead of zip-tying pieces, they can snap together with 3d printed parts
# Give individuals a 3D printing online course
# Use basic string to attach the printer as opposed to zipties
# Use high tech scanner (built into printer) that copied 3d objects and creates stl files for them to be copied with the printer
# Offer the specs for the size of the box that holds the printer so someone can make their own case for it
# Have a “duplicate printer” option to reprint an entire printer except for the metal pieces and wires
# Have a connector cord that connects two printers. When printing something on one, it makes it print on the other simultaneously 
# Create a bigger printer that has a bigger print bed so that more can be printed at one time
# Be able to print a mould for most printable objects, which makes it faster to replicate
# Have a built in filament recycler that allows you to melt down used filament
