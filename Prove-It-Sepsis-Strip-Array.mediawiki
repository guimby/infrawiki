==Problem being addressed==
Infection is a large contributor to maternal mortality and morbidity in developing
countries. Nearly one third of all maternal deaths are attributed to infection,
which can easily be prevented by minor improvements in sterile child delivery practices and reduction of bacterial transmission. Additionally, improvements in the diagnosis of sepsis can help improve mortality rates as well.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This sepsis identification method uses a new microarray platform that determines
the type of bacteria through the use of antibiotics. The "microarray platform is a
series of microscopic spots of short DNA fragments whose sequences are specific
for individual organisms." Prove-It is highly accurate and produces results faster
than the current gold standard by 18 hours, allowing for rapid and effective
treatment of the infection. It is able to detect more than 60 species of gram negative and gram positive bacteria that most frequently cause sepsis. Additionally, the test can identify 13 fungal pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers.
