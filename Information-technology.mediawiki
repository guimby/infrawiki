==Introduction==
Various appropriate technologies in '''information and communication technology''' are mentioned at [[Wikipedia:Appropriate technology#Information and communication technology|the Wikipedia article on appropriate technology]], and some [[Appropedia:Ruleset#Encyclopedic_Content_Policy|encyclopedic]] articles are linked from there. 

== ICT in development ==

The term '''ICT4D''' (Information and Communication Technologies for Development) refers to the use of ICTs to support socio-economic development. Examples of this follow.

== Lean code, development and sustainability==

{{main|Sustainable computing}}

Computing can be made more sustainable in several ways. Better practices (like hibernation, screens switching off instead of going to screensavers, and just switching off or hibernating when the computer is not in use) can save power. More efficient coding means computers use less power and need less powerful hardware - see [http://blogs.appropedia.org/2008/12/05/the-world-needs-lean-code/ The world needs lean code!] (December 5th, 2008) on the Appropedia Foundation Blog.

==ICT in commerce==
Farmers in 
[[Uganda]]{{w|Uganda}} have used SMS ([[short message service]]{{w|short message service}} text messaging on mobile phones) to find out about the latest crop prices.<ref name="Africa's Mobile Success Story">[http://www.comminit.com/en/node/265616 The Un-wired Continent: Africa's Mobile Success Story], summary of a 7-page paper by Vanessa Gray, 2006 ''- The Communication Initiative Network''</ref> This service provides them with valuable information to negotiate with middlemen.

=== ICT in public health ===

In [[South Africa]]{{w|South Africa}}, the "Compliance Service" uses short message service (SMS) to remind [[tuberculosis]] (TB) patients to take their medication. This kind of intervention, which is claimed to have  "substantially decreased the number of treatment failures", has important implications in [[public health]].<ref name="Africa's Mobile Success Story"/>
