Can we [[federate]] [[wiki]] sites, so they interlink more effectively? This would retain some of the benefits of the "[[one big wiki]]" model, but may have some advantages in terms of workable-sized [[online communities]].

In brief: it is not yet possible, though there has been talk of it and at least one attempt at developing software for "[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Supporting_collaboration_in_branched_articles Supporting collaboration in branched articles]"

The remainder of this page has been moved to the Coalition of the Willing's wiki, at [http://cotw.cc/wiki/Distributed_wikis '''Distributed wikis''']. The article looks at steps needed, hacks to get some of the benefits in the meantime, and The "scary transclusion" hack, and the big wiki alternative. Please contribute any ideas or updates at that page.
