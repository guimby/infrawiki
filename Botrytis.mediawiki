'''Botrytis''' is a form of fungus that affects a wide range of plants. It is also known as grey mould (mold). Botrytis attacks leaves, buds and fruits of plants.

== Symptoms of botrytis ==

The following symptoms may indicate that a plant has been attacked by botrytis:

*Leaves: The leaves may yellow. The leaves may wilt or wither.
*Buds: The buds may be covered in a whitish powdery layer. They don't open.
*Fruits: The fruits may soften, turn a different colour and/or fall off.

You can also try shaking the plant. If it is affected by botrytis, you will see a shower of white powder or dust release from the plant.

== Preventing botrytis ==

Keep plants healthy. Botrytis tends to attack plants that are weak, wilting or already damaged by pest infestations or other forms of damage such as wounds or breaks in a plant.

Once the unhealthy plants are targeted, the healthy plants are affected. Thus, it is important to remove affected plants as quickly as possible.

== Treating botrytis ==

Remove the plants and dispose of them in the garbage. Do not place in the compost or place in garden piles, as this may distribute the fungus.

Improve the air circulation in the garden, to allow good airflow around and between plants.

Increase the nutrition for the plant.

You may wish to use an appropriate fungicide if the removal of affected plants does not work. [More details need to be added on this approach.]
