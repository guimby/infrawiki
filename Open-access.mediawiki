'''Open access''' materials can be viewed for free, but generally have other restrictions - for example no commercial use, no derivations, and (in some cases) no unauthorized distribution. The degree of "openness" can be star-rated according to meeting, or not, the four key criteria: there is no barrier to access for the reader, there is no fee demanded of the author/s, the copyright is nor forfeited by the author/s, and the work can be freely distributed<ref>Paull, J. (2013) [http://www.organic-systems.org/journal/81/8102.pdf "Open access publishing: What is world's best practice?"], Journal of Organic Systems, 8 (1), pp. 2-4.</ref>.

Thus if material is simply open access, it is not true [[open content]] and generally cannot be used on projects such as [[Appropedia]], [[OLPC]] [[OLPC content bundles|content bundles]], or Wikipedia. 

== Open content on Appropedia ==

{{main|Appropedia:Open access content on Appropedia}}

On Appropedia, sometimes open access materials help to fill gaps where we do not yet have adequate [[open content]] resources. These are clearly marked with the {{tl|open access}} notice, and categorized at  [[:Category:Open access pages]] - these are work [[port]]ed to Appropedia for which there is no clear permission to A. reuse for commercial purposes or B. modify.
