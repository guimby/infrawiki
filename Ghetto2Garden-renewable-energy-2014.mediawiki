==Background==
During the months of May through July in 2014, students from [[Humboldt State University]] in the [[Practivistas Dominicana Program]] are working in collaboration with Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE), Collectivo RevArk, and Ghetto2Garden. A group of five students consisting of [[User:Nac363|Noah Coor]], [[User:Jcingram|Jackson Ingram]], [[User:eklee|Emily Klee]], and [[User:Jeff mosbacher|Jeff Mosbacher]] are designing a project to provide solar energy that will power the electricity needs for Ghetto2Garden. Ghetto2Garden needs power for lighting, outlets, and a waterpump.

===How to recreate===
Step-by-step instructions on how this system was created.

====Materials Needed:====
[[File:G2GMaterialsandKey.png|center|750px|thumb]]

====Part 1: Sizing the System====
{{How to

 |header1= 
 |header2= 
 |pics= no
 |size= 
 |File:Default.png |Caption |1 |Determine the power consumption for all loads that the PV system will supply power to.
 |File:Default.png |Caption |2 |Use this [[Media:GeneralSolarSizingSpreadsheet.xlsx |spreadsheet]] to help determine how many modules and batteries you will need to use by plugging in the information from step 1. Do not solely rely on this excel spreadsheet for your final product, this is merely an approximation, be sure to get a second or third opinion from other sources on correct sizing. 
 |File:Default.png |Caption |3 |Determine the specifics for the inverter, charge controller, and all other electrical equipment that the system will need.

====Part 2: Assembling the System====
NOTE: Depending on which model charger controller you are using, the order of the wiring will vary. It is important that you follow the installation instructions stated in your charge controller manual.

===Design===
A diagram of the systems wiring connections can be referenced below.
[[File:G2GFinalDesign.JPG|thumb|center|450px|Diagram of Wiring Connections Illustrated by Jackson Ingram]]

==Operation==
The following is a guide to the maintenance of the solar power system as well as information about its operation. 

===Maintenance===
In order to keep this system up and running efficiently, periodic checks are mandatory. These check-ins involve inspecting the wires for all aspects of the system, and monitoring the solar charge controller. The panels must also be cleaned once a month, or after a storm in order to maintain panel efficiency. The batteries must also be replaced after their lifespan has ended.

===Instructions===
*When solar power is not needed, make sure switch is flipped to the right.
*When solar power is needed, flip switch to the left.
*During times of no sun, minimize energy consumption, and only use solar system when absolutely needed. Otherwise have switch flipped to the right.

==Conclusion==
The following section addresses the teams results for the system at Ghetto2Garden, and discusses the things that could be added to improve the system as well as instructions for future users to troubleshoot the system.

===Testing results===
Upon completion of the installation of the solar PV system at Ghetto2Garden, the team was successfully able to verify the working condition of the system. After turning on both the breakers, the final test was to turn on the loads, which successfully worked.

===Lessons learned===
Some of the lessons that we learned while installing the PV system at Ghetto2Garden are discussed below.

* The battery monitor should be installed across the entire of the battery bank in order to monitor the batteries, instead of just one, even though the batteries are wired in series.
* Plan ahead and contact the people helping you install the system at least a day in advance to assure that you have the correct tools for the job. 
* Always over-estimate the load that your system will need to produce. A little bit more electricity produced than is necessary is better than not having enough electricity.
* Follow the instructions that come with the solar charge controller, because the order of which you connect the wires to the controller matter. 
* Our team learned a lot about the difference between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) current and how to wire the two different types. Specifically, make sure you have a bigger gauge of wire for the DC aspect of your system as opposed to the AC aspect of your system. The reasoning for this is that DC drops in voltage over a long distance, where AC can have smaller wires and can travel over much larger distances.
* Create a way for the panels that are laying flat on the ground to be raised up in order to create airflow underneath the panels when they get hot.

===Next steps===
The following are additional steps that groups in the future can do to improve upon the system at Ghetto2Garden.
* Install a mounting system for the panels, that will also secure them from any possible theft. For help with this step, contact Tito from La Yuca, who has some ideas in mind.
* Disconnect the battery monitor and connect it to the entire battery bank, instead of just one battery. 
* Add a label for the battery monitor that says to flip the switch to the grid (to the right) once it reads a certain voltage, to allow the batteries to recharge.

===Troubleshooting===
Below is a chart that details some problems and solutions for the charge controller and other PV system components.

|-
|System is not providing power for as long as usual. 
|Batteries are becoming worn down. 
|Replace batteries.
|-
|System is providing little power. 
|Batteries may be drained .
|Turn off solar power and allow for recharge of batteries. 
|-
|System does not work.

===A New Year a New Solar Practivistas Team===
A year had passed and the 2015 solar practivistas team traveled to the remote location of Ghetto2garden to see how the 2014 installation has held up. Throughout the six week project, we traveled to Ghetto2garden three times. The first time was to touch bases with Tomas about he system throughout the past year, analyze the functionality of the system, and retrieve any components that were in need of repair. We had only planned on going to Ghetto2garden twice but  on the second trip more issues arose. The third and last trip to G2G time was spent tying up loose ends and a fully functioning solar energy system was established once again. <br>

To learn more about what the 2015 solar team accomplished, go to [[Practivistas_solar_2015]]

====What Went Wrong====
In our first visit, the team was informed that rats had gotten to the inverter so Tomas and his crew had taken apart some of the system components to try and fix it. In the process of rewiring these components, it was rewired incorrectly and the inverter still needed to be fixed. In the second trip, the team discovered that the charge controller was also broken but the cause was unknown. The batteries were wired incorrectly, two negative terminals were connected and two positive terminals were connected. After the two visits, what G2G needed to do was fix the inverter, fix the charge controller, and rewire the system.

 |File:inverter_broken.jpg |Caption |1| Arriving to ghetto2garden, the system was analyzed and we were told it had been completely taken apart and rewired incorrectly. The inverter was broken so it was decided to fix the inverter and continue with follow up maintanence on the entire system on the next trip.

 | | | |
 | | | |
 | | | |
|File:Fixing.jpg |Caption |2| The team had fixed the inverter and was ready to return and follow up on the maintanence checks. When returning, it was realized the state of system was worse due to rats chewing through wires and the charge controller was not functioning. Luckily the panels and the rest of the system were working perfectly fine. The batteries were wired incorrectly but then once reconnecting them positive to negative and they started working. The lightning arrester needed to be rewired and fixed up, along with the charge controller.

 | | | |
|File:Charger.jpg |Caption |3| Unfortunately, the charge controller was beyond repair and it needed to be replaced. The previous charge controller was 35 amps/24 volts and the new charge controller was 30 amps/48 Volts.  We drove to ghetto2garden for the last time and reinstalled the components, rewired the lightning Arrestors and removed ground fault protection.

===Our Brief Time in Ghetto2Garden===
Throughout the three trips to G2G, the solar team learned with everyone the wiring  of a system and how each component is wired together precisely with the assistance of Tito (an electrician from La Yuca). After many sweaty hours, many animals and many mangoes, the solar energy system was fully functioning again. Although our time with Tomas and his partners was very brief it was greatly enjoyed and I'm sure they look forward to future solar practivistas to return.<br />
