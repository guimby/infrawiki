==Introduction==
These are pallet houses constructed in [[Haiti Communitere]]. Haiti Communitere is a resource center that facilitates projects with the intent to influence positive development in Haiti. These pallet houses are an example of how old "waste" material can be [[upcycling|upcycled]] to created useful materials or structures. Each pallet house was constructed using pallet wood. They were built on top of a shipping container, and both have a unique aesthetic that makes them appealing. Aesthetics are often important when using old waste material to build with, since the appearance of waste material may deter some from living in or building upcycled structures.
