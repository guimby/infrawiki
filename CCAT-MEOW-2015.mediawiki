==Abstract==
The Mobile Energy Operation Wagon ([[MEOW]]) is a mobile source of energy for events. It 
generates renewable energy through the solar panels and the bikes attached to it. Since 
the MEOW was vandalized in the past, it was in need of new batteries and a change in 
the position of the battery case. The following project was conducted by a group of 
Humboldt State University students in the spring of 2015 in order to prolong the life of 
the new batteries and reestablish the MEOW to working order.

==Background== 
[[File:20150129 142150.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2| This is the interior of [[MEOW]] as of January 29th 2015 with the bikes and solar panels.]]
[[File:20150129 142201.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2| This is the [[MEOW]]'s electronic system and battery case in the upright position.]]
The Mobile Energy Operation Wagon or [[MEOW]] is a trailer that has mounted solar panels that generate renewable energy and stores that energy in batteries. The [[MEOW]] is currently located on the Humboldt State University campus at the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology or [[CCAT]]. The [[MEOW]] was constructed in 2003 to be transportable renewable energy source for a variety of events, specially CCAT May Day festivities <ref name="Wagon Stolen">http://www.times-standard.com/20110125/ccat-recovers-mobile-energy-wagon-board-meets-to-discuss-future-of-meow-after-it-was-stolen-vandalized-last-month </ref>. Sadly in 2010 the [[MEOW]] was stolen and stripped of all valuable materials and the solar mounting rack built in May of 2005 was ruined <ref name="Solar Rack"> http://www.appropedia.org/CCAT_MEOW_rack </ref> <ref name="Wagon Stolen"/>.  Fortunately, funding was able to be gathered to help bring the [[MEOW]] back on its paws! In May 2012, a new mounting rack for the solar panels was constructed and attached to the MEOW<ref name="MEOW">http://www.appropedia.org/CCAT_MEOW </ref>. In November of 2012, a group students rejuvenated the [[MEOW]]’s solar energy system <ref name="MEOW"/>. The [[MEOW]] may have more history of work done but because the binder in the [[CCAT]] library was no where to be found, little information is known beyond the digital information stored on other Appropedia pages. 


Three students from [[Humboldt State University]], [[User:Desimac100|Destinee McGuire]], [[User:jcylwik1|John Cylwik]], and [[User:Wilsinn92|Wilson Franca de Souza]], are tasked with the job of restoring the system to working condition. There is a visible issue with the batteries housing units which appear to be slightly bulging. The batteries were tested and found to not be holding a charge. Since the batteries contain hazardous chemicals, there is a possibility of damaging the environment, humans, and the [[MEOW]]. So new batteries need to be purchased to get the [[MEOW]] up and running properly.   

[[File:Battery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2| This is one of the batteries that was being used for the [[MEOW]] and the photo is not detailed enough to show the slight bulging.]]


The project was developed from January 26 2015 to May 2015 (Spring 2015). 
Humboldt State University is located in Northern California in the United States. The 
University is located next to the City of Arcata. This region is a coastal zone with mild 
weather with high humidity throughout most the year.

==Problem statement==
The objective of this project is to restore the Mobile Energy Operation Wagon ([[MEOW]]) to working condition for [[CCAT]] by assessing the problems with the solar system setup and changing the battery case position to retain battery lifespan.

== Literature Review == 
   
Looking to better understand the [[MEOW]]’s system and components, the following literature review was built before we started to work on the project. Solar energy, types of batteries, bikes and sun potential were the major subjects of research.

===Battery===
The use of batteries in an off-grid system is the way to store energy produced to use later. Looking to order new batteries for the MEOW, different types of batteries were  searched, such as nickel metal hydride, AGM, lithium, and others.


During our research, we found a study about the nickel metal hydride (NMH) batteries. In this study, scientists discovered that some charging energy is converted into heat and used to expand gases, and overcharging can cause damages to the battery. Overcharging should be eliminated. The system presented in the study was a mobile unit that was used to broadcast radio which is similar to the [[MEOW]]. <ref name="Solar photovoltaic"> Abdurakhmanov, K. P., O. Ochilov, and A. G. Strizhevskii. 2008. Solar photovoltaic battery charger for mobile radio stations.Applied Solar Energy 44, (4) (12): 249-255, http://ezproxy.humboldt.edu/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/231325042?accountid=11532 (accessed February 4, 2015). /></ref> The overcharging problem could be fixed easily by setting the [[MEOW]]’s system to not overcharge the batteries; however, the heat generated by the batteries could be a risk to the [[MEOW]] because there is no temperature control in the [[MEOW]] trailer. 


Many people have compared the specs of different batteries for different uses. This quote is just one that describes come differences; “There is more to comparing batteries than just cost or amp-hour ratings. For example, based only on cost, the Concorde AGM's do not look so good. On the other hand, you probably would not want to store a flooded battery in your computer room. There is no one best battery for all applications. If the batteries are in a remote communications site, low maintenance might be the most important feature. For the off-grid full time home, capacity. life, and long term cost would probably be the most important.”<ref name="Deep Cycle Battery">"Northern Arizona Wind & Sun." Deep Cycle Battery Types Comparisons. www.solar-electric.com/deep-cycle-battery-types-comparisons.html./></ref>Furthermore, since the MEOW is an off-grid system, the lifespan and maintenance of the new batteries would need to be considered and probably a more critical aspect of the batteries. 


Looking at what people have bought and used was another avenue to gather information. Rechargeable batteries sales throughout the world included Nickel-cadmium, Nickel metal hydride, and lithium-ion batteries from 1986 to 2005. Lithium-ion batteries were the largest part of the sales in 2005. the cadmium batteries are still used but in fewer quantity because of the possible heavy metal exposure. For cadmium batteries, an estimated lifespan of 15 years for industrial batteries, 6 years for electric vehicle batteries, and 3 years for consumer batteries.<ref name="Cadmium">Wilburn, D2007. Flow of Cadmium from Rechargeable Batteries in the United States, 1996-2005. Reston, Va.: U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey./> </ref> The [[MEOW]] batteries would be under the category of vehicle use and the 6 year lifespan is optimal for the [[CCAT]] standards. 


The three previous paragraphs were from research to find the right batteries to buy for the [[MEOW]]. [[CCAT]] decided on seal lead acid batteries based on a good price from a dealer who gave them a discount.

===Solar===
The use of solar energy as a renewable source is growing all around the world. According to Robert Hill, the "Deployment of renewable energy sources can be a key feature of regional development and assists in achieving greater social and economic cohesion within a country. Grid extension, noise and pollution are avoided in PV projects. In both centralised and decentralised systems, adverse visual impact is also avoidable with sensitive design."

The article reports that solar developers and contractors are gearing up for new sector growth as more U.S. states allow direct sale of solar power to electricity customers. It reveals that utilities and regional firms are eyeing on smaller but mass-volume rooftop solar installations for residential, commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. The opportunities for growth in the residential market are highlighted.<ref name="Rooftop Solar"> Carr, Housley. "Rooftop Solar Set To Soar." Engineering News-Record, October 2, 2013, 8. /></ref>
With the several types of energy storage systems and the range of requirements for the various services categories, it can be difficult to determine the suitability of a system for a given application. Discharge time of a system is one characteristic that can immediately identify possible options for a given application. By comparing the stored energy quantity and power requirements of the application with the characteristics of the battery technologies, one or more suitable types may be identified. Following this process, battery technologies can be compared on other merits such as cycle life, cost, and efficiency.”<ref name="Battery Selection">Leadbetter, Jason, and Lukas G. Swan.

Photovoltaic solar energy is one of the most widely used renewable energy. A key component in photovoltaic generation systems is the DC-AC converter [1,2]. In these applications multilevel inverters are usually used. These can give an AC voltage from several DC sources, that is, from the photovoltaic generators. Multilevel inverters have lower output harmonic content monolevel inverters.”<ref name="Inverters"> Reinoso, C.r. Sanchez, M. De Paula, D.h. Milone, and R.h. Buitrago.

In Medford Oregon, the average yearly insolation availability in kWH/m^2 for a fixed panel with a latitude tilt of -15 degree is 4.88. This is the closest latitudinal location to Arcata California. For a tracking array, the available insolation averages 6.5 kWH/m^2. Knowing the solar insolation is very helping in determining the solar panel systems potential throughout the year.   
	Inverters are an important aspect to an electrical system because it dictates the wave output (square, modified sine, or sine) and affects the efficiency.<ref name="Stand-Alone">Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems: A Handbook of Recommended Practices. Las Cruces: Photovoltaic Design Assistance Center Sandia National Laboratories, 1995./></ref>

===Bike===

The [[MEOW]] has the potential of having bicycles being used to charge the batteries. A little research was conducted in case the project got ahead of schedule and the bikes were able to be hooked up. Biking is the most energy-efficient way to travel compared to animals and machines. During the Race Across America, the average efficiency was about 20% which is fantastic and in no reach of fossil fuel cars.  
374 calories are required to produce 100 W per hour and the average person can produce about 0.75 W for several hours and 225 W when pressing hard for a few minutes. A physically fit cyclist can produce 375 W for a few minutes and 525 W for up to a minute.<ref name="Bike Power">Perry, David. 1995. Bike Cult : The Ultimate Guide to Human-powered Vehicles. New York: Four Walls Eight Windows./> </ref> The numbers for bike power is very impressive and a wonderful option for the [[MEOW]].

== Operation ==
The [[MEOW]] has another Appropedia page dedicated to care and use of the [[MEOW]]. This page can be accessed here [[CCAT MEOW/OM]]. Previously, the page had included the information of equalizing the batteries. This is not recommended for sealed batteries, as indicated in the user manual of the solar system, and this could drastically shorten the lifespan of the batteries. To prevent the EQ setting, do not access the setting. The default system set up is without a EQ phase in the charging of the batteries. This was verified with the manufacture of the Outback system installed in the trailer.

===Maintenance===
With the gel cell battery there is little to no maintenance on the batteries.  If there is any visual corrosion on the battery terminal (green/blue/white-ish) use a steel brush or sand paper to clean the battery terminals.  

The battery box is bolted down with 10 bolts make sure that there is no visible rust or damage to the bolts.  Underneath the trailer there are 2- 2X4" boards visually inspect and feel for wood rot, if rot is present replace the board.  

There are 10 locking nuts under the trailer as well which attach to the bolts.  '''These are one time use only nuts.'''  There is a rubber locking device inside the locking nut, once it is in place it should stay there.  If a nut comes loose discard the locking nut and replace it with another locking nut.

Inspect trailer frame for rust and replace damaged parts

Inspect all wood, floorboards and walls, for any decay or wood rot and replace as needed.

===Schedule===
The [[MEOW]] has a maintenance schedule that was created;[[CCAT MEOW/OM]]. This is a very in depth schedule of when to do maintenance and when to conduct the checks. 


===Instructions===

}}

==Conclusion==
The battery case position change was not difficult to accomplish. The most challenging aspect was getting the authorization to drill into the MEOW. The construction was smooth except for the loss of a 1/2 inch socket which caused John to use a 1/2 inch wrench to tighten the bolts down. The socket was found after the construction was completed. Research for new batteries was conducted to aid in the help of ordering new batteries. This process was hard to deal with because the communication chain took a while. The batteries purchased were not any of the specific brands researched but [[CCAT]] was able to negotiate a deal for the price. The best price they could find with the specification the MEOW needed. The [[MEOW]] was working for the May Day Festival and some visitors that were very interested in what the [[MEOW]] was. The [[MEOW]] is, as of May of 2015, up and running.   

===Testing results===
We have tested the system with a clock and a blender, both items worked properly. Also some other electrical appliances were tested and worked properly. The voltage readings were normal once a load was on the system. 

[[File:Thing plugged in.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Some electrical device John found to plug into the MEOW]]

===Discussion===
We found out during testing that we could not get a solid voltage reading from the outlet.  With some advice from our teacher we found out that the system can determine either AC or DC is required to power another system.  

One bike is currently in the trailer is operational and will help charge the batteries. Hopefully the other two bikes could be fixed up and used to get people excited about creating renewable energy. 

'''Do Not''' Plug In To The Grid To Charge The MEOW!

===Lessons Learned===
The MEOW project was huge! So many ideas were thrown around of what was wanted to be done. The main goal was to get the MEOW up and running but deciding on how to tackle the project was difficult. The idea process was great but getting feedback and approval on the ideas was challenging. The communication to the client should have had more frequency because of the limited times the client meet together. Construction was delayed and little testing was able to be done on the MEOWS charging potential with the new batteries.  Contacting the system manufacture for basic system setting, modes, and proper set up for use with the correct batteries.

===Next Steps===

[[File:Wilson on a bike.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Wilson on one of the stationary bikes that could be used to charge the batteries.]]
The MEOW is a large project and has many possibilities. Another team could work on re-establishing the bike power that was once associated with charging the batteries. Many people at the May Day Festival were mentioning the bike power ad would like to see it return. Another potential project would be doing maintenance on the trailer the solar system is housed in. The interior floor could use new paint, the trailer is starting to rust due to the humidity in Humboldt, and spiders seem to making the MEOW their home. These are just two potential next steps for the life of the MEOW.


===Troubleshooting===
Turn the system off. Then turn it back on.  

If that does not work follow the operations manual troubleshooting section toward the end of the booklet (the manual is located in the [[MEOW]]).

Or, if worse comes to worse, call the system manufacturer and ask for a walk through some troubleshooting. The company is very friendly and happy to guide you to the proper system settings.
