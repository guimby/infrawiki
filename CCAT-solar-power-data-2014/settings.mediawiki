This is a temporary page to document the appropriate settings to get the Raspberry Pi, Aurora, and PVOutput.org working.

==Raspberry Pi settings==
To figure out which port the USB-serial converter is connected to, go to the Terminal (lower-left "start" icon, Accessories, LXTerminal). In the Terminal, type:
dmesg | grep ttyUSB
(the | character is a pipe, usually typed by hitting shift-backslash)

It will probably be ttyUSB0. Remember this for the next section.

==Aurora Settings==
===Setup===
* Serial port: Probably /dev/ttyUSB0 (see the Raspberry Pi section above if incorrect)
* Inverter address: 2 (set by the Aurora Inverter; can be changed by connecting to it with a Windows laptop and the Aurora Communicator software)

===Inverter Settings===
* Check the "Auto retrieve 5 minute energy data"

===PVOutput.org===
* URL: http://pvoutput.org/service/r2/ (subject to future change; check pvoutput.org for updates)
* System ID: 28922 (from http://pvoutput.org/account.jsp)
* API Key: hidden because private, but you can also get it from http://pvoutput.org/account.jsp
* Live updates: 5 minutes
* Checkboxes: Check all 3 (include blah blah blah)
