==Overview==
[http://www.getbehindthemule.com Get Behind The Mule] is a website that uses current social networking technology to connect communities focusing on sustainability for Northern California and Southern Oregon.  Connecting chefs with local produce growers, small diameter wood producers with local contractors, educators with entrepreneurs, elected officials with policy interest groups and more.

=Goals=
Efficient exchanges of knowledge and products are the fundamental goals of this project.  We also believe that within the conversations that take place some yeast will develop that will lead to new alliances being formed where they did not exist before. 

Membership from both within the Nor Cal / Southern Oregon area is encouraged as well as technical membership and communication from outside of the area.
