'''Low emissivity''' is used to describe a coating of thin metal that is placed on the inside of a pane of glass, in a window. This thin layer of metal is between the panes of glass and helps reflect thermal radiation into the room. It is often seen used with an argon gas between the panes to further reduce heat loss.
