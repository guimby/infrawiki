{{topic header| Recycling symbol.svg |Recycling}}
'''Recycling''' can refer to one of the following:
* to use a product for a new purpose without changing the essential form, or by altering it minimally
* to use a product with a new user (ie by giving away a product to someone else, see [[Reuse]] and [[Freeganism]])
* to collect and process used materials to make new products.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/recycle Definition of recyling]</ref>

==Reusing==
A number of on-line services exist to allow people to give away items they no longer use and permit others to benefit from them. In example:
*[http://ilovefreegle.org Freegle]
*[http://www.freecycle.org/ Freecycle]
*[http://www.ecofreek.com Ecofreek] is a search engine that searches the web for free and 'for swap/trade' items people no longer need from over 45+ major sources.

==Making new products==
In many cases, waste products are used to create saleable products and generate income. See for example:
* [[3Cycle]]
* [[Recycling and dengue fever in Sukunan, Indonesia]]
* [http://www.theffrc.com/ The Flip Flop Recyling Project]
* [http://www.trashilicious.com/ Thrashilicious.com]

Such collection and remanufacture prevents waste, limits the need to extract new raw materials, reduces energy usage while minimizing air and water pollution from traditional forms of waste disposal. In some situations (ie Flip Flop Recycling Project) they also clean up litter found in nature. Many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles and electronics are recyclable. While [[composting]] of food or garden waste, either in home gardens or through central municipal facilities, is very worthwhile, we do not usually think of composting as falling within the scope of recycling.
