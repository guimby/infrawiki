Analytical devices can be produced at very low cost from simple materials. Applications are vast revolutionary, and include medical tests, environmental sensing, agriculture, soil science and many more. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics Microfluidics] refers to a set of technologies that control the flow of minute amounts of liquids or gases—typically measured in nano- and picoliters — in a miniaturized system. With these "chips", room-sized diagnostic testing equipment can be shrunk down to the size of a postage stamp. 

==Materials and Equipment Used== 
consumables: blotter paper, regular paper, wax paper, [http://www.shrinkydinks.com/ shrinky-dink], transparency film, cotton thread, sewing needles, wood sticks, [http://www.physorg.com/news195910096.html Jell-O], ?beeswax?,

==George Whitesides, Harvard University==
In his legendary career in chemistry, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Whitesides George Whitesides] has been a pioneer in [http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/research.html microfabrication and nanoscale self-assembly]. Now, he's fabbing a diagnostic lab on a chip.
