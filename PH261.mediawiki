'''Welcome to PH261: Physics of Energy and the Environment'''

PH261 is the foundation course for the Clarion University's Sustainability: Science and Policy Program and is taught by [[User:J.M.Pearce | Dr. Joshua Pearce]].

This course is a study of the physical laws and processes that underlie environmental phenomena with a special focus on [[energy]] (mechanical, thermal and electrical). We will establish both a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the underlying physical processes. Technical, economic, and social consequences of these laws and processes will be examined to better delineate the complex decisions related to human energy use and environmental issues.

This course is being offered on the web in Fall 2007 and will utilize appropedia.org for project collaboration.

The class list can be found here: [[Category:PH261|Class list]]

== Environmental Songs ==
To learn the basics of wiki editing and to have a little fun we created a list of [[environmental songs | songs with environmental themes]]

== Light Emitting Diode Project ==
Here is an [[LED FAQ]] to assist you in writing to the decision maker in you community.

[[LED]]s are the future of lighting.

== Review for Second Exam ==
Choose TWO words (or phrases) from the list below. Tag the word with your signature by editing this section of this page.

'''Create the page for the word and do the following:'''
* Write a definition for it using your book and class materials (e.g. lectures). 
* To like to a Wikipedia article, you can use an "interwiki link," e.g. <nowiki>[[Wikipedia:Foo]]</nowiki> to link to a Wikipedia article called "Foo". (Similar interwiki links can be made for Wikibooks, Wikiversity and many other wikis.) You can make a section called == Interwiki links == before the External links section, if you wish.
* Place the text <nowiki>[[</nowiki>Category:''PH261'']]
* Place your page in the appropriate categories using <nowiki>[[</nowiki>Category:''Category name'']]
* Link key words in your page to those of other appropedia site pages using the double brackets
* If you use outside sources cite them by sticking the url in between single brackets.
* Make sure you tag the artcle with your signature <nowiki>--~~~~</nowiki>
* Also make sure you check the "Watch this page" box - so when editors or myself make changes you will see them.
* Finally include <nowiki> {{PH261 Page}}</nowiki> in your page -- this will put a big blue box in it warning others from editing it until I have graded it -- when I have graded it I will remove the box.

== Final Class Project ==
The following is a list of pages created by PH261 students in alphabetical order. List your page and link back to it. Make sure to include the "PH261 Page" box in your page , just copy and paste the following (including brackets) code into your page: {{tl|PH261 Page}} This will ensure that no editors of Appropedia edit it before it is graded.

Students please note that the naming convention in Appropedia is to capitalize the first word of a phrase and then use lower case for the other words in a phrase. '''If you choose a topic that exists already -- look at the pages and see if you can find some aspect of the entry that can be improved based on the information from the class.'''
