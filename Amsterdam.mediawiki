[[wikipedia:Cycling in Amsterdam]]: Amsterdam is the most bicycle-friendly capital city in the world. In Amsterdam, over 60% of trips are made by bike in the inner city and 38% of trips are made by bike overall in the greater city area. Though to people outside of the Netherlands, Amsterdam is considered one of most famous and important centres of bicycle culture worldwide, in contrast to other, smaller Dutch cities, Amsterdam is actually not at the top in terms of bike-friendliness. For instance, Amsterdam is not on the short-list for the Fietsstad 2014 (BikeCity 2014) awards, announced by the Dutch Fietsersbond (Cyclists' Union). The cities of The Hague, Eindhoven and Almere are on this list for 2014 while the Netherlands' most bicycle-friendly city of Groningen won the award back in 2001.
