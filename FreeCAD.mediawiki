'''FreeCAD''' is a parametric 3D modeler. Parametric modeling allows you to easily modify your design by going back into your model history and changing its parameters. FreeCAD is [[open source]] (LGPL license) and completely modular, allowing for very advanced extension and customization.

FreeCAD is multiplatfom, and reads and writes many open file formats such as STEP, IGES, STL and others.
