The '''InfoLadies''' of [[Bangladesh]] carry a [[netbook]] [[computer]] and [[medical supplies]] on their [[bicycle]] and cycle from village to village dail, giving millions of [[poor]] people access to crucial information to improve their [[health]] and lives.

They use information from the internet info to teach hygiene, help in childbirth, share information about common health problems and crops, and more.
