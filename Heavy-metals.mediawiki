[[Bioremediation- Can offer a good and reliable method to remove Heavy metals and this includes Arsenic from water both for house hold consumption as well as from Industry.]]A good [[water treatment]] process, such as a reliable filter, should remove ''[[heavy metals]]'' from a water supply. Heavy metals are almost entirely attached to particles (as are bacteria, to a large degree).

[[Arsenic]] should not be confused with heavy metals - arsenic needs an entirely different kind of treatment.
