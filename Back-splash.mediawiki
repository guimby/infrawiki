*Stainless steel
*Glass mosaic
*Mosaic tiles
*Glass
*Glass and wallpaper
*Glass bricks
*Toughened glass{{fact}}
*Laminated glass{{fact}}

Stub note: All of the above resources need to be referenced and their sustainability factor confirmed. It is probable that there are other materials needing to be added to the list.
