'''Leapfrogging''' in [[industry]] occurs when new radical [[technological]] [[innovations]] are adopted by new firms ready to bear the risk.

More broadly, it can refer to a new technology reaching some contexts before an older technologies - such as [[mobile phones]] in parts of Africa which have never had [[landline]] phones.

[[LED lighting]] and [[microgeneration]] of [[renewable energy]] are among the [[green]] examples of potential leapfrog technologies currently gaining ground.

== Need for leapfrogging ==

City dwellers long to see the stars.

The [[rural poor]] wish they had [[street lights]], to walk [[safe]]ly and comfortably at night, and to see their surroundings.

In many cases, the rural poor do not need to pass through the same experiences as the wealthy nations, only to realize they want something else. There are often better options that can be achieved sooner, e.g. lower street lights that lighten the pathways, without hiding the stars.
