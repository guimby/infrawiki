It is planned to develop a comprehensive set of '''country guides''' on [[Appropedia]]. These will help to prepare and equip [[aid and development workers]], both paid and [[voluntary]], before and during their work, and act as a resource whenever needed.

You may start the country guide for a particular location ([[country]] or [[region]]). In time a structure will be developed. 

== General pages ==

Every "country guide" will include information on general issues of [[culture]] and preparation needs. [[Resources for aid and development workers]] is the starting point - perhaps a guide will simply point to this page, highlighting certain pages as essential reading.

Also some of these pages from [[:Category:Culture and development]] will be important:
* [[Cultural exchange in international development]]
* [[Dignity of program participants]]
* [[Making and correcting mistakes]]
* [[Poverty, inequality and cruelty]]
* [[Rubber time]]

Depending on the intended project, some more specific pages will be useful:
* [[Cultural preferences in sanitation]]
* [[Food equity within the household]]
