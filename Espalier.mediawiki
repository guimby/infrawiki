Espalier is a centuries-old horticultural technique to grow fruit trees in a "flat" way, and often against a wall. The main advantage is that space requirements are minimized. This technique is more labor intensive than regular fruit growing and requires more knowledge and care. However, there are also advantages, such as easier fruit picking and simpler netting to protect fruits from birds and other pests. The espalier trees are also highly ornamental. Suitable are apples, pears, apricots, peaches and many others. These trees may be grown in high latitudes against a sunny wall, which will serve as a heat buffer.
