The '''German''' (or ''''Magic'''') '''mound''' [[compost]]ing method is a good way of dealing with excess amounts of woody garden wastes, e.g., prunings, hedge clippings, [[brassica]] stems, [[brashwood]], etc.

In summary, the technique involves digging a circular trench about 1' deep and 5' wide, in the centre of which is dug another 1' deep hole into which the
rough material is piled. [[turf | Turves]]  are then stacked face down onto this pile, then layers of compost, well rotted leaves, [[manure]], etc. are added. The layers gradually break down slowly releasing nutrients and creating rich
[[humus]] over four or five years; this is ideal for growing hungry crops such as [[courgette]]s or [[Strawberry|strawberries]].
