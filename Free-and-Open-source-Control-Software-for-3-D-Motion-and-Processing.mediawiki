'''Franklin''' is a [[RepRap]] driver developed by [[User:Wijnen]]. This is software for controlling a [[RepRap]] 3-D printer, created by the [[Michigan Tech Open Sustainable Technology Lab]] (MOST).

* Franklin was tested on the following RepRap devices: Mendel RepRap, Delta RepRap, OS laser welder, PCB micromill, and the [[open source metal 3-D printer]].

==Abstract==
RepRap 3-D printers and their derivatives using conventional firmware are limited by: 1) requiring technical knowledge, 2) poor resilience with unreliable hardware, and 3) poor integration in complicated systems.  In this paper, a new control system called Franklin, for CNC machines in general and 3-D printers specifically, is presented that enables web-based three dimensional control of additive, subtractive and analytical tools from any Internet connected device. Franklin can be set up and controlled entirely from a web interface; it uses a custom protocol which allows it to continue printing when the connection is temporarily lost, and allows communication with scripts.
