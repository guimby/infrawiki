'''Noise pollution''' is often associated with modern, unsustainable technology. More sustainable technologies often have the added benefit of less noise. 

* An electric street car makes much less noise than the vehicles it replaces; 
* An [[electric cars|electric]] or [[hybrid car]] makes much less noise than a vehicle powered by [[fossil fuel]].
* [[Cycling]] and [[walking]] create even less noise.
* In an [[off-the-grid]] context, solar and wind power create much less noise than a typical [[electric generator]].
