'''Nematodes''', commonly known as roundworms, are one of the commonest groups of animals, found in most land, freshwater, and marine environments. Of over 80,000 known species, about 15,000 are [[parasite|parasitic]]. Nematodes are classified as members of the phylum Nematoda. 

Various types of free-living (non-parasitic) nematodes feed on [[algae]], [[fungi]], small animals, [[fecal matter]], and [[carrion]]. Nematodes are an important component of the decomposition system. Some species are considered to be crop pests, while others are ''predators'' of crop pests.

Parasitic nematodes exhibit a great variety of lifestyles, and depending on species may infest humans, animal species, or may move from one to the other. 

Some nematodes parasitic on humans include:

*''[[Ascaris lumbricoides]]'', which lives in the [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[digestive system]]s and causes the widespread disease [[ascariasis]]
*[[filarids]]
*[[hookworms]]
*[[pinworms]]
*[[whipworms]] 


Others:

*''[[Baylisascaris]]'' 
*''[[Haemonchus contortus]]'', commonly infests [[sheep]] worldwide. 
*''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' (trichina worm), cause of [[trichinosis]]; infests humans, [[pig]]s, and [[rat]]s.
