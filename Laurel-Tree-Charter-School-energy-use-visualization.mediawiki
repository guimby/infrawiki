== Abstract ==
The Lonely Protons' goal for this project is to provide Laurel Tree Charter School with an energy monitoring system that shows energy consumption in a way that was both interesting and understandable to students of all ages.

== Introduction ==
The Lonely Protons is a group of two Humboldt State University Environmental Resources Engineering students in the Fall 2012 ENGR 215 design class. Our design project is to create a way for the students and faculty of Laurel Tree Charter School to be able to visually see their energy consumption at the school in a way that is understandable to students of all ages (K-12.) The solution decided upon by the Lonely Protons and Laurel Tree is to use a combination of arduinos and an intuitive optical colored display to express energy usage. Energy usage data will be obtained at the building source (breaker box) and sent to a micro-controller that will then use a color changing light source to illuminate a quartz crystal with colored light, thus indicating energy usage based on color.

== Problem Statement and Criteria ==
The students of Laurel Tree Charter School had no clear means of monitoring their electrical usage.

|-
|Safety
|97
|The project will be in a school; it is of utmost importance that it is safe, and that malfunctions or general operation not be harmful to students or physical items.
|-
|Show Energy in Interesting Way
|90
|It was determined that the project had to be visually interesting, or it wouldn't be utilized as much as desired.
|-
| Understandable By All Ages
| 83
| The project also had to indicate energy usage in a way that anyone of school age could understand.
|-
| Achievable Within Allotted Time-frame
| 77
| The alternative solutions developed showed The Lonely Protons that feasibility of the project was also important; if the project was not finish-able in the time frame allotted, the goal would not be met.
|-
| Durability and Maintenance
| 57
| The Lonely Protons want the project to last for at least five years, and for any general maintenance to be perform-able by anyone with general knowledge and ability to follow directions given by the Lonely Protons. 
|-
| Cost
| 17
| Cost was listed as a low priority as The Lonely Protons could not exceed budget even if desired; however, time spent fundraising would distract from time spent on research and construction.
