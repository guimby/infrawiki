The term '''Energy descent''' refers to descent from [[peak oil]]. See for example [http://transitionculture.org/?p=318]. '''Oil descent''' might be a more precise term. Precisely what will happen during the inevitable decrease in oil production depends on whether or not effective methods of capturing [[solar energy]] are developed. The global economy, and the modern 'way of life', is built upon affordable, abundant conventional oil.
