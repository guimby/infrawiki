Hi! I'm Lysa, also known as Dazzle! on the playa. I'm doing Hexayurt tours at Burning Man this year on Tuesday and Wednesday at 3:00 in Silicon Village. located at 6:00 between D and F (we are a big theme camp and have a double block).  I know my tours conflict with happy hour but hey, its the playa.  Most of my tour will be of hexayurts in our village, but I am open to venturing out. Will be discussing materials, options, and styles.  Might have a "hexayurt happens" stamp if I can get it together. Will serve Gin and Tonics if I can get it together.
