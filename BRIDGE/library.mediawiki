Our first project as BRIDGE Nicaragua is the construction of a 18'x30' library and computer center for Morrito Nicaragua which grew out of our first trip.

== Project Details ==
BRIDGE Nicaragua is a group formed by students from San Francisco State University who are working with local Nicaraguan communities in an effort to improve infrastructure and quality of life. We are currently working on a project in the small fishing community of Morrito, Nicaragua.

Morrito is the third [[poorest]] municipality of the second poorest country in the Americas. 34% of the population lives in extreme poverty at less than $1 per day.

Volunteers for BRIDGE Nicaragua first became involved with the town of Morrito after being informed by a local contact of the underdevelopment in the community. In April 2008, local Mayor Eda Medina and Judge Juan Sandino, along with other community leaders, met and decided a new library and computer center was of the highest priority. This would allow for access to information, education, and job skills at the moment inaccessible in Morrito.

In August 2008, a small group of BRIDGE Nicaragua volunteers made our first trip to Morrito in order to meet with the community and make preliminary plans for the project. After raising some funds, we returned in January 2009 and donated laptops, books, and other materials requested by the community. We were also able to finalize details on the library and computer center as well as perform health surveys and hand out health packs to families.

At this point in time we are in dire need of funding for this project as well as future projects we are in the process of planning. If you are interested in donating to our cause or would just like more information about BRIDGE Nicaragua, please leave a message on the talk page.
