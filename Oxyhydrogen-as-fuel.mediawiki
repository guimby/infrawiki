'''Oxyhydrogen can be used as fuel''' in [[internal combustion engine]]s. However, due to the very difficult storability (although production is easy), it must be used rapidly after production. In addition, besides dissapating after a while, it also degrades (reverts to hydrogen) very rapidly (ie after 1 to 2 hours).<ref>Info obtained from Patrick J. Kelly)</ref>. The latter reduces the energetic level by 400%.

With a Bob Boyce electrolyzer (see http://pesn.com/2007/09/29/9500450_BobBoyce_Electrolizer_Plans/d9.pdf ), a gas output is produced which has a much higher energy output than the energy that was needed to split the water in the first place.

[[Oxyhydrogen booster]]s are popularly used in vehicles, mostly in combination with another fuel (ie gasoline) to decrease costs/km in terms of fuel expenses. These are however offcourse not full oxyhydrogen systems. Some full oxyhydrogen systems however have also been built into vehicles.
