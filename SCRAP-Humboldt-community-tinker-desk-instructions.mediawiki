|1| Diagram of the entire Community Tinker Desk in expanded format.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_top_diagram.jpg |
|2| An overview of the table top. Glue and clamp/nail the parts TA1, TA2, and TOP together.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_brace_diagram.jpg |
|3| This is the shear brace for the table. Glue clamp/nail T55 to CBL and position LBA’s on the top side.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_leg_diagram.jpg |
|4| This is the table leg. Glue and nail/clamp T30 to EP1. Glue and nail TC to the center of EP1 and down 3 inches from the top side of EP1. Once TC is mounted, drill corresponding pilot holes for the lag-bolts R12B. Place either homemade or store bought protective pads (P) 2-3 inches in from the ends of EP1.

== Assembly of Bench ==
{{How to
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_bench_diagram.jpg |
|1| Diagram of one of the two identical benches in expanded format.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_bench_top_diagram.jpg |
|2| An overview of the Bench top. Glue and clamp/nail the parts TBA1, TBA2, and BTOP together.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_bench_brace_diagram.jpg |
|3| This is the shear brace for the Bench. Glue clamp/nail TBBC to BBC. Use two LBA’s as used on the table brace.
  | Image:Tinker_Desk_bench_end_diagram.jpg |
|4| This is the bench leg. Glue and nail/clamp TAL to BE. Glue and nail TBCC to the center of BE. Use this diagram for referencing pilot holes for lag-bolts and angle cuts required for both BE and TAL parts. Once TBCC is mounted, drill corresponding pilot holes for the lag-bolts (R38B). Place either homemade or store bought protective pads (P) two inches inward from the ends of BE.

|5| A side view of the bench leg. Notice the triangular shape. Special care should be taken to ensure the proper cutting of materials.
