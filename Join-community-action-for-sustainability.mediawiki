== How to help ==
{{Helpout}}

Community action for sustainability or CASwiki articles are mostly of three kinds:

Place articles, topic articles or resource articles

=== CASwiki place articles ===

Place articles are by far the most numerous kind on CASwiki, reflecting our focus on community action and [[localism]]. They follow a roughly standard format and include details of sustainability initiatives, groups or projects, initiatives by topic, resources, events, news and further links. 

To find out more please see our [[CASwiki places]] portal

=== CASwiki topic articles ===
 
These generally provide a list of actions or project ideas which communties can take or develop, and links to Resources. The articles might also include news and comment, or timeline sections. They include information about topics from a global or generic perspective which can provide a context for more localised information within the place based articles. 

To find out more please see our [[CASwiki topics]] portal
