'''Biogasoline'''  are [[biohydrocarbon]]s with between 5 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule, mainly  [[hexane]].

These biogasolines can be used in pure state (100% biogasoline or BG100) in any conventional [[gasoline engine]] (as happens with [[biobutanol]]), and can be distributed in the same fueling infrastructure, as the properties match traditional gasoline from petroleum.<ref name=CNET20080114>[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9849832-54.html New energy act to fuel flow of 'biogasoline']</ref>  Heptanone is not really biogasoline and requires a small percentage of octane booster to match gasoline. [[Ethanol fuel]] ([[E85]]) requires a special engine and has lower [[combustion energy]] and corresponding [[fuel economy]].  <ref>[http://www.bgtbiogasoline.com/ BGT biogasoline]</ref>

Biogasoline is different from [[biobutanol]] and [[Ethanol]], as they are [[bioalcohol]]s and not bio-hydrocarbons.
