'''Insect pollinators''' refers to the insects that have a primary role of pollinating the more than two-thirds of the world's plant species that require pollination for fertilisation.

== List of insect pollinators ==

The following list details the key insect pollinators:

*Bees
*Wasps
*Flies
*Butterflies
*Some beetles.

In addition to insects, there are certain birds, bats, small mammals and even people on occasion, who have a role in assisting pollination.

Bees are responsible for the majority of pollinating in gardens, of crops and in all relevant natural settings.

Different flowers, crops and natural areas attract different kinds of bees. 

*Australian native bees (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_native_bees)
*Bumblebees (''Bombus'' spp.)
*European honey bees (''Apis mellifera'')
*Leafcutter bees (''Megachile'' spp.)
*Long-horned bees
*Squash bees
*Sweat bees
