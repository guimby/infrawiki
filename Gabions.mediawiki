A '''gabion''' is a [[cage]], [[cylinder]], or box filled with rocks, concrete, or sometimes sand and soil for use in civil engineering, road building, and [[landscaping]]. For erosion control, caged [[riprap]] is used. For dams or in foundation construction, cylindrical metal structures are used. Gabions originated in medieval siegeworks. Leonardo da Vinci designed a type of gabion for the foundations of the San Marco Castle in [[Milan]].<ref>[http://gabiondesign.be/gabion.html]</ref>

==Civil engineering==
The most common civil engineering use of gabions was refined and [[patent]]ed by Gaetano Maccaferri in the late 1800s in Sacerno, Emilia Romagna and used to stabilize [[shore]]lines, stream banks or slopes against [[erosion]]. Other uses include retaining walls, temporary [[flood wall]]s, [[silt]] filtration from runoff, for small or temporary/permanent dams, river training, or channel lining.<ref name="Paving Expert" >{{cite web

Gabions are also used as [[fish screen]]s on small [[stream]]s. Gabion stepped weirs are commonly used for river training and flood control; the stepped design enhances the rate of energy dissipation in the channel, and it is particularly well-suited to the construction of gabion stepped weirs.<ref name="Wuthrich_Chanson2014">{{cite journal|author=Wuthrich, D. and [[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]]  |title= Hydraulics, Air Entrainment and Energy Dissipation on Gabion Stepped Weir |url= http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:337198  |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE |volume=140 |issue=9 |pages= Paper 04014046, 10 pages |doi= 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000919 |issn= 0733-9429 |year=2014 }}</ref>

A gabion wall is a [[retaining wall]] made of stacked stone-filled gabions tied together with wire. Gabion walls are usually [[Batter (walls)|''battered'']] (angled back towards the slope), or stepped back with the slope, rather than stacked vertically.

Gabion baskets have some advantages over loose riprap because of their modularity and ability to be stacked in various shapes; they are also resistant to being washed away by moving water. Gabions also have advantages over more rigid structures, because they can conform to [[subsidence]], dissipate [[energy]] from flowing water, and drain freely. Their strength and effectiveness may increase with time in some cases, as silt and [[vegetation]] fill the interstitial voids and reinforce the structure. They are sometimes used to prevent falling stones from a [[Cut (earthmoving)|cut]] or cliff endangering traffic on a thoroughfare.

[[Image:Gabion 040.jpg|thumb|left|Bridge abutment with gabions]] The life expectancy of gabions depends on the lifespan of the wire, not on the contents of the basket. The structure will fail when the wire fails. Galvanized steel wire is most common, but [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]-coated and stainless steel wire are also used. PVC-coated galvanized gabions have been estimated to survive for 60 years.<ref>[http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311001454/http://www.maccaferri-northamerica.com/files/USA028_FallsRoadMD.pdf |date=March 11, 2012 }}</ref> Some gabion manufacturers guarantee a structural consistency of 50 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gabions.net/featured_projects_2.html|title=Feature Projects - Project 2|work=gabions.net|accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref>

In the United States, gabion use within streams first began with projects completed from 1957 to 1965 on North River, Virginia and Zealand River, New Hampshire.<ref>Toblaski, R.A., and N.K. Tripp, 1961. ''Gabions for stream and erosion control.'' Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 16: 284-285.</ref> More than 150 grade-control structures, bank revetments and channel deflectors were constructed on the two U.S. Forest Service sites. Eventually, a large portion of the in-stream structures failed due to undermining and lack of structural integrity of the baskets. In particular, corrosion and abrasion of wires by bedload movement compromised the structures, which then sagged and collapsed into the channels. Other gabions were toppled into channels as trees grew and enlarged on top of gabion revetments, leveraging them toward the river channels.

Gabions have also been used in building, as in the Dominus Winery in the [[Napa Valley]], [[California]] by architects Herzog & de Meuron, constructed between 1995 and 1997. The exterior is formed by modular wire mesh gabions containing locally quarried stone; this construction allows air movement through the building and creates an environment of moderate temperatures inside.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.floornature.com/projects-commerce/project-herzog-de-meuron-dominus-winery-california-4025/ | title=Dominus Winery in Napa Valley, California, USA. | accessdate=2009-02-22 | publisher=floornature.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Dominus_Winery |title=Dominus Winery |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=Archiplanet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014215250/http://www.archiplanet.org:80/wiki/Dominus_Winery |archivedate=2008-10-14 |df= }}</ref>

==Variations in design==
There are various special designs of gabions to meet particular functional requirements and some special terms for particular forms have come into use. For example:<ref>[http://www.ridgeway-online.com/MM/assets/CPD/GabionCPD.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>
* Bastion: a gabion lined internally with a membrane, typically of nonwoven [[geotextile]] to permit use of a granular soil fill, instead of rock.
* Mattress: a form of gabion with relatively small height relative to the lateral dimensions; commonly very wide. For protecting surfaces from wave erosion and similar attack, rather than building or supporting high structures.<ref>[http://foraas.no/wp.../4.Gabion_-_Spesifikasjoner_og_guide_-_030209.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}</ref>
* Trapion: a form of gabion with a [[trapezoid]]al cross section, designed for stacking to give a face that is sloping rather than stepped. The term is in wide usage, but in contexts related to gabions at least, appears to be a trademark registered by Betafence Limited.
