The Michigan Tech in Open Sustainability Technology research group makes its best effort to [[open source]] its [[:Category:MOST_literature_reviews| literature reviews]] and [[:Category:MOST_methods| protocols]] as the research is taking place and provides direct access to our [[:Category:MOST_methods| research protocols, experimental designs, and equipment]]. In addition, the group publishes in [[open access]] journals as much as possible and posts its pre-prints in open access databases. Normally these pre-prints/final drafts are released under [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ CC-BY-SA] as soon as we are able.
