'''Printed circuit boards''' can be produced by a laser printer, and can even be made with carbon-based compounds.<ref>I.e. organic compounds{{w|Organic compound}} in the chemistry sense of carbon-based - not to be confused with "[[organic farming]]."</ref>

They are not yet competitive in cost and functionality with mass-produced circuit boards, but they offer hope that computers can be produced without mining, and in particular without [[conflict minerals]]{{w|Conflict minerals}} such as [[tantalum]].{{w|tantalum}}
