A '''hydrogen station''' is a storage or [[filling station]] for [[hydrogen]], usually located along a road or [[hydrogen highway]], or at [[home]] as part of the [[distributed generation]] resources concept.<ref>[http://www.i4u.com/32883/horizon-unveils-worlds-first-personal-hydrogen-station-hydrofill-ces-2010 Personal hydrogen station]</ref> The stations are usually intended to power vehicles, but can also be used to power small devices.<ref>[http://green.autoblog.com/2010/01/05/hydrofills-personal-hydrogen-station-to-be-unveiled-at-ces/ Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies HydroFILL intended for the powering of small devices]</ref> Vehicles use hydrogen as fuel in one of several ways, including [[fuel cells]] and mixed fuels like [[HCNG]]. The hydrogen [[fuel dispenser]]s dispense the fuel by the kilogram.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25413866/ LA gas station gets hydrogen fuel pump]</ref>

== Hydrogen highway ==
{{Main|Hydrogen highway}}
A [[hydrogen highway]] is a chain of hydrogen-equipped filling stations and other infrastructure along a road or highway.
Italy and Germany are collaborating to build a hydrogen highway between Mantova (Italy) and Munich (Germany).
Italy completed building a hydrogen filling station in Mantova on 21 September 2007 (see [[Zero Regio]]).
