== Background ==
SCRAP Humboldt, a division of SCRAP, is a non-profit organization that works with the community to reuse waste material in ways that are creative and environmentally sustainable. They are currently opening a new workshop "Maker-Space" in the Arcata area that will be used to produce up-cycled art projects for the community. These projects will range from small to very large in physical size, and having a proper place to work on them is critical. The Community Tinker Desk is a perfect solution to this dilemma.

== Objective ==
Our team's objective was to create the most appealing workbench possible with limited funds. The desk is currently being used to create art projects from up-cycled materials, which can easily be found at SCRAP Humboldt. The desk must be sturdy and include a large work surface to accommodate various art projects. The inclusion of up-cycled materials in the base design of the desk was mandatory for this assignment.

== Description of final project ==
The Tinker Desk is an up-cycled desk and workbench that is designed to be used as a workspace for up to six users simultaneously, while maintaining a low-cost model that is easy to reproduce. The desk is held by two vertical legs that are braced by a central piece, ensuring that the base is sturdy, while also maintaining ample room for leg movement. The benches are designed to be roll-resistant, while the stabilizing brace ensures the desk is stable for moderate-to-heavy use. Every surface of the desk has been sanded to promote splintering-free edges and prevent fabrics and other materials from getting caught and splintering the wood. The legs of the table and benches also have fitted rubber feet to sit on. This will prevent wear on the feet of the workbench and reduce scratching on the floor of the workspace. The design is handicap accessible and was measured to a height that would fit directly underneath the windowsills of the room of its intended use.

==Update October 2014==
The Tinker Desk is still in the SCRAP Humboldt. According to interview with the staffs, it is used during workshops to accommodate various projects. It is possible to see some marks on the surface due the works and workshops given for the community, but the tinker desk is in great condition and fulfilling its purpose. One important observation is that the project is very heavy and it is difficult to move.

==Update October 2016==
The Tinker Desk is no longer in the hands of [[SCRAP Humboldt]]. The new owner of the desk is Cali Cubes which Ali Lee owns. The desk continues to thrive and be used for its purpose. There are minor dents and scratches but other than that its in good condition. There is one update worth mentioning; the desk has small felt pads at the bottom of the desk in order to slide it on wood floor much easier and to not damage it either. Needless to say that the tinker desk is alive and well.
