#Tips
##Having an fan on the print improves print quality
##Heated bed is not necessary
##Extra glue is needed for proper bed adhesion
##Filament tends to fall out of extruder as the print temp is reached, so extrude some(in Franklin works) before printing.
##Having high extrusion for the first 1-2 layers improves bed adhesion
##Increasing skirt length to 2-3 circles is beneficial for bed adhesion and a good first layer
