The manufacturers of many appliances, electronics, and vehicles have taken measures in recent years to force consumers to come to them for repairs or replacements instead of third-party repairers. Many agricultural vehicles now have microchips which force farmers to pay for a manufacturer-authorized mechanic to come inspect the vehicle when repairs are required. Legal mechanisms may also be used in some jurisdictions. Many consumers oppose these measures and promote the '''right for consumers to repair independent of manufacturers'''.
