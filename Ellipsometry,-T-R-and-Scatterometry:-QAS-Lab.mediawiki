= Introduction = 

Ellipsometry is a powerful technique whereby the change in the polarization of light reflecting off a surface is analyzed to determine the optical and dielectric properties of a thin film. This analysis can yield information about layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the probing light itself, even down to a single atomic layer. Ellipsometry can probe the complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor, which gives access to fundamental physical parameters and is related to a variety of sample properties including thichkness, morphology, crystal quality, chemical composition, or electrical conductivity. 

Unlike single-wavelength (laser) ellipsometry which uses a monochromatic light beam, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. SE in these regions studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties such as band-to-band transitions or excitons. - [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsometry Wikipedia]

= Equipment Information = 

The ellipsometer used is a [http://www.jawoollam.com/ J.A. Woollam Co.], Inc vertical-variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (V-VASE). The HS-190 monochromator is a Czerny-Turner Scanning Monochromator with a focal length of 160mm. A VB-400 Controle Module contains the power supply and motor drivers. An AutoRetarder is installed but its use is optional for each test. This device improves the analyzer's accuracy by changing the light entering the detector unit from linearly to circularly polarized.

Turning On (after turning on, wait 20 min before use to allow lamp to warm up)

*	Turn on control box first – In Hardware window, click Initialize to sync the computer to the ellipsometer (software key must be in computer to run WVASE32 program)
*	Press Light button on monochromator followed by Ignite to turn the light on
*	Check to make sure appropriate fibre optic cable is attached – depends on light range/size of beam 
:*	UV: 200nm - 2100nm (dead range from 1350nm – 1450nm due to water absorption)
:*	IR: 270nm – 2300nm


Turning Off

*	Press Light button on monochromator to turn off light, press Light again but not Ignite to leave it off but powered
*	If turning entire system off, turn off light, then monochromator, then control module and vacuum


Calibration (to make sure zero is known for the polarizer and analyzer - should be performed at start of every new testing session)

*	Insert silicon calibration wafer (apply directly from spider case)
*	Click on Align Sample – Calibrate System (default settings are OK)
*	Calibration completed once "acquiring calibration data" progress reaches 100% 
*	Click on File – View Log to compare Ps, As values to previous calibrations


Applying Sample

*	Ensure vacuum box is switched on
*	Switch to appropriate vacuum port as labelled on the back. Slits and holes are used for large and small samples respectively
*	Flip switch on ellipsometer from ‘vent’ to ‘vacuum’
*	Use tweezers (pinch tight) through the sample stage groove to apply sample over the vacuum openings


Aligning Sample (performed for every newly placed sample)

*	In Hardware window, click Acquire Data – Alignment
*	Carefully insert alignment detector
*	Align red cross in centre of the four grey boxes on screen by adjusting alignment knobs (two black knobs on back of sample stage) – cross will move around naturally but want it to be close to centre (X and Y values  <1 ideally) – press Esc to exit once completed
:*	If alignment detector is way off (no or very small grey boxes) one must find the beam manually to get rough sample alignment first 
*	Remove alignment detector

= Acquiring Data - Scatterometry Analysis for anisotropic samples =
----

Scatterometry reveals useful information about interaction of light with anisotropic thin films. If samples are optically anisotropic, the angle of incident light and where on the sample the light arrives at matters.

For isotropic samples reflection occurs according to the Snell's law which means the angle of incident equals the angle of reflection. Therefore, when the ellipsometer is in T/R mode, the detector automatically moves to the position that follows Snell's law. In the case of scatterometry in V-VASE, The detector can be moved azimuthally around the sample stage. This is useful for anisotropic samples that might not follow Snell's law and have reflection/transmission occurs in other angles. By moving the detector azimuthally around, those reflected beams can be detected. For different microstructure different scattering at different angles can happen, therefore, the ideal way is that the detector scan 180 degrees in the plane of incidence. However, since V-VASE is not designed primarily for scatterometry, there are some limitations so that the detector cannot scan 180 degrees in the plane of incidence in azimuthally (reflection mode).

The Figure shows schematically the top view from the position of the detector and the incident beam. The closest the detector and the incident beam can reach is at 30 degrees. Thus, the  detector can only scan reflected  light for  (θ<sub>i</sub> -30<sup>o</sup>)+ 90<sup>o</sup>  degrees azimuthally. The detector is able to measure specular peaks as well as non-specular peaks within this range (shown as red curve in the Figure). However, any scattering that happens (90<sup>o</sup> - θ<sub>i</sub>)+30<sup>o</sup> from the side that detector can't cover, will be  missed in the acquired data. For high incident angles a wider range can be scanned by the detector.  For example, if the angle of incident is 70<sup>o</sup>, the  detector can scan (70<sup>o</sup>-30<sup>o</sup>)+90<sup>o</sup>=130<sup>o</sup> degrees and start scanning clockwise away from the incident light. For incident angle of 15 degrees the detector can only moves 75<sup>o</sup> away from the light source.

Because of this limitation, for different incident angles, one has to set the movement of the detector independently.

:*Check  Dynamic Averaging Enabled . "The Dynamic averaging lets WVASE determine the number of analyzer cycles to average by averaging the data until the standard deviation of the noise on the averaged data  falls below some cutoff level".  
:*Set the maximum number of revolution to 2000. 
*The large number of Max # of Rev will make the experiment time consuming but the data obtained are less noisier. This is useful for observing non-specular peaks that might not be as strong as specular peaks.
