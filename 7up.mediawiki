== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* basic measurement

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Print the top part and down part separately.
# Joint them by heater through the edge of each part.
# printing time for each part is about 1.5 hours.
# Jointing time is about 15 min. 


=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Carefully when using the heater, don't burn yourself :)

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Estimate your costs: about 2 dollar.
# Find a commercial equivalent: about 10 dollar because of the material. 
# 8$ savings and 80% savings
