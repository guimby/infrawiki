[[image:hardwarex.gif]] ''[http://www.journals.elsevier.com/hardwarex HardwareX]'' is an [[open access]] journal established to promote [[free and open source]] designing, building and customizing of scientific infrastructure (hardware). ''HardwareX'' aims to recognize researchers for the time and effort in developing scientific infrastructure while providing end-users with sufficient information to replicate and validate the advances presented. HardwareX is open to input from all scientific, technological and medical disciplines. Scientific infrastructure will be interpreted in the broadest sense. Including hardware modifications to existing infrastructure, sensors and tools that perform measurements and other functions outside of the traditional lab setting (such as wearables, air/water quality sensors, and low cost alternatives to existing tools), and the creation wholly new tools for either standard or novel laboratory tasks. Authors are encouraged to submit hardware developments that address all aspects of science, not only the final measurement, for example, enhancements in sample preparation and handling, user safety, and quality control. The use of distributed digital manufacturing strategies (e.g. 3-D printing) are encouraged. All designs must be submitted under an [[open hardware]] license.
