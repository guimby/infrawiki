* 80-90 - publishable with <1 day of work - no major errors - all documentation turned in on time 
* 70-80 - publishable with <1/2 week of work - major revisions required, most documentation provided
* 60-70 - not publishable because of major errors, but some salvageable progress to be passed on to future students. Documentation mostly correct and complete.
* <60 - Not publishable. Documentation lacking of limited or no use to others.
