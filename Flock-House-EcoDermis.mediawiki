==Abstract==
[http://www.flockhouse.org/ Flock House], the client, contacted [http://www.humboldt.edu Humboldt State University] to build various parts of a new alternative living structure in New York City. Team EcoDermis was formed in order to create a solution for a weatherproof shell as well as coverings for the openings of the the structure. Multiple alternative solutions were formed through group brainstorming. These alternatives were put through a process to determine which solution best fulfilled the criteria. Discussion with the client led to a decision of a combination of two alternatives. The Bird Cage forms the main weatherproofing shell while the Plastic Plumage covers the window openings.

==Background==
[[File:flock house.gif|frame|none|50px|The Client]]

The Flock House project is a concept to provide a new form of housing for different migrating populations throughout the world. These structures demonstrate an inspirational method to use repurposed materials to construct everything needed to function in a modern society. It shows a new way to come together as a community and work together to help the individual and the community. The Flock House will inspire community-interdependence and resourcefulness. [http://www.marymattingly.com/| Mary Mattingly] is the voice of the client that we worked with on the project. Mary and other professionals, engineers, builders, teachers, designers, and architects built a similar sustainable living environment called the [http://www.thewaterpod.org/ Waterpod Project]. This is a floating barge that moved around the boroughs of New York to show a sustainable living culture. The Flock House is a mobile structure for land that will be able to link up with other Flock Houses. Each Flock House will have a skin/shell to protect it from the elements as well as alternative energy sources, bike power charging stations, a solar dehydrator, and a power meter to display the power used and stored.

== Problem Statement & Criteria ==

=== Problem Statement ===
The Flock House needs to be covered with a skin or shell that meets the criteria listed below. The Flock House will be inhabited by 2 artists and the skin needs to have the main function of protecting the occupants from the elements outside and providing them with privacy.

=== Objective ===

Flock House needs a waterproof skin made from material that is inexpensive, sourced from reused materials, able to be produced by someone with moderate technical skill, and suited for a variety of weather conditions.

=== Criteria ===
The criteria for the skin of the Flock House was created from a problem analysis and through communication with the client. Each criteria is weighted with its designated importance. The scale is from 1-10 with 10 being the most important.

==Description of final project==
The final project decision is a combination of The Plastic Plumage to cover the windows and The Bird Cage for the outer shell. 

===Plastic Plumage===
Plastic Plumage is a way of using empty one gallon milk cartons in a new way to cover the windows on the Flock House. The layering of each string of plastic shingles allows for a fluttering effect when wind is present. These shingles provide a moderate amount of water protection while still allowing light and fresh air in.

===Bird Cage===
The bird cage is a spiral hemisphere made out of recycled corrugated plastic. Each piece is overlapped by at least two inches on the bottom and wraps around itself in a layering style that is very visually appealing and so attracts attention to the Flock House.

== Cost and Materials ==
=== Design Cost ===
Design cost is measured in hours. The total hours spent on the creation of the skin for the Flock House are 352 with the total being broken into respective segments as shown in the pie chart below.

=== Implementation Cost ===
The implementation cost is what it cost Team Ecodermis to construct the Plastic Plumage/Bird cage Combo and what a retail cost would be.

== Data/Results ==
Placing a tub inside the structure allows us to measure how much water can seep through. Putting newspaper throughout the tub allows for detection of water leakage. Using a water hose and a spray nozzle we showered the Bird Cage for 30 minutes. The results were that the edges of the structure got wet from water running down the sides of the corrugated plastic and collecting in a ring on the outside. This would be a good area for the Flock House to make a water collection system most efficient.

To get a true wind test result, we took our structure to an open field to allow for as much unobstructed wind as possible. According to our altimeter the wind varied between 6 and 15 MPH. Due to the lightness of the structure, we used 100lb to weigh it down to see how the panels held up under the wind force. The wind produces enough force on the panels to cause tearing around the bolts. A rubber grommet should be added where the bolts pin the bottoms of the plastic together.

How to Build Your Own!!

=== Step by Step Process ===

{{How to
|title= Plastic Plumage
|size= 180
|Image:Shingle Outline.JPG|
|1 |Draw the desired shape onto your container. Depending on the shape of your container you can get up to 3 shingles per container.
|Image:Shingle Shape.JPG|
|2 |Cut the shingle out with either scissors or a box cutter. Once you have multiple shingles created you can layer them together to punch holes in them. Using a 16 penny nail and a hammer, hammer two holes all the way through each shingle.
|Image:String of shingles.JPG | 
|3 |String your wire through the holes of each shingle while making sure to overlap each of the next shingles.
|Image:Wire Crimp.JPG|
|4 |Eye loop bolts are drilled into the PVC frame to allow for at least 2 inch overlap over the previous string of shingles. String the wire through the eye loop bolts and crimp off at each end. Make sure to get the wire as taut as possible before crimping.
|Image:Plastic Plumage.jpeg|
|5 |Continue connecting your wire with shingles until you have covered the opening. Starting your rows of shingles at the bottom and over lapping about 2 inches allows the best effect for air flow and water protection.

{{How to
|title= Bird Cage
|size= 180
|Image:Bird Cage Panels.jpg|
|1 |Pinning the bottom of the corrugated plastic with little pieces of wood allows you to bend the sheets of plastic and find the best placement for the hole in the sheet over the metal rod at the top of the structure. 
|Image:Top Bolt.jpg|
|2 |Drilling up through the PVC supports of the structure creates a hole for the pivot bolt to go through. We used a 4"x1/4" eye bolt for this purpose. Since the Flock House is a fiber glass shell we recommend using an appropriate size screw bolt or in the forming of the fiber glass a metal rod can be molded into the structure. The smaller the diameter of the rod the better as to not allow water seepage. 
|Image:Bird Cage Folding.jpg| 
|3 |Bend each sheet over the next to find best coverage. Determine where the hole for the rod will be and drill a hole for each sheet. Layer one over the other until you cant attach the washer and nut over the corrugated plastic. 
|Image:Bird Cage Bottom.JPG|
|4 |After the top of each sheet is attached, take off the pieces of wood holding them on and replace with a 2"x1/4" eye bolt. These will hold the pieces of corrugated plastic together at the bottom. For the Flock House itself the idea is to place a runner along the inside of the wooden truss system that the bottom of the sheets could lock into. 
|Image:Door Hatch Closed.jpg|
|5 |The door has to close like a hatch since the over lapping closes off. We attached a handle to the door and three hooks on the bottom of the sheet to allow for the door to hook shut from the inside or outside.
|Image:Vanduzin arcata 228.jpg|
|6 |Since all the pieces of the corrugated plastic can hinge around the middle rod you can pivot them around to stack on top of each other to allow air inside the structure. Seal each edge of the corrugated plastic with weather stripping. Find a weather strip with a peel of sticky backing. This will seal tightly to the plastic. If the weatherstripping is a foam like substance use beeswax to line the edge to help water run off and way from the seams.
