The '''Lightweight Linux Network''' (LLN) is an informal network of groups and individuals who use and/or develop usable Linux and Linux tools that are light in their use of computing resources. We share ideas and stay in sync using a [http://groups.google.com/group/lightweight-linux mailing list], an [http://identi.ca/group/lightlinux Identi.ca group], and through these wiki pages.

Linux distros and components with an emphasis on streamlined coding - such as Openbox, LXDE, XFCE, Slitaz, Puppy, Debian and many more - have much in common. This network is intended to make it easier to send out a message - a suggestion or question - to the wider community of people who know, love, use and create lightweight Linux tools. 

== Why it matters ==

* Faster operation
* Lower hardware requirements - smaller CPU and less RAM can do the job.
* An old computer will continue to be useful for longer - very important in [[ICT for development]] (ICT4D)
* Less heat produced
* Less use of [[electricity]]
* Longer battery life
* [[Lean code]] is potentially more elegant, more stable, and easier to debug

These lead to three key outcomes:
* '''A lower carbon footprint''' (through lower energy use and less frequent computer hardware upgrades)
* '''More usable laptops and handheld devices''' (thanks to lower hardware requirements, less heat output and longer batter life)
* '''Better results in ICT for development''' (thanks to lower hardware requirements, and lower power needs) 

== Guidelines ==

* Be civil.
* Go further than being civil: Be constructive. We don't have to all agree. We can talk about pros and cons, but this is not a place for accusations or name-calling.
* We want to promote the development of lightweight [[Linux]] which is usable for everyone. Not everyone has to like the same solutions. GUIs are important, but command line tools are important too - after all, GUIs use these commands too (they just add a handy interface on top).
* We don't want to create a bunch of separate web sites (including forums blogs and wikis) to divide our attention further. We'll use existing web sites where possible (e.g. find a home on an existing Linux forum site).

== Where to find the Lightweight Linux Network ==

* [http://identi.ca/group/lightlinux On Identi.ca]
* [http://groups.google.com/group/lightweight-linux On Google Groups]

Perhaps we could start a subforum on a Linux forum, but a better idea is probably to use a common tag: '''lightlinux'''. If you absolutely must, use lightgnulinux, but that reduces visibility a bit. (If adding a link on this page to search-by-tag or search-by-keyword result in forums etc, use a search for lightlinux OR lightgnulinux where possible.)


''These are the guidelines and network proposed by [[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] 10:18, 21 September 2009 (UTC) & 03:36, 16 December 2009 (UTC). Feel free to tweak them or add more in the same general spirit. If you want to make major changes, suggest them on the {{talk page}}.''

== Lightweight Linux software ==

See [[Lightweight Linux software]] for some suggested conclusions as to the best packages to use.
