== Problem ==
"It is estimated that three-quarters of the world’s AIDS population lives in Sub-Saharan Africa; most have no access to lifesaving drugs, testing facilities or even basic preventative health care.One of the major factors inhibiting medical professionals in Africa from treating this disease is the inability to access vast areas of the continent with adequately equipped medical facilities." <ref>http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/programs/africa/africa.html </ref>

== Summary ==
"[[Architecture for Humanity]] (an Appropedia partner) challenged the world’s architects and health care professionals to submit designs for a mobile [[HIV]]/AIDS health clinic. Designers were given six months to develop schemes for a fully equipped, mobile medical unit and [[HIV]]/AIDS treatment center that could not only be used for testing, prevention and treatment of the disease but also for disseminating information regarding the virus and providing basic health care services. In submitting designs, entrants were asked to consider a number of criteria; chief among them, ease of deployment and maintenance by a small team of medical professionals, community acceptance and cost." <ref>http://www.architectureforhumanity.org/programs/africa/overview.html</ref>
