'''Potential difference''' is defined as the [[work]] that must be performed to move a [[charge]] from one point to another.  For example there must be a potential difference in a [[current]] for a charge to move between two points.  It is also described as the [[potential energy]] difference per unit charge or voltage.  The unit of potential difference is the [[Volt]] (V).
