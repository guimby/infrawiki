As a scientific endeavor in applied sustainability this project will address currently open questions and develop well supported answers in the limits of process intensification of lactic acid production and whether the process can be suitable adapted to lignocellulose feedstock. The project can broken into the three major steps of lactic acid fermentation, lactic acid purification, and polylactic acid polymerization all which are under intensive study and have numerous areas that could be improved.
