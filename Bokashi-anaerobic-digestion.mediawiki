'''Bokashi anaerobic digestion''' is a method of [[anaerobic digestion]] to prepare almost ANY kitchen waste (incl. carnivorous waste) for composting (incl. directly into the earth).  This makes it a very interesting candidate for handling food waste quickly and efficiently from urban sites, institutions, and other places where compost bins would be inconvenient or would otherwise attract pests.  It is also a net carbon sink, since the method produces almost no greenhouse gases and can be scaled (municipally) to sequester large amounts of carbon.  Variants of the bokashi method also show promise in bio-remediation. 

==How to Make Bokashi fertiliser==
* Commercial method: Suppliers can provide either finished dried bokashi in ziplock bags or a solution of a dozen species of sleeping Micro-organisms that can be activated and extended in any kitchen, using clean water, molasses and a source of carbon such as wheat bran, rice hulls, coffee grounds or maybe even shredded newspaper   
* 100% Homemade method:  replace the solution of micro-organisms with Whey (currently being experimented in several places) [http://bokashislope.blogspot.com/2008/09/hole-in-ground-your-money-goes-in.html] [http://www.wildlifegardeners.org/forum/fertilizing-soil-amendments/1292-extreme-bokashi-make-your-own-innoculant.html] [http://bokashicomposting.com/?page_id=53]
* Garbage Enzyme: a popular variant in parts of Asia [http://www.o3enzyme.com/] [http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/20040401/Hamilton] which can also be produced 100% homemade
