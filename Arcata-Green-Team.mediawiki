The Arcata Green Team is comprised of students in the [[Engr370 Energy, Technology and Society]] class at [[Humboldt State University]]. The goal of the first ever Green Team was to provide the City of Arcata with informational/inspirational videos and webpages on home energy use and retrofits. The Spring 2011 Arcata Green Team focused on energy retrofits, for renters, that pay themselves back during the time of a one year lease.  The Arcata Green Team is very proud to present the pages below and the Phantom Menace video.
