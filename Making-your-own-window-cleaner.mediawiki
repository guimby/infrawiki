Dirty windows make it hard to appreciate the wonderful world outside. Fortunately, there are various ways to make your own window cleaner to fix this problem in a jiffy (just add elbow grease!).

You might be curious as to why vinegar features in so many window cleaner recipes––basically, it's because it works to cut through grime, restore the clarity of the glass and reduces streaks. The other additions provide different assistance, so it can be a good idea to try different ones to see which work the best for you.

Feel free to add more examples of effective, eco-friendly window cleaners.

== White vinegar window cleaner ==

# Prepare a bucket of window cleaner. This should be enough to clean several large windows.
# Set down a bucket. Pour in equal parts white vinegar and water.
# Tear off sheets of newspaper. Crumple into small balls.
# Dip the crumpled balls into the vinegar solution. Allow the ball to soak up the liquid, then pull out of the bucket and squeeze to remove excess liquid.
# Rub the wet newspaper on the window. Go around in circular cleaning motions. The grime will start to come off the window. Keep moving to different parts of the window, replacing the wet newspaper balls as the last one falls to pieces.
# Finish by wiping the windows dry with a dry, clean piece of newspaper.

== Vinegar and alcohol window cleaner ==

# Use a spray bottle for making the cleaner and for spraying. It's a good idea to label the bottle so that you know what's in it and it can be reused many times for the same window cleaning solution.
# Pour in one cup of water, one cup of rubbing alcohol and one tablespoon of white vinegar. Screw the lid on. Shake to combine.
#*You may find it helpful to use a funnel to pour the ingredients into the spray bottle.
# To use, spray on the window. Use a newspaper or cleaning cloth to wipe the window clean, using circular motions.
# Dry by wiping over with a dry, clean piece of newspaper.

== Vinegar and dish detergent window cleaner ==

This solution is good for the external side of windows.

# Pour 2 cups of water, a 1/4 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 teaspoon of dish detergent into a small bucket or other container. Stir to combine.
# Use a scrubbing brush to wash the window. Dip into the window cleaner, then scrub the window. 
# Rinse off with clean, cold water. Rinse off the cleaner completely. The windows can be left to air dry if used externally.


== Vinegar and cornstarch window cleaner ==

# Use a spray bottle for making the cleaner and for spraying. It's a good idea to label the bottle so that you know what's in it and it can be reused many times for the same window cleaning solution.
# Pour the following ingredients into the bottle: 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/4 cup rubbing alcohol, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 2 cups of lukewarm water. Stir or shake to combine all of the ingredients and to dissolve the cornstarch.
# Use by spraying squirts onto the dirty windows. Rub with wet newspaper or a damp cleaning cloth, using circular motions.
# Dry by rubbing over with dry, clean newspaper sheets.
