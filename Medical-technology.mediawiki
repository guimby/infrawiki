'''Medical technology''' is critical for saving lives and preserving [[health]] and [[quality of life]] in cases of illness and injury. 

However, often this technology is unavailable or unaffordable for those who need it, especially in [[less economically developed countries]]. [[Appropriate technology]] for health is important in filling this need.
