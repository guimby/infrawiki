[http://www.lyx.org/ LyX] is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the ''structure'' of your documents ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM WYSIWYM]) and not simply their appearance ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG WYSIWYG]).

LyX combines the power and flexibility of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX TeX]/[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX LaTeX] with the ease of use of a graphical interface.
