==Problem being addressed==
Respiratory failure accounts for about 4.9 million infant deaths a year in developing countries.  CPAP devices are successful in treatment but can be too expensive to be used commonly in low-resource facilities. 

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Breath of Life CPAP device is much cheaper (~$1000) compared to other devices that range from $4-10,000. The flows air or oxygen into airway interfaces to maintain a safe pressure in the lungs, preventing respiratory distress. The device is easy to use as health care workers only need to attach nasal prongs to the childâ€™s nostrils in order to provide air flow.
