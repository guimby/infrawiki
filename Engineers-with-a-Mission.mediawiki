==Introduction==
Engineers with a Mission (EM) is a Christian organization created to educate engineering students about [[appropriate technology]] and give them hands on learning experience at school and abroad. EM's method for doing this is through annual projects and informational meetings and activities. Throughout the school year, members learn the engineering needs of developing communities around the world and how to appropriately meet those needs. They apply what they learn through various appropriate technology oriented projects that are worked on with professors and graduate students. During summer vacation, small teams of students travel to developing countries around the world for an extended period of 2-10 weeks. There, they get to implement a project while also having the opportunity to develop relationships and broaden their view of the world. 

Their charter chapter is at Baylor University and was formed in 2004.

The Baylor chapter maintains a website at http://www3.baylor.edu/EngineerswithaMission.
