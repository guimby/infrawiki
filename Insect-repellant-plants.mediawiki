'''Disease-repelling plants''' are plants can be used to repel insects (that may or may not act as host to diseases) and/or microbes. 

These may have some effect in reducing discomfort from annoying insects, and will possibly have a positive health impact and risk reduction. However they must never be considered as replacements for proven techniques such as [[bednets]], [[DEET]] insect-repellant, and [[mosquito control]] practices.

The plants can be spread in rooms using electric vaporisers or [[Bronchial kettle|flame-based vaporisers]]<ref>[http://tv.sky.com/victorian-pharmacy Bronchial kettle]</ref> or dry herb heaters<ref>[http://www.eoco.org.uk/acatalog/BURNERS_.html Dry herb heaters (flame-based)]</ref> The substances however need to be spread in each room, ie by placing one unit in each room, or via a HVAC duct.
