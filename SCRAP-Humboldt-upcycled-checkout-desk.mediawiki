''The objective of Team Checkout Us was to build a desk for the [[SCRAP Humboldt]] nonprofit to compliment their new location on H and G Streets in Arcata. The client wanted the desk to inspire customers that enter the shop to start their own creative upcycling projects. The desk needed to be aesthetically pleasing, as well as have plenty of storage and other essential components allowing the cashier to go about daily  business of running the store.''

== Background ==
Team Checkout Us consists of three Humboldt State University students unrolled in the Spring 2012 [[Engr215 Introduction to Design syllabus| ENGR 215 Introduction to Design]] class. The client was [http://scraphumboldt.wordpress.com/ SCRAP Humboldt]; a non-profit whose objective is to remove interesting and useful items from the waste stream for reuse, either in an artistic, or useful fashion. SCRAP Humboldt was in need of an aesthetically pleasing checkout desk in their new location that would compliment their new space, as well as act as an inspiration for others to reuse material in their own creative projects.

== Problem statement and criteria ==

== Description of Final Design ==
[[Image:Final Simp-L.jpg|center|frame|Complete Simp-L checkout desk]]
This is the final desk built by Team Checkout Us. It has two sides with separate purposes for [[SCRAP Humboldt]]. The long side is meant to be used as the cashiering side, where the client will place the cash register and take care of transactions. The short side of the desk is used for the measurement of large bolts of cloth, or paper. The desk also features interior storage in the form of two drawers, one with a lock for the storage of valuables or money. The drawers are featured in the How to Build Section below.

==Testing Results==
The Simp-L checkout desk built for SCRAP Humboldt fit the criteria set for it very well. It was durable enough to stand up to daily use and had the necessary storage needed to store cash and other accoutrements needed for day to day business. It was also aesthetically pleasing enough to hopefully inspire customers to do their own creative reuse projects.

==How to build==
Due to the fact that the desk was made out of found wood, our team had trouble finding large pieces of wood for the desk. So our group had to use creative forms of joining to make larger boards of wood. After constructing our large pieces of wood, we laid out a plan to design the creative reuse panels. Each panel was featuring a different material that could be used for reuse. The panels are featured below in a gallery.

We also added interior storage to desk for valuables and money. We salvaged old drawers from broken dressers, and made a carcass to mount the drawers on to the desk. We also took old counter tops and mounted them on the outside to give [[SCRAP Humboldt]] some outer display areas.
