==Problem being addressed==
Jaundice is a condition characterized by a buildup of yellow pigment, bilibrubin, in the blood. If untreated, jaundice in newborns can cause permanent brain damage. Treatment of jaundice falls short in low-resource settings because while a high number of patients need treatment, there are limited numbers of available phototherapy devices. Quick ways to diagnosis jaundice allow hospitals to rapidly pass patients through treatment, but current bilirubinometers are too expensive to be commonplace in resource-limited areas.

==Detailed description of the solution==
This mobile phone platform will use the camera and simple applications of the phone to accurately detect, with sufficient sensitivity, the levels of bilirubin in the childâ€™s skin. This will quickly detect how jaundiced a newborn is, allowing for subsequent treatment as necessary.
