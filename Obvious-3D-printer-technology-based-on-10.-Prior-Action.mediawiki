Perform, before it is needed, the required change of an object (either fully or partially).
• Pre-pasted wall paper
• Sterilize all instruments needed for a surgical procedure on a sealed tray.

Pre-arrange objects such that they can come into action from the most convenient place and without losing time for their delivery.
• Kanban arrangements in a Just-In-Time factory
• Flexible manufacturing cell

# '''Pancake flipper, where there are multiple print heads that are printing.  Once a layer is finished printing it flips to a central location and the next layer, say clockwise, would be flipped to the central location.  All of the print heads would be constantly printing.  (This would help solve overhang issues, and increase print time).'''[[User:Hjhunt|Hjhunt]] ([[User talk:Hjhunt|talk]]) 07:22, 3 December 2015 (PST)
