==Abstract==
# Paragraph description of the OSAT - why is it Appropriate? What need does it fulfil? Are there case studies you have found of a technology being used successfully?
# Picture of completed print using [[image:name-of-your-image.png|500px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
# Provide a full BOM -- Materials needed for fabrication of device and alternative materials if they are not available, prices/sources of non-printable parts
## Upload and link to all source files
## Upload and link to all STLs

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
#

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* If you used special skill – link to relevant wikipedia or wikiversity articles/courses

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Provide directions for print/assembly - be detailed enough in your “how to” to ensure that someone could construct the device from your description. Consider the elegance of IKEA like instructions.
# Include print time estimate
# Include assembly time estimate
# Including drawings or pictures of the device at stage of assembly at minimum. (http://www.appropedia.org/Special:Upload)
# Consider video if appropriate

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Include common mistakes/problems to avoid in building your OSAT and how to overcome them

== Cost savings==
* If your solution is not a low cost one then it is not really appropriate.
# Estimate your costs
# Find a commercial equivalent
# Calculate $ savings and % savings

==References==

* The sources of information (e.g. engineering handbooks, journal articles, government documents, webpages, books, magazine articles etc.). References should use the <nowiki> <ref> </ref> and <references/>  </nowiki>tags and can be in any format but should include all the information necessary for someone else to find the same information you did. For example: <ref> web page: Department of Energy (DOE) Landscaping and Energy Efficiency, DOE/GO-10095 (1995) Available: http://www.eren.doe.gov/erec/factsheets/landscape.html</ref>

Based on the developmental needs addressed (e.g. food, heat, electricity, clean water, health  care, etc.) be sure to label your device in the proper categories e.g. use [[Category:Water]]. Be sure to categorize your device so that it will be easy to find – for example “Low voltage connection basics” is categorized in 



[[Category:How tos]]
[[Category:Electricity]]
[[Category:Electric lighting]].
