[[File:Compost-System ChickenTractors.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Building on the work of compost connoisseur [http://www.vermontcompost.com/ Karl Hammer] and permaculture educator [http://www.geofflawtononline.com/ Geoff Lawton], we’ll be testing whether a small farm can run a profitable egg enterprise by feeding chickens on local food wastes, producing compost as a by-product. Details of the system are published [http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Compost_Chicken_System on the project page on the OSE Wiki]. ]]

Chickens can be fed on [[vermicompost|worms]], bugs, food waste and forage alone. This can eliminate the need for grain purchases entirely. Please have a look at the approach that [http://www.vermontcompost.com/ Karl Hammer of Vermont Compost] has taken.
