==Introduction==
The boiler unit consumes a significant portion of a building's energy.  Large gains can be made in this area with relatively simple system modifications.  This page will provide information to aid in the audit of a boiler unit.
==General Boiler Information==
There are a number of boiler types, all with advantages and disadvantages.  The most common boiler types are listed below:
*Fire Tube Boiler{{w|Fire-tube boiler}}
*Water Tube Boiler{{w|Water-tube boiler}}
*Cast-Iron Boiler{{w|Boiler}}

Within this general group, there are a number of sub-types, including:

== Burner and Fan System ==
The burner and fan system of the boiler unit provides a means to increase efficiency.  These units can sometimes be modified to include newer, more efficient components, however care must be taken to examine the boiler design to prevent unwanted results (heat transfer characteristics are important here).
Information required:
*Cleaning and Maintenance Schedule
*Type of Burning Unit
*Type of Fan Motors
