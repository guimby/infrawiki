Air pollution is a chemical, particulate matter, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

Worldwide air pollution is responsible for large numbers of deaths and cases of [[respiratory disease]].{{fact}} While major stationary sources such as power plants are often identified with air pollution, the greatest source of emissions is actually mobile sources, mainly automobiles.{{fact}} [[Greenhouse gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]], which contribute to [[global warming]], have recently gained recognition as pollutants and internationally laws are being developed to reduce these emissions.

== Particulates ==
[[Particulates]] are a major cause of respiratory problems - these can be reduced by:
* [[cleaner burning]],
* Post-treatment (e.g. [[catalytic converters]] in vehicles - which require low sulfur fuel), use of [[air filters]]s 
* more efficient [[design]] such that less fuel is needed:
** Less [[heating]] of [[buildings]] through [[passive solar design]], or 
** Less power, through lighter [[vehicles]] with less wind resistance, energy capturing brakes, and [[urban planning]] to reduce traffic congestion.
* Choice of fuel. Diesel is worse than standard petrol (aka gasoline) [[Biofuel]] is generally better than [[fossil fuel]]

== Indoor air pollution ==
[[Indoor air pollution]] is a less visible threat, originating mainly in:
* [[offgassing]] from household products and [[construction materials]] containing synthetic compounds (especially in wealthy communities) and 
* [[indoor fires]] for [[heating]] and [[cooking]], including from [[kerosene fires|kerosene]] and dung (the worst), wood (also bad) and charcoal (less harmful smoke).{{fact}}
