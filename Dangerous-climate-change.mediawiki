There is a high risk of '''dangerous climate change''', especially from the point of view of poor coastal communities such as those in Bangladesh, and communities with tenuous [[food security]].

The predicted temperature and [[carbon dioxide]] levels at which [[climate change]] becomes dangerous are not known precisely, but estimates have been increasing, at the same time as the trajectory of emissions is showing signs of worsening, rather than improving. A temperature rise of 2Â° C is a widely held target discussed at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15){{w|2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference}} in [[Copenhagen]] in 2009; however the targets set by attending nations, even if met, appear unlikely to keep below this threshold.
