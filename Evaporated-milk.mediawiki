This is made from fresh, unpasteurized whole [[milk]]. The process removes 60% of the water; the concentrate is heated, homogenized, and vitamin D is added. It is then canned and heated again to sterilize the contents. It may also have other nutrients and chemical stabilizers added. A mixture of one part water and one part evaporated milk will have about the same nutritional value of an equal amount of fresh milk. There is generally no date or "use by" code on evaporated milk. 

Health and nutrition food stores often carry canned, evaporated [[goat]]'s milk, in a similar concentration. 

Unopened cans of evaporated milk can be stored on a cool, dry shelf for up to six months.
