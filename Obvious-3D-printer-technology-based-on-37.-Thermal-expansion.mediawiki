#Thermal expansion print bed that heats up when print is complete for easier removal of part
#Have an extruder head with different thermal coefficients, so the heat can be radically changed throughout the print for different elements of the part
#Use belts which can contract with thermal expansion to create greater tension
#

#improve resolution (atomic): 
#improve print speed (instantaneous):
#enhance material availability (all):
#reduce parts of the printer (1?):
#reduce costs of printer (free):
#reduce costs of materials (free):
#make it easier to use (McDonald's screen):
#make it easier to assemble (self):
#make it easier to maintain (none, unbreakable, self healing):
#make fully assembled products (anything - computer, car, smartphone, dinner):
#use functional printing materials (e.g. electronics)
#reduce waste (zero):
#use less energy (zero or ambient):
#quieter printing (soundless):
#ubiquitous printing (everywhere):
#print smaller (nanoscale):
#print bigger (apartment complex, Great Wall of China, planet?):
#enable auto calibration:
#enable auto leveling:
#enable auto monitoring:
#enable quality control:
#enable real-time feedback:
#make it safer (infant approved):
#make is smell good (designer imposters?):
#make it from current waste products (CO2, flash, spent fuel rods?):

#Enclose printer so it is surrounded by high temperature air. A certain temperature could melt the layers together after they are done printing to get rid of layer lines and increase resolution[[User:Krcipriano|Krcipriano]] ([[User talk:Krcipriano|talk]]) 07:45, 1 December 2016 (PST)
#Increase temperature of filament so it is almost liquid but print on a cooled bed (colder than room temperature)[[User:Krcipriano|Krcipriano]] ([[User talk:Krcipriano|talk]]) 07:45, 1 December 2016 (PST)
