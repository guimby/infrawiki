*'''What is Available:''' This store is small, and specializes in straw/hay.
*'''Location:''' From Ramon Arizpe, turn right on Reforma Street and go approx. 2-3 blocks down Reforma Street.  Look right at this point because the name of street with store not posted). Immediately look right at the corner, you should clearly see the store on the lefthand side of the street - it operates in conjunction with a veterinary supply store.  You canÂ´t miss this farm store as the storefront is clearly marked exactly as the photo show.
