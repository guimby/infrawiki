'''Plant fats and oils''' are [[lipid]] materials derived from [[plants]]. Physically, [[oil]]s are liquid at [[room temperature]], and [[fat]]s are solid.  Chemically, both fats and oils are composed of [[triglycerides]], as contrasted with [[wax]]es which lack [[glycerin]] in their structure. Although many plant parts may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from [[seed]]s.

Vegetable fats and oils may or may not be edible. Examples of inedible vegetable fats and oils include processed [[linseed oil]], [[tung oil]], and [[castor oil]] used in lubricants, paints, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial applications.

== Cooking oils ==
=== General cooking oils ===
Several oils are used as general cooking oils. Note that each specific cooking oil has a specific heat tolerance (high or low [[smoke point]]). When choosing a cooking oil, it is important to match the oil's heat tolerance with the cooking method; this due to health reasons.

Oils that are suitable for high-temperature frying (above {{convert|230|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) are:
* [[Avocado oil]]
* [[Corn oil]]
* [[Mustard oil]]
* [[Palm oil]]
* [[Peanut oil]] (marketed as "groundnut oil" in the UK and India)
* [[Rice bran oil]]
* [[Safflower oil]]
* [[Sesame oil]] (semi-refined)
* [[Soybean oil]]
* [[Sunflower oil]]

Oils suitable for medium-temperature frying (above {{convert|190|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=s}}) include:{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

* [[Almond oil]]
* [[Cottonseed oil]]
* [[Diacylglycerol (DAG) oil]]
* [[Ghee]], [[Clarified butter]]
* [[Grape seed oil]]
* [[Lard]]
* [[Olive oil]] (Virgin, and refined)
* [[Rapeseed oil]], (marketed [[Canola oil]] in North America or, sometimes, simply "vegetable oil" in the UK)
* [[Mustard oil]]
* [[Walnut oil]]

===Speciality cooking oils: nut oils ===
Nut oils are generally used in cooking, for their [[flavor]]. Most are quite costly, because of the difficulty of extracting the oil.
* [[Almond#Oils|Almond oil]], used as an edible oil, but primarily in the manufacture of [[cosmetics]].
* [[Beech]] nut oil, from ''Fagus sylvatica'' nuts, is a well-regarded edible oil in Europe, used for salads and cooking.

* [[Macadamia oil]], with a mild nutty flavor and a high [[smoke point]].
* [[Mongongo|Mongongo nut]] oil (or ''manketti oil''), from the seeds of the ''Schinziophyton rautanenii'', a tree which grows in [[South Africa]]. High in [[vitamin E]]. Also used in skin care.

===Speciality cooking oils: citrus oils===
A number of [[citrus]] plants yield pressed oils. Some, like lemon and orange oil, are used as [[essential oil]]s, which is uncommon for pressed oils. The seeds of many if not most members of the citrus family yield usable oils.

* [[Grapefruit seed extract|Grapefruit seed oil]], extracted from the seeds of [[grapefruit]] (''Citrus × paradisi''). Grapefruit seed oil was extracted experimentally in 1930 and was shown to be suitable for making soap.
* [[Lemon|Lemon oil]], similar in fragrance to the fruit. One of a small number of cold pressed essential oils.
* [[Orange oil]], like lemon oil, cold pressed rather than distilled.

===Speciality cooking oils: melon and gourd seed oils===
Members of the [[Cucurbitaceae]] include [[gourd]]s, [[melon]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]es. Seeds from these plants are noted for their oil content, but little information is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.<ref>[[#axtell|Axtell]], "[http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5043E/x5043E07.htm#Cucurbitaceae Cucurbitaceae]

==Oils used for biofuel==
{{Main|Vegetable oil as fuel}}
{{Main|Pure plant oil as fuel}}

A number of oils are used for [[biofuel]] ([[biodiesel]] and [[Vegetable oil used as fuel|Straight Vegetable Oil]]) in addition to having other uses. Other oils are used only as biofuel. (ie as [[ethanol]], [[methanol]] and [[butanol]])

Although [[diesel engine]]s were invented, in part, with [[vegetable fats and oils|vegetable oil]] in mind, diesel fuel is almost exclusively [[petroleum]]-based.  Vegetable oils are evaluated for use as a biofuel based on:
# Suitability as a fuel, based on [[flash point]], energy content, [[viscosity]], [[fire|combustion products]] and other factors
# Cost, based in part on [[Crop yield|yield]], effort required to grow and [[harvest]], and [[Post-harvest handling|post-harvest processing]] cost

===Multipurpose oils also used as biofuel===
The oils listed immediately below are all (primarily) used for other purposes – all but [[tung oil]] are edible – but have been considered for use as biofuel.
* [[Castor oil]], lower cost than many candidates. Kinematic [[viscosity]] may be an issue.
* [[Coconut oil]], a cooking oil, with medical and industrial applications as well. Extracted from the kernel or meat of the fruit of the [[coconut palm]]. Common in the tropics, and unusual in composition, with [[medium chain fatty acid]]s dominant.
* [[Colza oil]], from ''[[Brassica rapa]], var. oleifera'' (turnip) is closely related to [[rapeseed oil|rapeseed]] (or [[canola]]) oil. It is a major source of biodiesel in Germany.
* [[Corn oil]], appealing because of the abundance of [[maize]] as a crop.
* [[Cottonseed oil]], the subject of study for cost-effectiveness as a biodiesel feedstock.
* [[False flax oil]], from ''[[Camelina sativa]]'', used in Europe in [[oil lamp]]s until the 18th century.
* [[Hemp oil]], relatively low in emissions. Production is problematic in some countries because of its association with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].
* [[Mustard oil]], shown to be comparable to [[Canola|Canola oil]] as a biofuel.
* [[Palm oil]], very popular for biofuel, but the environmental impact from growing large quantities of [[oil palm]]s has recently called the use of palm oil into question.
* [[Peanut oil]], used in one of the first demonstrations of the [[Diesel engine]] in 1900.
* [[Radish#Industry|Radish oil]]. Wild radish contains up to 48% oil, making it appealing as a fuel.
* [[Ramtil oil]], used for lighting in [[India]].
* [[Rice bran oil]], appealing because of lower cost than many other vegetable oils. Widely grown in Asia.
* [[Safflower|Safflower oil]], explored recently as a biofuel in [[Montana]].
* [[Salicornia oil]], from the seeds of ''[[Salicornia|Salicornia bigelovii]]'', a [[halophyte]] (salt-loving plant) [[native plant|native]] to [[Mexico]].
* [[Soybean|Soybean oil]], not economical as a fuel crop, but appealing as a byproduct of soybean crops for other uses.
* [[Sunflower oil]], suitable as a fuel, but not necessarily cost effective.
* [[Cyperus esculentus#Use as oil|Tigernut oil]] has been described by researchers in China as having "great potential as a biodiesel fuel."
* [[Tung oil]], referenced in several lists of vegetable oils that are suitable for biodiesel.

===Inedible oils used only or primarily as biofuel===
{{see also|Algae fuel}}

These oils are extracted from plants that are cultivated solely for producing oil-based biofuel.<ref group="note">There are some plants that yield a commercial vegetable oil, that are also used to make other sorts of biofuel. [[Eucalyptus]], for example, has been explored as a means of [[biomass]] for producing [[ethanol]]. These plants are not listed here.</ref> These, plus the [[List of vegetable oils#Major oils|major oils]] described above, have received much more attention as fuel oils than other plant oils.

* [[Copaiba]], an [[Resin|oleoresin]] tapped from species of [[genus]] ''[[Copaifera]]''. Used in [[Brazil]] as a cosmetic product and a major source of [[biodiesel]].
* [[Honge oil]] (Pongamia), pioneered as a [[biofuel]] by Udipi Shrinivasa in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].
* [[Jatropha oil]], widely used in [[India]] as a fuel oil. Has attracted strong proponents for use as a [[biofuel]].
* [[Jojoba oil]], from the ''[[Jojoba|Simmondsia chinensis]]'', a desert shrub.
* [[Euphorbia tirucalli|Milk bush]], popularized by [[chemist]] [[Melvin Calvin]] in the 1950s. Researched in the 1980s by [[Petrobras]], the [[Brazil]]ian national petroleum company.
* Nahor oil, pressed from the kernels of ''[[Mesua ferrea]]'', is used in [[India]] as a [[lamp oil]].
* [[Simarouba glauca|Paradise oil]], from the seeds of ''[[Simarouba glauca]]'', has received interest in India as a feed stock for biodiesel.
* Petroleum nut oil, from the Petroleum nut (''[[Pittosporum resiniferum]]'') native to the [[Philippines]]. The Philippine government once explored the use of the petroleum nut as a biofuel.
