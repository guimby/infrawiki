The showers at [[Rancho Mastatal]] were made using natural building techniques including lime plaster, [[tadelakt plaster]], [[natural paint|clay paint]], and [[mortise and tenon]]. They were constructed in 2007 by local, volunteer, and student labor. It took about 6 months to complete, and the final cost was approximately USD $5000.

| This shower stall was made using a tadelakt plaster technique. It is waterproof and requires no maintenance. The stall on the other side was made with a lime plaster lath that was pasted with horse hair and between small wooden strips. The walls done with the lime plaster do require regular refinishes.

| Bamboo was used to support the piping and the shower head. The frame of the structure was made by connecting timber with a mortise and tenon technique.

| The floor was decided to be cement, because any natural plaster would wear away too quickly with regular shower use.
