==Abstract==
[[image:Switch-reprap.jpg|right]]
===Purpose===

Open-source [[RepRap]] 3-D printers have made distributed manufacturing and prototyping an affordable reality. This paper presents novel modifications to a RepRap design that increase RepRap capabilities well beyond just fused filament fabrication.

===Design/methodology/approach===

The design is a significantly modified derivative of the Rostock delta-style RepRap 3-D printer. Modifications were made that permit easy and rapid repurposing of the platform for milling, paste extrusion and several other applications. All of the designs are open-source and freely available.

===Findings===

In addition to producing fused filament parts, the platform successfully produced milled printed circuit boards, milled plastic objects, objects made with paste extrudates such as silicone, food stuffs and ceramics, pen plotted works and cut vinyl products. '''The multi-purpose tool saved 90-97% of the capital costs of functionally equivalent dedicated tools'''.

===Research limitations/implications===

While the platform was used primarily for production of hobby and consumer goods, research implications are significant since the tool is so versatile and the fact that the designs are open-source and eminently available for modification for more purpose-specific applications.

===Practical implications===

The platform vastly broadens capabilities of a RepRap machine at an extraordinarily low price, expanding the potential for distributed manufacturing and prototyping of items that heretofore required large financial investments.

===Originality/value===

The unique combination of relatively simple modifications to an existing platform have produced a machine having capabilities far exceeding that of any single commercial product. The platform provides users the ability to work with a wide variety of materials and fabrication methods at a price of less than $1,000 providing users are willing to build the machine themselves.

==Mobile tools==

===Tool end effector===
The tool end effector (tool effector) permits easy and fast change out of mobile tools. It is necessary to use the other mobile tools covered in this section.
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector0.JPG|thumb|right|Dress the tool effector.]]With a precision knife and flat bladed screwdriver, clean the 12 magnet pockets in the printed tool end effector.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector1.JPG|thumb|right|Test fit magnets.]]Starting with the magnets that engage with the connecting rod bearings, insure they all fit snuggly in their pockets. Magnets should fit tightly to maintain geometry - be careful not to over-dress the pockets so that the magnets become loose in them. '''Do not let the magnets slam together'' - they are brittle and easily break.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector2.JPG|thumb|right|Remove magnets with a small screwdriver.]]Remove magnets from pockets using a small flat blade screwdriver to pry them out.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector3.JPG|thumb|right|Epoxy magnets in their pockets.]]Mix a small amount of plastic epoxy per the instructions on the epoxy's packaging. Apply epoxy to the walls and floor of the magnet pockets that were cleaned and checked, above.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector4.JPG|thumb|right|Press magnets into pockets with countersink facing out.]]Press magnets with countersink facing out into the pockets with epoxy. Magnets should be inserted so that nearest neighbors attract each other through the bottom of the pocket. This helps to keep them in place if the magnets are slightly loose in their pockets.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector5.JPG|thumb|right|Remove excess epoxy.]]Remove excess epoxy from the interior of the magnets with a paper towel. HINT: Let the epoxy cure for a short time and use a small flat bladed screwdriver to scrape the gelled epoxy out, then follow up with a paper towel.{{clear}}
# Set the end effector aside until the epoxy cures.{{clear}}
# [[File:MOST_tool_effector6.JPG|thumb|right|Epoxy magnets in tool mount pockets. Use pliers as shown, if necessary.]]Repeat the process with the magnet pockets for the tool mount, again orient the magnets on the top and bottom of the end effector so that they hold themselves in place. Use pliers to press fully into the pockets, if necessary.{{clear}}
# Use the precision knife and a flat bladed screwdriver to remove any remaining epoxy from the magnets' interiors. The surface that mates with the ball bearing must be free of all epoxy.{{clear}}

==Fixed Tools==
Fixed tools are secured in place by a structure made of 25mm x 75mm (1" x 3") rectangular extruded aluminum that replaces one of the vertical boards on the robot. The vertical aluminum member is 81cm long, the horizontal member is 15cm long. The horizontal member is held in place by a pair of 3mm (1/8") thick aluminum gussets secured with M4 x 12mm screws into tapped holes in the vertical and horizontal struts. The vertical member is secured to the robot's frame with M3 x 45mm screws that pass through the existing vertical board mount points in the idler and motor ends. 3mm holes are drilled and tapped (M3 x 0.5mm) for the extruder drive, placing it in the same position and orientation as shown in the MOST Delta frame assembly instructions. Larger holes are also drilled in the vertical member to permit the passage and concealment of wires.

Tools are secured to the mount by a magnetic mount consisting of three rare earth magnets (19mm diameter x 12mm high (3/4" x 1/2") countersunk N52 magnets) mounted to the top of the horizontal member and three mating 25mm (1") diameter ball bearings on the tool holder. The magnets are held in place with stainless steel, countersunk M4 screws in holes drilled and tapped in the horizontal member. The position and orientation of the holes is set by use of a printed template (TBD).

In order to assure that the tools are tightly secured to the mount, and in the case of the mill spindle, do not vibrate, the ball bearing pockets are over-sized. Ball bearings are epoxied into the tool holder while they are seated in the magnets on the horizontal mount.

===Mill spindle holder===
The mill spindle holder (spindle holder) accepts a low cost, 200-400W DC spindle motor that turns at 12,000 rpm when supplied with 48V power. The spindle comes with an ER11 collet that accepts 3.125mm (1/8") shank bits and end mills. These instructions assume the spindle has been properly wired to a suitable power supply.
