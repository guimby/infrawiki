{{Hexayurt header}}

'''A large body of do-it-yourself hexayurt building information has been created by Vinay Gupta and average folk who made their own. Incidentally, a lot of the average folks attend the Burning Man Arts Festival, which is hosted in a windy, hot desert. Hexayurts made with rigid insulation are great in that environment. Whatever you're planning to build a hexayurt for, you can find all variety of hexayurt shapes and sizes, and instructions at [[Hexayurt playa]].  If you're interested in more about plywood hexayurts, see hexayurt.com.'''
