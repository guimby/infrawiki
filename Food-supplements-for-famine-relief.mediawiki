In a famine, special [[foods]] are needed which act as [[nutritional supplements]], to quickly build strength and restore malnourished individuals.

Some important examples:
* [[Unimix]]{{w|Unimix}} is a vitamin-enriched flour for making [[porridge]].
* [[Plumpy'nut]]{{w|Plumpy'nut}} is a high [[protein]] and high [[energy]] [[peanut]]-based paste in a foil wrapper. It is fortified with vitamins and is slightly sweeter than [[peanut butter]]. It is easy for children to eat. It is categorized as a Ready-to-Use [[Therapeutic food|Therapeutic Food]] (RUTF). It has a 2 year shelf life, and is easy to deploy in difficult conditions. It is distributed under medical supervision, and used together with Unimix (above). Ingredients: peanut paste, [[vegetable oil]], [[powdered milk]], [[powdered sugar]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[mineral]]s.
* [[Atmit]]{{w|Atmit}} is used in [[famine relief]]. Ingredients: rolled oats, powdered milk, powdered sugar, vitamins, and minerals, and is used to feed severely malnourished and weakened adults and children. During 1985 and 1986 it was used in Ethiopia<ref>Project Mercy sent 930 tons to Ethiopia{{fact}}</ref>, and it has been used in other countries since then.

== Cautions ==
* Malnourishment may occur for reasons other than an externally-imposed crisis, such as [[drought]] or war, e.g. poor dietary habits, growing foods that are inadequate for good nutrition. These reasons need to be seriously addressed as well.<ref>E.g. see the anecdote about distributing Plumpy'Nut in Rwanda, in [http://aidwatchers.com/2010/04/the-plumpy%E2%80%99nut-dustup/#comment-11240 this blog comment].</ref>
* Even resistance to drought might be able to be mitigated through appropriate food growing techniques, choice of crops, and especially [[rainwater harvesting]] techniques such as [[groundwater recharge]]. Of course, these are long term solutions, and do not affect the need for effective food supplements in the short term.
