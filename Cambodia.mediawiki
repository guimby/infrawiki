[http://awarecam.org.au/ Awareness Cambodia] ([[wikipedia:Awareness Cambodia|Wikipedia]]) Sunshine House is a project of Awareness Cambodia. In 2000, land was purchased in Kampong Speu, and the first buildings were erected to make a home for children orphaned due to the ravages of AIDS. In June 2002 a fully functional Eco Farm was developed adjacent to Sunshine House. All facets of the farm are aimed at being environmentally friendly, recyclable and self-sustaining. In time it is also planned as an income source for Sunshine House. Over the next 5 years Awareness Cambodia is looking to transform Sunshine House from its current “small village” status into a larger community called “The Awareness Cambodia Community”. Awareness Cambodia has also stated that priority will be given to expanding their environmentally friendly approach in all existing projects through initiatives such as solar power, methane collection, and sustainable water use. <ref>[[wikipedia:Awareness Cambodia]]</ref>

=== Citizens data initiative ===

[http://www.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/ Open Development Cambodia] (ODC) is an ‘open data’ website, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. The open data movement is based on the simple premise that data collected for public interest should be publicly available without restrictions. Information or data in the public domain should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish. Open Development Cambodia does not promote any particular perspective, agenda or bias other than to provide objective information about Cambodia and its development.
