==Abstract==
This is a cross-flow turbine<ref> Wikipedia: Cross-flow turbine Available: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-flow_turbine</ref>, basically a water wheel turned by stream to produce energy. This provides energy without the cost of fossil fuels; while the only time and energy used to work on it is occasional maintenance and set up. This would used in developing areas around the world because it is much cheaper and less time consuming to make. The material cost of this turbine itself is significantly reduced using 3D-printing.

== Bill of Materials==
# PLA or ABS Filament (1.75mm)
# All of the STL files and the SCAD files are [http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1182583 here].
# Hexagon axle shaft

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
# Exacto Knife

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* 3D-printing
* 3D-modeling

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Place 3/8" hexagon shaft through printed turbine.
# Connect shaft to electric generator.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* Poorly fitting axle shaft, or broken vanes are both fixable with a small amount of epoxy

== Cost savings==

# The micro-turbine is about $1.00 
# Cost savings depend on the size of the wheel.
# Micro-turbine plants can cost up to $20000<ref>Wikipedia: Micro Hydro Available:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_hydro</ref>.
