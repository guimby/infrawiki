Small houses offer a lower environmental impact, and a philosophy of [[voluntary simplicity]].

Small houses are also attainable by people who might otherwise be shut out of the housing market - which is a significant proportion of people today.

== Lower environmental impact ==

The lower impact comes through:
* Fewer resources used in construction.
* Less space to heat or cool.
* Less land used up, meaning:
** More green space
** Less hard surface and resulting [[stormwater]] runoff, and more space for [[water]] to be naturally absorbed into the ground.
** Dwellings closer together, meaning higher [[population density]], making [[public transport]] more feasible.

== Personal freedom ==

* Leaves more money for other things.
* Small houses (often specifically called [[tiny houses]]) are sometimes built on trailers, and can be moved easily.
