'''Carbon emissions''' are the major cause of [[climate change]], through increasing the natural greenhouse effect. 

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is the major greenhouse gas, but other gases such as methane have a much higher greenhouse impact per atom of carbon.

Dealing with this and avoiding catastrophic climate change is an enormous task, and requires multiple strategies, including:
* [[Simple living]]
* [[Carbon pricing]] - arguably the most effective motivation for living just a little more simply, or making more carbon-friendly consumer choices.
* [[Carbon sequestration]], for example [[carbon capture and storage]] (a controversial technique which has yet to be applied at a large scale).
