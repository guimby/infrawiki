==Introduction==
The African American Environmentalist Association ([http://www.aaenvironment.com/ AAEA]), founded in 1985, is a national, nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to protecting the environment, enhancing human, animal and plant ecologies, promoting the efficient use of natural resources and increasing African American participation in the environmental movement.

==Goals==
AAEA's main goals are to deliver environmental information and services directly into communities. We work to clean up neighborhoods by implementing toxics education, energy, water and clean air programs. AAEA includes an African American point of view in environmental policy decision-making and resolves environmental racism and injustice issues through the application of practical environmental solutions. It is one of the nation's oldest African American-led environmental organizations and we welcome all races interested in working for improvements in the African American community.

If not, the points can of course be challenged/explained here. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] &middot; <small>[[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]</small> 06:39, 28 October 2007 (PDT)</ref>
