== Summary ==
'''[[Green wikis]]''': Although "green wikis" are mostly not about [[appropriate technology]] and thus outside the focus of this study, there are many potential lessons for appropriate technology collaborations:
* Many of the motives are the same, although the participants in green wikis are probably not as extremely technically oriented as  those working on [[open design]] projects. 
* There are many more green wikis (and other green collaborations), thus offering a richer set of data, to supplement the experience of appropriate technology open collaborations.
