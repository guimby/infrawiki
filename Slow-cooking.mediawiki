'''Slow cooking''' can be an easy and delicious way to prepare meals, usually by keeping a pot of food at or near boiling point for several hours. Cleaning up can be easier too, as it generally means cooking below the temperature where the food will burn and stick.

If done correctly, it can be an energy efficient method also, which saves energy costs, and in cases of indoor fires, reduces exposure to harmful [[indoor smoke]].

Slow cooking may be achieved with:
* Electric crock pots
* [[Insulated cookers]]
* [[Solar cookers]]
* [[Integrated cooking]] (combining solar, insulated and efficient wood cooking as appropriate)

'''Warning''': [[Beans]] should be cooked for at least 20 minutes at boiling point.<ref>At very high latitudes, boiling point may not be enough - a pressure cooker may be needed.{{fact}}</ref>
