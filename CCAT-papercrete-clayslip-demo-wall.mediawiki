== Introduction ==
[[Image:CCAT Fall 08.jpeg|thumb|left|CCAT Fall 2008]]
[[Image:Mud Hands.jpg|thumb|right|Gettin Dirty with Natural Construction]]
{{TOCright}}The [[Campus Center for Appropriate Technology]], located in Arcata, CA needs an information kiosk.  Constructed, with the help of CCAT and student volunteers, from stick frame and infilled with [[papercrete]] and [[clay-slip]] straw with a recycled brick base, and covered by a cedar shingle roof.  This wall will then have information signs attached for visitors of CCAT campus.

== Project Requirements ==
The goal is to construct a test wall that both suits the wet climate of [[Humboldt County, California]] and is useful to CCAT.

The Criteria for this project (and other projects of this scale) could look like this: 
----
*Durability (''How long are the materials specified to last?'')
*Construction Time (''What climate and material conditions limit time?'')
*Complexity (''Can construction be completed by the layperson?'')
*Cost (''How much will you spend?'')
*Locality of Materials (''How far will you go to find materials?'')
----
These are basic criteria used to judge the design of this project. When each criterion is examined you can rank them according to importance.  For this project, locality of materials, complexity, and construction time were very important factors because this project is one, part of an Appropriate Technology class, two, being constructed by students of [[HSU]], and three, has to be completed in 15 short weeks.  
Ranking your criteria can be a powerful tool to assist in the timely and orderly design and construction of projects large and small.

== Design ==
[[Image:Test Wall Frame.jpg|thumb|right|frame with roof supports and gravel foundation]]
===Overview===
The foundation of this wall will be compacted soil with added gravel which will serve as the base for a 1ft tall layer of recycled brick layed in an interlocking pattern will sand mortar.  This brick footing serves to keep natural plasters and infill material from coming in direct contact with the ground. The use of sand as mortar also allows the brick foundation to act as a wicking barrier helping to relive the wall of built up moisture through the seasons. [[Image:Interlocking Brick Foundation.jpg|thumb|left|This brick pattern allowed for this foundation to be made without mortar]]The wall is framed by two driftwood logs and in-filled half by paper-crete bricks, half by clay-slip-straw, which is held in place by a recycled wood lath; and is covered by a combination of natural and lime plasters.  The driftwood serves as a border for infill sections and to support a small a-frame pitched roof above covered with cedar shingles (seen to the right). 
[[Image:Complete Frame.jpg|thumb|right|The roof will protect the wall from the harsh rains]]
  
===Specs===
*8 ft long, 4ft tall, 16in wide in a gentle S curve shape
*Roof dimensions, 9ft long 5.5ft high at peak, with 18in pitches on each side from peak
*Timber frame made from reclaimed timber and driftwood logs, simple 4x4s could work fine
*Recycled brick footing 1ft tall, 1ft wide, mortared with riversand 
*One 4 by 4ft section in-filled with papercrete bricks mortared together with papercrete slurry
*One 4 by 4ft section stick framed with wood lath to hold infill of clay-slip-straw
*To be covered by earth/lime plasters by another student in ENGR 305 class

== Testing ==
The first phase of the project after designing is to test CCAT's [[soil]] type and paper-crete mixtures. [[Image:The Shake Test.jpg|thumb|left|Shown are the proper proportions of sand, clay, and silt for natural building]] A [[soil shake test]] seen to the left proved that CCAT has the perfect clay for doing natural construction and will work well for our purposes of clay-slip-straw.[[Image:Test brick.jpg|thumb|right|The first two test mixtures!]]
[[Image:Drying bricks.jpg|thumb|right|Drying papercrete bricks in a sunny window]]  
Next to test is the paper-crete mixture. The first test brick was made with a 1:2:1 ratio of paper to cement to water.  This made a very soupy mixture that took weeks to dry, but, when it did it was as hard as concrete.  After about 6 test mixtures the final ratio that seemed suitable was 3:2:3:1 of paper:Cement:Water:Sand.  The use of less [[water]] and additive of sand made the bricks shrink less during drying and dry faster.  The sand also increases thermal mass and helps with fire resistance.  The resulting bricks (shown drying in a window to the right) dried solid like a very hard paper-mache and were also a lot lighter in weight than there would be concrete counterparts. The proportions that I used were what seemed appropriate for the Arcata area.  More standard and researched recipes for paper-crete can be found from the [[#Links to Relevent Sites|Links]] and [[#References (Annotated)|References]] at the bottom of this page or at [http://papercrete.wikidot.com/recipes:block-starter Paper-crete Block Starter].

== Conclusions and Reflection ==
Because of relatively good planning and readiness of materials this project was quite feasible and enjoyable.  Were it not for the collective help of volunteers and the [[ENGR 305]] class this project may have never been finished. 
Having now finished there are some things i would do differently in the future.
#I would not have made bricks from the papercrete.  The bricks all of slightly different size and shape and with different levels of moisture in them were not ideally suited for building a wall.  Using larger forms that contain larger wall sections with tensile reinforcement like [[bamboo]] or scrap [[metal]] would have been a lot easier and required a lot less paper.
#Just a note, paper-crete takes forever to dry in a coastal climate, especially if there is not enough cement in the mixture and too much water.  Some applications I have researched suggest straining the paper-crete through a wire mesh to relieve it of a portion of its water helps it to dry a lot faster.
#I would have liked to have experimented more with different types of paper in the mixtures I made. The shredded paper was so readily available it was all that I used.  Word of mouth and research suggests that using different types of paper (e.g. newspaper, magazines) produces a significantly different consistency of paper-crete.  So I would suggest experimenting to see which type is most appropriate to your project.  
#Even if your project is small, get others involved! The process of natural building can be fun and educational and most of all it brings people together with one goal in mind, to build something maybe new and exciting that is a hands on alternative to conventional building practices.

:•	'''Callahan, Tim, and Clarke Snell. Building Green: A Complete How-To Guide to Alternative Building Methods Earth Plaster * Straw Bale * Cord wood * Cob * Living Roofs. New York: Lark Books, 2005.'''
In this very complete 600 plus pages guidebook, Callahan and Snell demonstrate alternative building methods of cob, straw bale, earth plaster, cord wood and living roofs.  The book is filled with history, applications, methods, and afterthoughts from the authors’ firsthand experience with building all of the above listed alternative building methods.  The book also provides step by step building processes with notes on basic construction of foundations, walls, doorframes, drainage trenches, trussing, and site preparation.  Contains over 150 pages on proper calculations for soil, r-value, shrinkage, stick frame construction, and environmental specs. Thoroughly covers natural wall construction and earthen plasters in a manner that an amateur could understand.

:•	'''Norton, John. Building with Earth: A Handbook. London: Practical Action, 1997.'''
This handbook has practical applications for choosing whether or not earthen construction is appropriate or suitable for your site as well as an overview of how to build with earth.  Contains a synopsis of the logistics for site appropriateness, soil testing, earthquake considerations, costs, resource use.  Continues on to explain wall construction using the methods of wattle and daub, direct moulding, adobe, mud brick, rammed earth, and compressed blocks.  The handbook continues to describe the same tone roofs, foundations and floors, and weather protection.  Most of the experience the author has comes from earthen construction in Africa and China.  This handbook has good overview of earth building, but lacks the attention to detail that a novice earth builder would need to begin construction.   

:•	'''How to build walks, walls & patio floors, (A Sunset book, 170). Menlo Park, CA: Lane Books, 1973.'''
This book is a rather contemporary overview of building walls, walks, and patio floors.  It explains wall building foundations and materials for use that include brick, stone, adobe bricks, and concrete cast.  This book does explain to good depth the different types of patio and walk construction.  It includes loose aggregate, concrete with many alterations to it including pebble mosaics, brick, adobe brick, tile, flagstone, and asphalt.  Goes over most contemporary or western brick styles for walls and floors; this book requires a previous understanding of general construction to utilize properly.
