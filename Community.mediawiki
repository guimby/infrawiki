{{topic header| default.png |Community}}

Essential knowledge about '''community''' relates to:
* Process - the creating and maintaining of community, e.g. see [[community participation]]
* Actual communities, both [[online communities|online]] and offline.
* The physical environment and facilities that can either facilitate community, or discourage it. See [[urban planning]].

Articles on specific subjects about community are found at the [[:Category:Community|category page]].

== Online communities ==

{{main|Online communities}}

'''Online communities''' are a special case, with their own advantages (you can join from anywhere) and challenges (lack of face-to-face communication, lack of regular incidental interaction in the physical world). The "[[Online communities]]" article lists many useful resources for understanding how communities grow, and the many challenges. [[How to make a successful new wiki]] discusses the specific challenges of building a wiki community.


== Intentional communities ==
