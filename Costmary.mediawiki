Costmary (''Tanacetum balsamita'') is a hardy, perennial herb. It is native to Southwestern Asia and has become naturalised across Europe.

Costmary is also known as alecost or mint geranium. Alecost was a name derived from its addition to ale in medieval times.

== Description ==

Costmary has narrow, pointed oval shaped leaves. 

It has small flowers with a yellow button shaped centre and white petals.

== Growing costmary ==

Costmary is an easy-to-grow herb, and can become invasive easily, so perhaps consider confining it to a container. Sow the seeds in a warm and sunny position. Or, use divisions of the plant. Grow in soil that drains well. Don't over water, it likes drier soil. 

If grown in shade, expect fewer flowers.

If it is grown in the garden, remove it when it pops up in unwanted places, otherwise it'll take over the garden.

== Uses for costmary ==

The plant doesn't have many modern uses as it was found to be quite toxic. Thus, if you read anything about using it as a flavouring, enjoy the knowledge that this was once done but don't attempt it now. Its main use is as an ornamental herb with pretty flowers. It also has a pleasant fragrance, a sweet balsam mint scent.
