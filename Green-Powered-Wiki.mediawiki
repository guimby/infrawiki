The '''Green Powered Wiki''' at wiki.greenpowered.org, now defunct, was a wiki focused on [[renewable energy]]. 

It was [http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/07/a_green_powered.php written up in Treehugger] in 2005, but it is not known what happened to the drivers and contributors in the project. (If you know, please let us know, by editing this page or leaving a note on the {{talk page}} - we would love to know if they are still interested in this vision.)

[[Appropedia]] covers this same scope (but is also broader). The [[BioEnergy Wiki]] covers a subset of this topic area. For other active wikis, see [[green wikis]].
