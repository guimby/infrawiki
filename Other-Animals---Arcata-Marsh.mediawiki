===American Toad===
[[Image:toad_hero.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 1. American Toad ''Bufo americanus'']]
'''Location:'''<br />
The American Toad, ''Bufo Americanus'', is native to the Nearctic region. They inhabit large portions of North America.  The American Toad needs a semi permanent source of water to use in the breeding season.  These toads have an ability to adapt to their environment.  This has allowed them to colonize suburban and agricultural areas and the Arcata marsh area. <br />
'''Habitat:'''<br />
American toad require a semi-permanent freshwater pond for early development.  They can be found in temperate, terrestrial, and freshwater habitat.  They prefer areas with dense patches of vegetation and feed on insects.  American toads can be found in many different places from forests to backyards and even in a marsh.  They are commonly found in gardens and fields.  During the day the American toad will seek shade.  When to cold weather comes around the American toad digs backwards into the ground to hibernate.<br />
'''Physical Description:'''<br />  
American toads are characterized by warty skin, stout bodies and short legs. The American toad has many glands in its skin that can produce a poisonous fluid, it provides protection from predators.  This poison may be harmful if it is swallowed or gets in a persons eyes, but it can make other animals very sick.
American toad are usually a shade of brown, somtimes with red and light patches , of olive or gray. The skin color may change depending on temperature , humidity, and stress.  Color changes range from yellow to brown to black.
Females are slightly larger than male American toad.  The size of a typical American Toad ranges from 50 to 100 mm.<br />
'''Reproduction:'''<br />
Breeding occurs during March and April, sometimes it may extend until July.  American Toad larvae hatch from eggs to become tadpoles.  Larvae have produce chemicals in their skin for protection.  A metamorphosed toadlet are usually 0.8 to 1.3 cm in length and have similar coloration to adult American toad.<br />  
'''Behavior:'''<br />
American toad are generally nocturnal.  They are more active in warm humid weather.  American Toad are solitary, congregating for breeding.  The average American toad lives 1 to 2 years; though it has been documented that an American toad lived to 36 years old.<br />
'''Food Habits:'''<br />
Adult American toad are carnivores, but American toad tadpoles are herbivores.  Tadpoles graze on aquatic vegetation (algae).
Adult American toad eat a variety of insects and other invertebrates, including snails, beetles, slugs, and earthworms.  An American toad can eat up to 1,000 insects per day.  Interestingly, American toad do not drink water, rather they absorb moisture through their skin.

'''Location:'''<br />
The California Newt, ''Taricha torosa'', along with four other variety of newt family (Salamandridae) inhabit California.  It is generally located on the Coastal Range of California from Mexico to Humboldt County.<br />
'''Habitat:'''<br />
The northern population of California Newt prefers mesic forests whereas the southern population of newts prefer a drier climate <br /> 
'''Physical Description:'''
An adult California Newt is typically 12.5-20 cm in length.  Males are slightly larger than females.<br />
'''Reproduction:'''<br />
The mating season for the California Newt is from December to early May. The female California Newt will lay egss in ponds, lakes and slow moving streams in water typically not deeper than 15 cm.  The incubation period is usually 14-21 days.  Incubation may last longer depending on weather conditions.<br />  
'''Behavior'''<br />
The California Newt has a unique way of defending itself.  The California Newt will show is bright underbelly and if attacked it excretes a neurotoxin through its skin which can cause paralysis to the attacker.  It may make a clicking or yelping sound when it is disturbed.  Amazingly the excretions on the California Newts skin allows them to walk through low smoldering flames.<br />
'''Food Habits:'''<br />
The California Newt uses its tongue to capture its prey; its tongue has an adhesive texture.  An adult California Newt's diet contains earthworms, snails, slugs and sowbugs.  Occasionally adult newts cannibalize and eat their own eggs and/or larvae.

'''Reproduction:'''<br />
Pacific tree frog are mature for reproduction in about 1 year.  Breeding season is from January to the middle of May.  Males may attract a females a mile or even farther away, with a two toned mating call.  Females lay an egg mass of about 10 - 70 eggs.  It is laid in a pond (temporary) attached to vegetation.  In 3 to 4 weeks tadpoles hatch from the eggs.<br />
'''Behavior:''' <br />
Pacific tree frog are solitary animals, though during breeding season they might congregate.  They are nocturnal and territorial.  At night Males ward off other Males with a two toned mating call.  It is considerably loud for the size of the animal.  Pacific tree frog can change color with depending on the temperature and humidity.<br />
'''Food Habits:'''<br />
Pacific tree frog tadpoles eat aquatic vegetation (algae).  When they transform into adults their diet changes.  Adult Pacific tree frogs eat insects: tiny gnats, flies, and mosquitoes.  They stick their tongue out and catch prey.<br />
