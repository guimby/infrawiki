===Force Testing Protocol:===
====Using an Instron 4206 Tensile Test Machine with a 10kN Load Cell====
DOES NOT NEED CALIBRATION
#Set the raspberry pi to max current.
#Only put the plunger of the syringe in the pump, not the entire syringe.
#Place the pump, motor down, in a tensile strength tester. Set height of the load cell to be just above the pump. 
#Then tell the pump to push past the top plate.
#Record the force given in Newtons.
