#redirect [[handwashing]]
I created a simple hand wash station for Sunday School in North East Thailand. Watch the video: http://www.ourmedia.org/node/265218

'''Description''': The watering can is suspended, with a cord attached to the nozzle. The cord is attached to one end of a stick (perhaps 50 cm or 20 inches long) on the ground, adjusted so that one end of the stick lies on the ground, and the other is raised slightly. The user steps on the stick, dropping the nozzle and enabling them to wash without touching anything with their hands. 

'''Suggestion''': perhaps redirecting the cord around a pole or pulley would make it easier for the user to keep their feet dry? --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] 02:26, 9 November 2006 (PST)
