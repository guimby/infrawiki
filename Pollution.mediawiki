'''Pollution''' is a harmful waste in the [[environment]], produced by humans artificially. Some pollution breaks down quickly, and some might take thousands or millions of years to breakdown. 

Pollution is best avoided by greater efficiency and by treating waste as a resource: [[No such thing as garbage]]. This is the heart of [[industrial ecology]].
