You can '''make the most of a home garden''' with these tips:

* Choose foods that you love, that you can't easily get fresh.
* Choose varieties for great flavors, rather than regular shop varieties. E.g. some [[tomato]] varieties, such as Black Russian and other heirloom varieties, are deliciously different, but soft and unsuitable for storage, so you're unlikely to get them from a shop.
* Plant some foods that are excellent fresh - e.g. [[corn]] (pick and cook within 20 minutes for best results!) or [[broccoli]] (pick and use within hours), and green leafy vegetables. Most vegetables are best when very fresh, but with some it's especially important.
* Put the most frequently used plants within easy reach - have herbs and some salad vegetables near the door, so you can step out of the kitchen and pick things when you need them.
