===Description===
[[image:Feedingeveryone.jpg|left]]
The book '''Feeding Everyone No Matter What''' presents a scientific approach to the practicalities of planning for long-term interruption to food production.

Mass human starvation is currently likely if global agricultural production is dramatically reduced for several years following a global catastrophe: e.g. super volcanic eruption, asteroid or comet impact, nuclear winter, abrupt climate change, super weed, super crop pathogen, super bacterium, or super crop pest. Even worse, such a catastrophe may cause the collapse of civilization, and recovery is not guaranteed. Therefore, this could affect many future generations.

The primary historic solution developed over the last several decades is increased [[food storage]]. However, storing up enough food to feed everyone would take a significant amount of time and would increase the price of food, killing additional people due to inadequate global access to affordable food. Humanity is far from doomed, however, in these situations - there are solutions.

This book provides an order of magnitude technical analysis comparing caloric requirements of all humans for five years with conversion of existing vegetation and fossil fuels to edible food. It presents mechanisms for global-scale conversion including: natural gas-digesting bacteria, extracting food from leaves, and conversion of fiber by enzymes, mushroom or bacteria growth, or a two-step process involving partial decomposition of fiber by fungi and/or bacteria and feeding them to animals such as beetles, ruminants (cows, deer, etc), rats and chickens. It includes an analysis to determine the ramp rates for each option and the results show that careful planning and global cooperation could ensure the bulk of humanity and biodiversity could be maintained in even in the most extreme circumstances.

===Key Features===

* Summarizes the severity and probabilities of global catastrophe scenarios, which could lead to a complete loss of agricultural production
* More than 10 detailed mechanisms for global-scale solutions to the food crisis and their evaluation to test their viability
* Detailed roadmap for future R&D for human survival after global catastrophe

===Readership===

Researchers, professionals and students in food security, food engineering, disaster management and public health, preppers

==Praise for ''Feeding Everyone No Matter What''==
* "This book lays out the agenda for a new research field: how to feed the world in the event of a global catastrophe. This could be the most important research we hope never to have to use. Denkenberger and Pearce take a hard-nosed look at where we could turn for food in the event of the collapse of agriculture. Their ideas are innovative and striking, and surely worthy of further development."  -- Robert Wiblin | Executive Director | The Centre for Effective Altruism, housed in University of Oxford

* "It’s a fascinating read that gives us some great insight about not only a probably state of agriculture but also how different or similar it is to our current state. " - Christian Arca

*"When I first read their manuscript, I was immediately struck by how fearless Denkenberger and Pearce are in taking on really big problems. This book is a real tour-de-force, and represents a practical, thoughtful response to seemingly catastrophic events. In addition, some of these solutions can have multiple benefits even in the absence of a global crisis, like reducing malnutrition where food supplies are currently inadequate, and sets out a research agenda that everyone can contribute to, from individuals to governments." ~Jeff Greenblatt
