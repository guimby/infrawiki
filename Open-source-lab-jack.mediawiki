This project is part of a collection on [[open source optics]] meant to radically reduce the cost of experimental optical equipment.

[[Image:open_source_lab_jack.jpg|thumb|left|Fig 1: Open-source lab jack]] This is a lab jack, which is a height adjustable platform ideal for mounting optomechanical sub-assemblies, which require height adjustment. Later we can automate it with a stepper motor and an [[Arduino]].

Lab jacks cost between about $30 and several hundred. Here you can make a customized lab jack for your applications for a few dollars.

BOM and instructions coming soon.
