=== Abstract===
The technological evolution of the [[3-D printer]], widespread internet access and inexpensive computing has made a new means of [[open design]] capable of accelerating self-directed [[sustainable development]]. This study critically examines how [[open source 3-D printer]]s, such as the [[RepRap]] and [[Fab@home]], enable the use of designs in the [[public domain]] to fabricate [[open source appropriate technology]] (OSAT), which are easily and economically made from readily available resources by local communities to meet their needs.  The current capabilities of open source 3-D printers is reviewed and a new classification scheme is proposed for OSATs that are technically feasible and economically viable for production. Then, a methodology for quantifying the properties of  printed parts and a research trajectory is outlined to extend the existing technology to provide complete village-level fabrication of OSATs.  Finally, conclusions are drawn on the potential for open source 3-D printers to assist in driving sustainable development.
