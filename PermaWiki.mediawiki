'''PermaWiki''' is the largest and longest-running wiki devoted to specifically to [[permaculture]]. It was founded by [[Graham Burnett]] in October 2005. As of late 2015, its content is being ported to Appropedia.

From the PermaWiki main page:

<blockquote>This wiki has been created to facilitate the exchange of information about [[permaculture]], [[sustainability]], [[environmentalism]] and [[organic gardening and farming]]. We want this to be a resource for [[permaculture designers, teachers, activists and students]] as well as anybody who wants to find out more, eventually creating an online, living and growing collaborative Permaculture Designers Manual.</blockquote>
