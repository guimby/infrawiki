==Abstract==
''A rainwater catchment system was designed and constructed at The Sanctuary in Arcata, CA. This project was completed for Humboldt State University class, ENGR 215 FALL 16, and is a collaboration between four students. The catchment system can hold up to 900 gallons of captured rainwater. A 55 gallon drum is used as the secondary storage. A 850 gallon pond acts as the primary storage for the system. The pond is covered with a bridge, for walking or storage, and the pond contains an overflow drain.''

== Background ==
Sacred Consulting is a team of four students in the Fall 2016 semester of ENGR 215 at Humboldt State University consists of: Jenna Davey, Karen Duarte, Richard Thompson, and Caleb Wegner. This group chose to design and construct a rainwater catchment system for the client. The client for this project is The Creative Sanctuary, a local non-profit art facility who promotes green technology, art, community involvement and sustainable living. Even though this client has one rainwater catchment system on the property already, there are 2 gutters currently not being used for collection. 

== Problem statement and criteria ==
Criteria and constraints are a set of useful guidelines to refer to when deciding which design best fits the needs of the client.

====Problem Statement====
The Creative Sanctuary has two rain gutters that are not being used to collect the water, and would like to use one or both of them as inputs to a rainwater catchment system.

====Criteria====
Below is a table that displays the criteria laid out to assist in the decision making process.

===Cost Table===
The costs in hours for this project are listed below. The total hours spent by the team both designing and implementing the system is 150 hrs.

The monetary costs of this project are minimal considering the amount of donated materials which came from the client, The Sanctuary. The total cost of the system is $83.88 and a breakdown of the cost of each item can be seen below.

==Testing Results==
The system is currently filling up and storing water, but has not had the chance to provide water to the garden because the rain has been sufficient enough up to this point in time.

==How to build==
In order to replicate the rainwater catchment system that was built for the Sanctuary, follow the steps below. YOU WILL NEED A SHOVEL.

 |File:Black hole in progress.jpg |Caption |1 | Dig a 7x6x5 hole. (or the dimensions of the hole you would like.)
 |File:Black hole in progress overflow.jpg |Caption |2 | Dig a shallow trench extending from a side of the pond with the lowest walls and heating downhill is necessary for the overflow drain. Any other necessary trenches can be dug at this time. ( take into consideration the placement of a first flush diverter and a secondary storage.
 |File:First flush attached to wall.jpg |Caption |3 | Installing first fish diverter (you can use a 20 gallon barrel)
 |File:Spigot drain.jpg |Caption |3.1 | First flush diverter and Secondary storage need to be fitted to their respected outlet. for the first flush, this will be a very small drain placed about one-third of the way up the barrel, allowing the sediment to fall to the bottom of the tank without clogging the drain. 
 |File:Foundation.jpg |Caption |4 | Create a secure foundation for the first flush diverter and secondary storage. It is suggested to put some type of concrete or very solid base under these storage units. 
 |File:Black hole secondary.jpg |Caption |5 | Installation of First flush diverter and secondary storage should be complete.
 |File:Black hole in progress carpet.jpg |Caption |5 | Layout carpet in the hole to protect from any sharp objects and place pond liner into the hole.
 |File:Roof to gutter to system .jpg |Caption |7 | Next, use pipes to link the gutters to the rainwater catchment system.(Piped need to be “dry-fitted.” )
 |File:Black hole quick disconnect.jpg |Caption |8| Use a permanent marker to number each connection and also mark a line to use for lining up the angles on each of the connections.  |File:Black hole quick disconnect.jpg |Caption |9 | Start priming and gluing the pipes together. Be careful to only glue the sections that can be installed as once piece because all of the connections will now be permanently in place.

== Maintenance ==
"The Black Hole" was designed to need as little regular maintenance as possible. Due to this there is only an estimated 7 hours per year in required maintenance. The breakdown of what tasks need to be done and the estimated cost are shown below.

=== Schedule ===
Every year the system needs a complete cleaning and winterization. This annual cleaning should be performed in the fall of the year before the rains start. This allows the system to be as clean as possible before filling with water.  If the entire system needs to be cleaned and the pond is full of water, that water must be emptied so that the pond liner can be removed to be cleaned. While the total cleaning time can vary, cleaning the pond liner should only take one hour if all the water has been removed.


The other task that will need to be completed is the emptying and cleaning of the first flush water diverter and the secondary tank. Occasionally, this first flush diverter will become clogged with debris and sediment. Time needed to empty and clean the first flush water diverter and secondary storage is estimated to take less than one half of an hour. This maintenance is recommended to be performed once a month.


In total the system should require under 7 hours of maintenance per year.

;Monthly
*Empty and clean secondary storage
*Empty and clean first flush diverter

;Yearly
*Remove/Clean/Replace pond liner
*Flush all pipes and clean gutters

== Troubleshooting ==
This is only how to troubleshoot basic operation. For complex issues, contact Lonny Grafman (HSU).

|-
! Problem
! Suggestion
|-
| Water is not flowing into the pond.
| Check flow by putting a hose into the gutter and find clogged area.
|-
| Water is dirty.
| First flush diverter is not draining properly.
|-
| Pond wall integrity
| Too much water in area surrounding the pond.
