<center>''For my final project in Alternative Energy Systems, I collaborated with Sharhesa Fife and Zach Schomp to create a greenhouse manual for the giving garden.  The manual includes detailed instructions on aquaponics, composting, and how to install a solar PV component. ''</center>

== Understanding the market ==

The greenhouse at Sierra Nevada College has shifted hands continually.  There has never consistently been one person, club, or entity to take over and make awesome things happen.  For a senior project, Sharhesa Fife decided to bring some order to the greenhouse and build and grow it into a living classroom for sustainability.  

== Project goals ==

# Assist Sharhesa in her senior project
# Create a detailed "How-to" guide for the greenhouse, so that any beginner could walk in, learn how things work, then operate it.
# Add a solar component to the greenhouse to create a sustainable living classroom. 

== Design ==
