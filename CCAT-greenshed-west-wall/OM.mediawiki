This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for [[CCAT greenshed west wall]]. Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.

== Summary ==

The CCAT greenshed west wall is a straw clay slip wall that was constructed using a wooden frame and filled with a straw and clay mix. Twenty-nine ‘liters of light’ are dispersed along the wall. The wall was finished using a lime plaster. The wall was well built, leaving very little required maintenance.

== Operation ==
[[File:StrawClaySlipTools.JPG|thumb|right|Fig. 1. Straw clay slip wall inside]]
*IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO MOUNT OR HANG ANYTHING DIRECTLY FROM THE STRAW CLAY SLIP WALL. Objects should be mounted to the wooden frame instead (Figure 1 shows wooden frame where things can be hung from).

*AVOID STACKING ITEMS AGAINST THE WALL that would prevent the wall from being able to breathe.

== Maintenance ==
[[File:CobWallMinorCrack.JPG|thumb|right|Fig. 2. Minor crack in plaster]]
*REPAIRING CRACKS AND FISSURES (See Instructions section below): Overtime, the straw clay slip wall will be subject to deterioration due to weathering. Minor cracks in the plaster do not pose a serious threat to the structural integrity of the wall. However, it may be beneficial to patch minor cracks with a plaster to prevent the inside from accumulating too much moisture, preventing mold growth and insect infiltration. The straw clay slip wall needs to breathe, so a lime plaster is recommended. Refer to [[CCAT greenshed west wall#plaster|this page ]] for detailed steps to recreating a similar plaster.

*PLASTER TOUCH-UP (See Instructions section below): Touching up the plaster is more for aesthetic reasons and not absolutely necessary. It can be helpful if the plaster is beginning to wear away or fade. 

=== Instructions ===

{{How to
 |title=PLASTER TOUCH-UP
 ||Filling the cavity |1 |Patch up any cracks or faults first
 ||Preparing lime wash |2 |Prepare a lime wash (lime putty, water, and desired pigment)
 ||Spraying wall with water |3 |Dampen the wall with water as evenly as possible using a spraying mechanism. This step is important in preventing the wall from absorbing water from the lime wash.
 |File:Plaster Tests.jpg |Test patches |4 |Do a test patch of your lime wash to make sure it is the color you desire 
 ||Applying lime wash |5 |Use brushes to apply lime wash and let dry thoroughly

{{How to
 |title=STITCHING FOR A CRACK OR FISSURE
 |File:CobWallMinorCrack.JPG |Cob wall fissure |1 |If fissure is deep but not large or wide enough to bother making a straw clay slip fill, carefully ram dry straw into the fissure. If crack or fissure is minor, proceed to next step.
 |File:100 0185b.jpg |Plaster preparation |2 |Prepare a lime plaster. Use a similar one to the one listed on the [[CCAT greenshed west wall]] page.
 ||Spraying wall with water |3 |Dampen the immediate area with an even spraying mechanism to prevent the wall from too quickly absorbing the water out of the fresh plaster. 
 |File:Good3.jpg |Applying plaster |4 |Evenly apply plaster and allow to dry.
