{{topic header| default.png | Flooding}} 

'''Flooding''' can range from inconvenient to deadly, and often results from human activities. Clearing of vegetation (especially forest), paving ground so that it cannot absorb water, and discarding litter (especially [[plastic bags]]) into [[waterways]], all exacerbate flooding.

== Reducing flooding ==

Flood levels can be reduced locally in several ways: 
* [[Swales]], [[rain gardens]], [[permeable pavements]] and other forms of [[groundwater recharge]], especially when implemented at higher levels, reducing the amount of water reaching the flood zones. [[Keyline farming]] can help in farming areas.
* Improving the water storage capacity of the [[soil]], through building a healthy soil with high [[humus]] content.

== Large scale flooding ==

Note that when the flooding is a result of larger scale hydrology, these may have little impact. They are still good things to do for their own sakes, but will have a relatively small impact when there massive quantities of water from outside the area.

In some cases, such as in [[Jakarta]], there is a combination of poorly designed development which increases [[stormwater]] runoff, litter which clogs drains, and a lack of adequate drainage (e.g. through lack of finances, or [[corruption|diversion of finances for other purposes]]. Suitable local measures such as [[absorption wells]] and banning single use non-[[compostable plastic|compostable]] [[plastic bags]], applied over a large enough area, could conceivably remove the need for the large scale, [[top-down]] stormwater solutions.

== Mitigating damage ==

* Setting housing back from flood zones. 
* Raising all sensitive/valuable things in the home, through shelves set high, or keeping valuable items on higher levels. Electrical outlets are also set high. This is often effective but:
** only protects against moderate floods, 
** may be inadequate in [[flash floods]] if some items need to be moved from the main living space to a higher level
* Setting houses on stilts, such as the traditional [[Queenslander]].
* Keeping an inflatable boat available in the highest part of the house, so it is possible to escape from an upper window as a last resort.
