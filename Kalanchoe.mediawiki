''Kalanchoe pinnata'' (Also ''Bryophyllum pinnata'') is a common herb with fleshy leaves. Kalanchoe is extremely easy to grow and often forms little plantlets along the leaf margin, which root easily. As an ornamental it is often called "air plant". It is used medicinally by indigenous peoples for many problems. This plant, in lab tests, has been shown to have significant antibacterial activity as well as anti-histamine and anti-allergic activity.

An infusion of the leaves or fresh juice from the leaves, are commonly used, internally and externally, for bacterial, viral or fungal infections as well as for leishmaniasis. It is good against pain, inflammations, earache and for upper respiratory infections, flu and fever.
