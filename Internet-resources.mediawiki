Also see [http://www.digglicious.com/ DiggLicious], which combines Digg with the del.icio.us site's links, on one site. (This actually combines them, rather than imitating, so any links in del.icio.us are also seen here and vice versa.)

==Technical databases==
* [http://graylit.osti.gov/ GrayLIT Network]. Searches unclassified and declassified US government scientific and engineering papers. (Research for government or military purposes may have broader applications in development applications and efficient design.)

==Online magazines==
*[http://www.developments.org.uk/ developments] - The International Development Magazine. A free quarterly magazine produced by the UK's Department for International Development to increase awareness of development issues.

==Podcasts and radio transcripts==
* The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/ BBC World Service] sometimes has information on developing world issues such as public health, affordable medicine, and toilets. E.g. see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1454_urbansolutions/page3.shtml this transcript page] and follow the links at the top. (See also the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/downloadtrial/ BBC podcast trial page] - but it may be hard to find relevant topics).
