Off grid system on fickle Hill Supervisor: Ben Scurfield 

With off-grid systems a different type of inverter is required. An Outback inverter was used for this home. A charge controller is also included on the right side of the unit to ensure proper charge of the batteries. The batteries need to be charged at a certain rate and for a particular amount of time to keep the batteries from overcharging. A gas release tube is needed to prevent hydrochloric gas from entering the fuse box or room.
