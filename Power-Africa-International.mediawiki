[[image:Powerafricalogo.png|left]] The mission of '''Power Africa International Inc'''. is to support the development of [[decentralized energy]] access and infrastructure in rural communities in the Sub-Sahara [[Africa]] through the formation and support of community power cooperatives in impoverished rural communities.

According to a World Bank finding, as many as 547 million people in the Sub-Sahara Africa region are without access to electricity. Less than half of this region will have universal access to electricity by 2050, thus depriving millions of people the opportunity to enhance their living standard.
