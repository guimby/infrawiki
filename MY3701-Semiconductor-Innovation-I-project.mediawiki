==MY3701 Semiconductor Innovation I project==

# Join your group of 5 (one group 6) self-selected student colleagues
# Download and install Libre Office if you do not already use it http://www.libreoffice.org/
# Read the background material for your randomly assigned semiconductor patent to the group.
## You may look up words that you don't know in your book or use the internet
## You must '''not''' look at any patents or search for key word blocks of text that could lead you to the patent
# Determine what the fundamental "improving feature" and "worsening feature" is of the technology that you have been randomly assigned. (e.g. create a generic problem to solve)
# Look up the solution of the generic problem in the Triz Matrix http://triz40.com/aff_Matrix.htm
# Click on solutions for descriptions of them to see what they are then look them up here http://triz40.com/aff_Principles.htm
# Generate real concrete solutions for your problem
----

Include all of the following in an ODT format document
# Your group number
# Your names as you would like them to appear in print (e.g. include your middle initial)
# Briefly summarize the real problem
# Your improving/worsening features for your abstract problem
# TRIZ abstract solution numbers/descriptions
# Then generate a list of concrete real solutions to your real problem -- make as many as you can - as detailed as you are able in bullet format.
# When the class runs out of time email pearce@mtu.edu and attach your ODT document.
