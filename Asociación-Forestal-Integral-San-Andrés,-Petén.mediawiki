AFISAP, which was founded in 1999, is focused on preserving the forests on a 52,000-hectare concession within the Mayan Biosphere Reserve in the San Andres area which plays a critical role in regional conservation. According to an AFISAP study that used remote cameras, the Mayan Reserve has the highest-density of jaguars ever reported in the world (11 jaguars/100 km2).

The organization, which has distinguished itself as one of the most successful community groups in [[Guatemala]], has also introduced projects to extract the lucrative xate, the popular foliage used for floral arrangements worldwide. Xate, which has been used for 40 years and is exported, has brought enormous economic benefits for the rural communities in the area. <ref>[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=659&ArticleID=6912&l=en&t=long unep.org], 23 February 2011</ref>
