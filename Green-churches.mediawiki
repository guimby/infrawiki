In the Bible Mark 13:30-34 reads:
: "....Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. It is as when a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch. Watch therefore: for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, whether at even, or at midnight, or at cockcrowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch."[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/mark-asv.html] [http://bible.cc/mark/13-34.htm][http://scriptures.lds.org/en/mark/13]

It may have been based on this passage that faith based enviromentalism first developed since if the earth is Christ's house then it stands to reason that he would prefer upon his return to find that it has been well kept.
