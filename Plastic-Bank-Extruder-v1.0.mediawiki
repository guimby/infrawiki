[http://plasticbank.org/ The Plastic Bank] is an organization designed to remove plastic waste from the worldâ€™s oceans, beaches and waterways while empowering people living in poverty to raise their standard of living.

To achieve this goal the Plastic Bank is releasing their first version of a [[recyclebot]]. The Plastic Bank system is an industrial waste plastic/ocean plastic extruder and have provided all of the plans as [[open hardware]].

==Operation Plastic Bank Extruder v1.0==
===Setup Procedure: Plastic Bank Extruder v1.0===

====Die Setup:====

# Ensure that the power is off, and the controls are turned off before beginning
# Check that there are no foreign objects in the extrusion barrel and ensure that all components (screw, barrel, breaker plate, die, and die adapter) are clean. If 	the barrel contains any solid objects that are not plastic flakes or 	plastic resin remove it using compressed air. Never insert a foreign 	object into the barrel at any time.
# Once the foreign objects are 	removed, place the breaker plate, in the breaker plate channel at 	the end of the barrel.
# Firmly and fully screw the die adapter onto the threading at the end of the barrel ensuring that 	there is no spacing left
# Choose your selected extrusion die, and use four (4) M6 bolts equally torqued 	to secure it in place.
# Check to ensure that all components are mounted flush and there are no debris or residual plastic on the components before beginning the extrusion process.

====Heating:====

# Once the die is in place, the extruder is ready to begin the heating sequence. It is important to set your desired temperatures before beginning this process as it 	takes time for components to heat up and cool down.
# Ensuring that the motor switch  is off, turn the extruder and control box on.
# The temperatures sensors and 	heater bands will now display temperatures. Set temperatures by pressing the arrow keys and hitting set on each of the three heating 	zone regions
# The system generally takes 45  minutes to 60 minutes to heat up. Once the extruder has reached the required melting temperature, the motor can be turned on and begin 	running.
# Take caution when working near the barrel and die as components can be extremely hot.

===OPERATION PROCEDURE===

====Preparing Input (Purging):====

# A purge material with a lower processing temperature of high melting temperature plastic (e.g. for PET <240 degrees Celsius) will be 	required such as PLA to clean and remove any residuals left behind from prior processes.
# Ensure that the input purge 	material and high melting temperature plastic  material has been properly cleaned, flaked, and 	dried before beginning. All labels and non-high melting temperature plastic  materials should be 	removed from the hopper. Ensure that flakes are no larger than 12mm 	in their largest dimension.
# Feed Fifty (50) grams of the 	purge material in the barrel ensuring proper feed and no clumping at 	the barrel inlet.
# Observe the extrudate at the 	die exit, the extrudate should be the same colour as the input 	material. Repeat the purging process until the colour matches, and 	the barrel and screw are completely clean.
# Now that the barrel has been 	purged, the high melting temperature plastic  input material can be fed. Start by feeding small quantities of one tablespoon of flakes into the barrel inlet.
# Monitor the process and ensure  that the high melting temperature plastic  is not sticking to the screw. If the feed is sticking 	to the screw, lower the zone 1 temperature until feed is consistent.
# Once the feed temperature has been set, the extrusion hopper can be filled. Monitor the levels of the hopper consistently checking that the hopper outlet is not 	jammed.

====Collecting Output:====

# It is imperative to constantly monitor the machine and ensure that the temperatures are not 	exceeding the optimum processing range.
# Observe the extrudate at the 	die exit. If there is no extrudate for 15 minutes after initial feeding of high melting temperature plastic , repurge the machine and follow the Preparing Input procedure again.
# If the extrudate is 	experiencing high levels of die swell or is liquid at the exit, decrease your ZONE 3 temperature until the extrudate is solid.
# Once the extrusion process is complete, purge the machine once again ensuring it is fully cleaned through with a low melt temp plastic.
