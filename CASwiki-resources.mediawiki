Our current list of resource articles is in the far right hand column. An example of a fairly extensively developed CASwiki resource article is [[International sustainable community events]], but of course resource articles can be started off with just a few items of relevant information.

== Share information about Resources ==

[[File:Greenheart.jpg]] Share information about all kinds of resources for community action for sustainability. 

The information in the pages featured here is about international, global or generic resources. The vast majority of the information about resources in CASwiki is location or topic specific.

=== Share information about Resources by place ===

You can view or share location specific information about resources for community action for sustainability via any of CASwiki's [[CASwiki places|location]] pages

=== Share information about Resources by topic ===

=== Guidelines for Resources articles or content ===

'''Resources for all, not just 'professionals''''

It's a feature of much material available on sustainability topics that 'Resources' are often written primarily for a 'professional' type audience (and so may contain jargon, unexplained acronyms, etc). It is hoped the CASwiki can redress the balance  a bit and include articles, for example on topics such as [[community resources]], written primarily from the point of view of ordinary concerned citizens and community groups.

== Quotes ==

"Building a world where we meet our own needs without denying future generations a healthy society is not impossible, as some would assert. The question is where societies choose to put their creative efforts." Christopher Flavin


"Go with your gut instinct.  Be innovative. Innovation is about challenge, challenging others, challenging yourself, your own perceptions. If its hasn't got a challenge in it let someone else do it - you go and do something that is unique."

Barbara Willis Brown of the [[Birmingham]] ([[UK]]) based organisation Scawdi - taken from a [[wikipedia:Podcast|podcast]] on the Grassroots Channel <ref>[http://www.podnosh.com podnosh.com]</ref>

== Social innovation ==

Social innovations are new strategies, concepts, ideas and organizations that meet the social needs of different elements which can be from working conditions and education to community development and health — they extend and strengthen civil society. Social innovation includes the social processes of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the innovations which have a social purpose — like online volunteering, microcredit, or distance learning.

Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani Akhter Hameed Khan, Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank which pioneered the concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and also inspired programs such as the Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme of Dnet (A Social Enterprise) and Stephen Goldsmith, former Indianapolis mayor who engaged the private sector in providing many city services. {{W|Social innovation}}
