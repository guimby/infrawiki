== '''Boiling Water Reactor''' ==
A boiling water reactor (BWR) is a type of [[nuclear energy]] reactor. The central part of the plant is the reactor "core" in which the uranium fuel is assembled for the generation of steam for the turbine generator. In a typical BWR, there are about 35,000 fuel rods containing about 120 tons of [[uranium]] fuel.

== '''Purposes''' ==
The water that surrounds the fuel rods in the reactor serve two purposes.
# To carry away the heat energy produced in the [[fission]] process.
# To moderate (slow down) the neutrons produced in the [[fission]] reaction.


== '''Moderator''' ==
A moderator is a substance used in nuclear reactors to slow down neutrons so they can be more readily captured by 235U and produce fission, usually water.


== '''Types of Light Water Reactors''' ==
# Boiling Water Reactors (BWR)
# Pressurized Water Reactors (PWR)

99% of commercial nuclear power in the U.S. and 80% of that in the world is produced by these two types of reactors.
