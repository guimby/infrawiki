While [[open source]] [[software]] commonly uses the [[GFL]] or similar license, text-based and multimedia content (like that found on [[Appropedia]], [[Wikipedia]], or [[open-license]]d [[blogs]]) is typically licensed under:
* A [[Creative Commons]] license: [[Open license options]] are [[Creative Commons Attribution]] (CC-BY) and [[Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike]] (CC-BY-SA). CC-BY-SA is used for [[Appropedia]] and [[Wikipedia]]. Other options exist, namely adding the [[Non-commercial]] and/or [[No derivatives]] clauses, but this is no longer considered an open or free ([[libre]]) license. 
* [[GFDL]] (GNU Free Document License): An older license from the [[GNU Foundation]], formerly used for [[Appropedia]] and [[Wikipedia]].
* Lesser known licenses such as the Free Art License.{{w|Free Art License}}
