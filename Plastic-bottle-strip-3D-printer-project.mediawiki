==Idea: Open Hardware for High Value Recycling of PET Bottles ==

Use simple 3D printable+utility blade stripper (like this [[PET_Bottle_Shredder|one]]) to turn [[PET]] bottles into strips, microweld them together and then make a 3D printer extruder/driver capable of printing with the strips automatically. This will cut down on the embodied energy of 3D printing with recycled materials even further - as you can cut out the filament forming step with the [[recyclebot]] used for normal cylindrical FFF printing.

==To do==
===Machine building===
* automate stripping and spooling (consider simple single motor assembly for doing both
* create microwelder to butt weld the end of the strip to the beginning of the next one
* create a direct drive extruder capable of printing PET that can handle PET strips
* 3D print demonstration object from bottle
----
To be really awesome
* automate end detection and isolation (See MOST Quality Control on Recyclebot)
* solar power it

===Data to collect===
* measure total mass of bottle and percent recovered in strips
* measure energy use for all steps
* measure time for all steps
