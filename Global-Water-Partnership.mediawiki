==History==
The concept for the Global Water Partnership grew out of the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Environment, the 1977 Mar del Plata Conference, the Dublin statement<ref>http://www.gdrc.org/uem/water/dublin-statement.html</ref> from the January 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),<ref>http://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html</ref> the "Protection of the Quality & Supply of Freshwater Resources: Application of Integrated Approaches to the Development, Management & Use of Water Resources" statement (Chapter 18 of Agenda 21 from the Rio Conference),<ref>http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/res_agenda21_18.shtml</ref> and general dissatisfaction with the lack of sustainability analysis in setting water policy goals and in water planning.<ref>Gleick, Peter H. (August 1998) "Water in Crisis: Paths to Sustainable Water Use" ''Ecological Applications'' 8(3):  pp. 571-579, page 572</ref>

The GWP was founded in 1996 with the support of the [[World Bank]], the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]].<ref name="Reinicke-53">Reinicke, Wolfgang H. (1999) "The Other World Wide Web: Global Public Policy Networks"
