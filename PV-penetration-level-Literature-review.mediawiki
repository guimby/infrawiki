This is a list of refs for '''PV penetration levels''' (also try solar, photovoltaic, intermittent, or distributed generation penetration/percent/)  - this refers to the maximum amount of solar photovoltaic electricity able to be provided reliably on the grid.

**NOTES: 
*** Figures of System Load with and without large PV systems on two summer and two spring days.
*** Model to analyze the impacts of large-scale PV deployment.
** CONCLUSIONS:
***'By increasing the system flexibility, it now becomes at least theoretically possible to provide 50% of the system's energy from PV - although this requires the ability to completely turn off all conventional generation for short periods of time without cost penalty.'
***'We found that increasing the flexibility of the electric power system in the simulated system could increase the contribution of PV to perhaps 20%-30%. Beyond this contribution, enabling technologies such as fuel switching in "smart" appliances, dispatchable load from plug-in hybrid or other electric vehicles, or stationary energy storage would be required to enable very high levels of PV contribution to the electric power system.'

** NOTES:
*** Figure of PV Availability during major summer 1999-2000 outages.
** CONCLUSIONS:
*** 'it would take very little in terms of back-up storage or end-use load management associated with PV to provide the equivalent of firm PV capacity up to significant load penetration levels.'

** NOTES:
*** 'we evaluate the ability of PV to provide a large fraction (up to 50%) of a utility system’s energy by comparing hourly output of a simulated large PV system to the amount of electricity actually usable.'
** CONCLUSIONS:
*** 'The limited flexibility of base load generators produces increasingly large amounts of unusable PV generation when PV provides perhaps 10–20% of a system’s energy.'

**NOTES:
***This paper discusses and analyses the impact of micro-generation (in particular, PV+CHP hybrid residential systems) on the voltage rise in a test-network in the UK.
***The authors created an unbalanced load-flow engine using Matlab, which takes modelled load and generation data and saves the calculated voltages as minute-by-minute data for all nodes across the network.
***'we considered the European Standard, EN 50160, which states that, under normal operating conditions, all ten-minute mean values shall be within the range 195.5 V to 253 V. The 50% PV and 100% CHP scenarios, already discussed, lead to voltages that exceed this range, and thus, accommodating penetrations of this order would require some adjustment or re-engineering of network voltage control systems. The next two rows of Table I (30% PV and 23% CHP, respectively) show scenarios that would be acceptable under EN 50160 without any changes to voltage control systems.' (pp.1161)
