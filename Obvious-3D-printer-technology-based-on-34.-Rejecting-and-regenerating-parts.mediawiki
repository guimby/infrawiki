#Detect part failure [[User:Swallen|Swallen]] ([[User talk:Swallen|talk]]) 07:34, 3 December 2015 (PST)
##Using vision processing to detect print failure
###'''Use a green-screen to measure the printed part outline, then compare to a render of the .stl from the same perspective to detect print failure'''
####Use two cameras from perpendicular perspectives to ensure complete failure detection
##Using a proximity sensor on the head to detect head positioning failure
##Measuring the weight of the bed to detect extrusion failure
##Using a limit switch to detect filament breaks
##'''using a gripping wheel and an encoder to detect filament jams'''
#restart print at point of failure when possible [[User:Swallen|Swallen]] ([[User talk:Swallen|talk]]) 07:34, 3 December 2015 (PST)
##Detect where the print left off so it can be restarted from that specific layer
###Use vision processing to measure height of printed part
###Guess last successful layer based on the point where a failure was detected
###Use weight of print bed to measure where the failure occured
###Use the print head to measure the part height
####Use a touch probe on the print head to measure the height of the printed surface
####'''Use a proximity sensor on the print head to measure the height of the printed surface'''
##Restart print from the exact point in the gcode where the point left off
###Find the failed layer in gcode, and start a new print starting at that layer
#Fix failed portions of a print [[User:Swallen|Swallen]] ([[User talk:Swallen|talk]]) 07:34, 3 December 2015 (PST)
##Remove excess or failed material from print
###Use a hot surface to burn away excess material;
###Use jets of hot air to burn away excess Material;
###Use a solder-sucker type device to remove failed or excess material
###use a solder tip to scrape excess material away
##Reshape failed portions of the print
###use a solder tip to physically reshape failed parts of a print
##Reprint failed portions of the print
###give the print head more degrees of freedom so it can reprint failed overhangs
