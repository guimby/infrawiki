== Beach Boys: Dont go near the water==

Don't go near the water... <br />
Don't you think it's sad, <br />
What's happened to the water? <br />
Our water's goin' bad. <br />

Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams <br />
Have all been touched by man. <br />
The poison floatin' out to sea <br />
Now threatens life on land. <br />

Don't go near the water... <br />
Ain't it sad, <br />
What's happened to the water? <br />
It's going bad. <br />

Don't go near the water; <br />
Don't go near the water... <br />

Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath, <br />
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath. <br />
Beginning with me, <br />
Beginning with you... <br />

Don't go near the water <br />
To do it any wrong; <br />
To be cool with the water <br />
Is the message of this song. <br />

Let's all help the water— <br />
Right away! <br />
Do what we can and ought to— <br />
Let's start today. <br />

==Adrian Belew: Only A Dream==

The woman screams at the windy day; <br />
Her children play in the acid rain. <br />
The water is green and the sky is brown; <br />
the cars and buildings, all broken down. 

Now what in the world is happening here? <br />
Will somebody please explain? <br />
Nothing I see makes sense to me— <br />
Maybe it's only a dream. 

The deer in the forest or the eagle in the sky, <br />
They see Man coming and they run to hide. <br />
The birds on the shore will no longer fly, <br />
they're covered in oil and they're bound to die. 

==Captain Sea Level: When the North Pole Melts ==
When the north pole starts to melt, <br />
What is gonna happen to his little elves? <br />
Will they be too busy swimming to make the toys? <br />
And what will Santa do <br />
If the North Pole melts too fast? <br />
Is this Christmas gonna be his last? <br />
What will parents have to tell their girls and boys?

==James Taylor: Traffic Jam==
Now, I used to think that I was cool, <br />
Running around on fossil fuel. <br />
Until I saw what I was doing— <br />
Was driving down the road to ruin.


==Lenny Solomon: Global Warming Blues==
He loves to go out shopping in his SUV <br />
A car that large is rocking, fits him to a tee <br />
When he gets behind the wheel, hears that engine whine <br />
He doesn’t think of the gasoline he’s burning all the time <br />
Will it be now or later, when he gets a clue <br />
Global warming’s coming, babe, it’s gunna get you <br />

I make so much money I could buy me a continent <br />
Gunna build me a trophy house with every complement <br />
A fridge as big a Venus, a stove as big as Mars <br />
With all the modern conveniences, you see I’m a star <br />
Will it be now or later, when he gets a clue <br />
Global warming’s coming, babe, it’s gunna get you <br />
<br />
Glaciers are all melting, the Arctic’s turning green <br />
Polar bears have seen their lairs go floating down the stream <br />
Harp seals have changed color, they’re no long white <br />
They’re now bronze complected and extremely uptight <br />
Will it be now or later, when we get a clue <br />
Global warming’s coming, babe, it’s gunna get you

== Jimmy Buffet: Wheather with YOU==
Song discuss how the weather is everywhere and we can not control it!
--[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 01:17, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Walking around the room singing <br />
Stormy weather at 57 Mount Pleasant Street <br />
Well its the same room but everything's different <br />
You can fight the sleep but not the dream <br />

Things aint cooking in my kitchen <br />
Strange affliction wash over me <br />
Julius Caesar and the roman empire <br />
Couldn't conquer the blue sky <br />

Well There's a small boat made of china <br />
It's Goin nowhere on the mantlepiece <br />
Do I lie like a loungeroom lizard <br />
Or do I sing like a bird released <br />

Everywhere you go <br />
You always take the weather with you <br />
Everywhere you go <br />

==Jimmy Buffet- Volcano==
Talks of the effects that nature can have!!! 
--[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 01:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Chorus:  <br />
Now I don't know  <br />
I don't know  <br />
I don't know where I'm a gonna go  <br />
When the volcano blow  <br />


Ground she's movin' under me  <br />
Got ya tidal waves out on the sea  <br />
Sulphur smoke up in the sky  <br />
Pretty soon we learn to fly  <br />

.... <br />
Now my girl quickly said to me  <br />
Man, you'd better watch your feet  <br />
That lava comes out soft and hot  <br />
You better lova me now or lova me not  <br />

.... <br />
No time to count what I'm worth  <br />
Hey I just left the planet earth  <br />
But a' where I go I hope there's rum  <br />
Not to worry, more soon come <br />
...... <br />
But I don't want to land in New York City  <br />
Don't want to land in Mexico (no no no)  <br />
Don't want to land in the Three Mile Island  <br />
Don't want to see my skin aglow (no no no)  <br />

Don't want to land in Commanche Sky park  <br />
Or in Nashville, Tennessee (no no no)  <br />
Don't want to land in no San Juan airport  <br />
Or the Yukon Territory (no no no)  <br />

Don't want to land in no San Diego  <br />
Don't want to land in no Buzzard's Bay(no no no)  <br />
Don't want to land on no ayutollah <br />
I got nothin a more to say <br />

==Jimmy Buffet: A salty Piece of LAnd==
Song just shows to have pride in the land and look to see its beauty!
--[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 01:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

I was listening for answers <br />
That I could not really hear <br />
When the words of a wise old Indian <br />
Put a conch shell to my ear <br />

And I took off for the ocean  <br />
I was searching for the coast <br />
Painting pictures of my vision <br />
With the words from grandma ghost <br />

Hiding from the dragons <br />
Riding for the sea <br />
Singing ballads from my childhood <br />
“A pirate’s life for me” <br />

Survivors seem to function best <br />
When peril is at hand <br />
With a song of the ocean <br />
Meets a salty piece of land <br />

I was force-fed my religion <br />
But I somehow saved my smile <br />
Tapped into my instincts <br />
As I headed to’ards exile <br />

Cleopatra did not own a barge <br />
But a schooner was her home <br />
She has centuries of stories <br />
And there’s wisdom in her bones <br />

She was on a sacred mission <br />
And she told me of a place <br />
Where a man can hide forever <br />
But never loose his face <br />

So I saddled up my seahorse <br />
With a fly-rod in my hand <br />
I was not looking for salvation <br />
Just a salty piece of land <br />

Somedays Cayo Loco SHIMMERS <br />
Like the stars up in the sky <br />
And the seabirds they do touch and gos <br />
As the world just tangos by <br />

But there are times when she is hidden <br />
Beneath the wild and crashing waves <br />
And the patron saint of lightening <br />
Keeps the sailors from their graves <br />

Some say it is a blinding sword <br />
Pointing out into the sea <br />
While others say her guiding light <br />
Leads to’ards eternity <br />

Still I sit in contemplation <br />
And I just don’t understand <br />
This mysterious attraction <br />
Of this salty piece of land <br />

Still I search the constellations <br />
And the tiny grains of sand <br />
Where the song of the ocean <br />
Meets the salty piece of land <br />

==Joni Mitchell: Big Yellow Taxi [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Yellow_Taxi]==
<!-- to do: fix formatting -->
''"Living in Los Angeles, smog chocked L.A., is bad enough but the last straw came when I visited Hawaii for the first time. It was night time when we got there, so I didn't get my first view of the scenery until I got up the next morning. The hotel room was quite high up so in the distance I could see the blue Pacific Ocean. I walked over to the balcony and there was the picture book scenery, palm tree swaying in the breeze and all. Then I looked down and there was this ugly concrete car park in the hotel grounds. I thought "They paved paradise and put up a parking lot" and that's how the song "Big Yellow Taxi" was born."''

==Coldplay: Politik==
[http://youtube.com/watch?v=P54iLHkrtPA Politik Video on Youtube]

Although this song may not seem to have too much to do with energy and the environment, it deals with what is important to you and using your space wisely. It also says to open your eyes to the problems in the world, one of which is the environment. Whenever I hear this song, I think of how we as people take things like the environment for granted.

--[[User:Suzann.pomraning|Suzann.pomraning]] 13:51, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Look at earth from outer space <br />
Everyone must find a place <br />
Give me time and give me space <br />
Give me real, don't give me fake <br />
Give me strength, reserve control <br />
Give me heart and give me soul <br />
Give me time, give us a kiss <br />
Tell me your own politik <br />

Open up your eyes <br />
Open up your eyes <br />
Open up your eyes <br />
Just open up your eyes <br />

Give me one, cause one is best <br />
In confusion, confidence <br />
Give me piece of mind and trust <br />
Don't forget the rest of us <br />


==Hagen: Mother Nature==
'''This band originates from Sweden. Their musical style encompassas a mix of heavy metal with bluegrass/folk undertones...The lyrics "she doesn't need us" may refer to the poor environmental practices of mankind and industry.'''
--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 17:39, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

Mother nature can comfort and lead us <br />
Can shelter and feed us <br />
But she doesn't need us <br />
Mother nature can cheat and mistreat us <br />
Destroy and defeat us <br />
'Cause she doesn't need us  <br />

Mother nature can shelter and feed us <br />
Or kill and defeat us <br />
'Cause she doesn't need us <br />
Mother nature doesn't need us <br />
Mother nature doesn't heed us <br />
Up and down and round and round we spin <br />
Like dust in the wind <br />
Up and down and round and round we spin <br />
Like dust in the wind <br />

==Dave Matthews Band: Too Much==
--Krissy Kelly 3:49, 6 September 2007

Straight in, suck up and go, <br />
Cool it, swallow, swallow <br />
Breathe deep, take it all <br />
It comes cheap <br />
Push it through the doors <br />
Because in between the lines <br />
I’m gonna pack more lines <br />
So I can get in <br />
Ooh traffic jam got more cars <br />
Than a beach got sand <br />
Suck it up, suck it up, suck it up, <br />
Fill it up until no more <br />
I’m no crazy creep, I’ve got it coming <br />
To me because I’m not satisfied <br />
The hunger keeps on growing <br />
I eat too much <br />
I drink too much <br />
I want too much <br />
Too much <br />

== Joanne Rand: Antarctica==
I choose this song because it talks about the different conditions of the environment.
--[[User:JustineMichelle|JustineMichelle]] 11:04, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Well there’s a great big hole growing over Antarctica. <br />
And there’s a great big hole growing in the heart of America. <br />
And it’s growing bigger every day. <br />
Pretty soon we’re gonna blow away, <br />
When the sky comes tumbling down someday. <br />

Well the trash is collecting in the gutters in the streets of America <br />
& the oil is collecting on the birds and the beaches of America. <br />
& the sky is filling up with smog, <br />
Makes you feel like a dying dog <br />
In the gutters in the streets in the heart of America. <br />

Well they’re drilling for oil and they’re drilling for coal, <br />
& they’re drilling the army, they’re drilling our souls, <br />
& they’re drilling big holes in the skin of the earth. <br />
Makes you wonder what this whole fucking scene is worth. <br />
I don’t know what to say. <br />
It’s getting weirder every day. <br />
Makes me want to get down on my knees and pray....... <br />

==James Taylor: Fire and Rain==

this is the only song I could think of that actually said anything about the environment! I'm not sure if this is the right genre!

[[User:GabbyAdams580|Gabby]] 14:11, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone.  <br />
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you.  <br />
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song,  <br />
I just can't remember who to send it to.  <br />
I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.  <br />
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again.  <br />

Won't you look down upon me, Jesus, You've got to help me make a stand.  <br />
You've just got to see me through another day.  <br />
My body's aching and my time is at hand and I won't make it any other way.  <br />
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.  <br />
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend, but I always thought that I'd see you again.  <br />

Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun.  <br />
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around.  <br />
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come.  <br />
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.  <br />

Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain. I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end.  <br />
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend,  <br />
but I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now.  <br />

Thought I'd see you one more time again.  <br />
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now.  <br />
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now. <br />

==John Mayer: Waiting on the World to Change==

'''[http://youtube.com/watch?v=uPOBMzMTP4U "Waiting on the World to Change" Video]'''

'''This song is about our current generation and how we cannot change the world unless we get up and do something about it.''' 

--[[User:Suzann.pomraning|Suzann.pomraning]] 13:52, 7 September 2007 (PDT)


Me and all my friends <br />
We're all misunderstood <br />
They say we stand for nothing and <br />
There's no way we ever could <br />
Now we see everything that's going wrong <br />
With the world and those who lead it <br />
We just feel like we don't have the means <br />
To rise above and beat it <br />

So we keep waiting <br />
Waiting on the world to change <br />
We keep on waiting <br />
Waiting on the world to change <br />

It's hard to beat the system <br />
When we're standing at a distance <br />
So we keep waiting <br />
Waiting on the world to change <br />

== Stele Ely: On The Clothesline ==
'''[http://XOEarth.org/Clothesline/ "On The Clothesline" mp3 & video]  ''' 

--[[User:Greentopia|Greentopia]] 15 March, 2011

baby likes fresh air and periwinkle skies,  <br />
so I dry them knickers and skirts on a clothesline, <br />
(my/yea) baby smiles on laundry day, mighty fine, <br />
cuz I hang my love on the line <br />

it takes several power plants to dry america’s clothes, <br />
polluting air, land, water close to our homes, <br />
clothes dryer monsters electric and gas, <br />
they’re a pain in the planet’s biomass <br />

baby likes pleased trees and turquoise hills, <br />
so I dry our socks and undies on the windowsill, <br />
baby hugs on laundry day, mighty fine, <br />
cuz I put my love on the twine <br />

even in the cold and snow, it’s fun to hang outside, <br />
our threads last longer and stay cuddly nice, <br />
then on rainy days, we do it inside, <br />
on hangers, chairs, drying racks, for all the life <br />

baby likes sweet streams and oceans sublime, <br />
so I dry our sheets and hankies on a clothesline, <br />
baby kisses on laundry day, mighty fine, <br />
cuz I hang our love on the line  <br />

==Jamiroquai: Emergency on Planet Earth==
'''''Listen'''http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmMoTQet_78

From the album titled, "Emergency on Planet Earth," 1993. I included this song because it speaks about consciousness of lifestyle.
--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 17:05, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

The kids need education, <br />
And the streets are never clean, <br />
I've seen, a certain disposition, prevailing in the wind, <br />
Sweet change, if anybody's listening? <br />
Emergency on planet earth. <br />
Is that life that I am witnessing, <br />
Or just another wasted birth. <br />

Now, we got emergency <br />
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth <br />
Now, we got emergency <br />
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth <br />


Think we're standing for injustice, <br />
White gets two and black gets five years, <br />
Took me quite a while to suss this, <br />
But now I know my head is cleared <br />
And a little boy in hungry land, is just a picture in the news, <br />
Won't see him in that TV advertising, 'cause it might put you off your food <br />

Now, we got emergency <br />
Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth <br />
Now, we got emergency <br />
'''Oh, we got emergency on planet Earth '''  <br />

==Biotech is Godzilla by Sepultura==
'''Another great song, "Biotech is Godzilla", by "Sepultura", featuring Jello Biafra from Dead Kennedys. This song is to me about technology rapeing nature, with no remorse or concern for the future of the planet. Take however much, by any means necessary, until there is none left, move on and repeat. It also mentions some factual information; such as Cubatao, Brazil, which is one of the most polluted areas in the world and The Rio Summit of 92'; which was a gathering in Rio de Janeiro with The United Nations to help goverments rethink economic development and to better conserve and use precious natural resouces. Great song, should be played at high volume.'''

Rio Summit 92', Street people kidnapped
Hid from view
"To save the earth"
Our rulers met
Some had other
Secret plans

No... No... No... No...

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Say what?

Strip-mine the Amazon
Of cells of life itself
Gold rush for genes is on
Natives get nothing

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is Godzilla

Mutations cooked in labs
Money-mad experiments
New food + medicine?
New germs +         s!
Like Cubatao
"World's most polluted town"
Air melts your face
Deformed children all around
Bio-technology
Ain't what's so bad
Like all technology
It's in the wrong hands

Cut-throat corporations
Don't give a damn
When lots of people die
From what they've made

Biotech
Biotech
Biotech
Is A.I.D.S.?

Stop!!!

==Steel Prophet- Environmental Revolt==
'''From the album, "The Goddess Principal," 1995. These lyrics often remind me of overpopulation and the many unsustainable practices that we use.'''

We the people of this decimated planet called earth 
For twenty years have reaped only still birth 
My veins reflecting earth's rivers 
Filled with poison life they cannot support 

People of all races on this planet know economic crash
will mean so much woe 
Corporations in states of denial scream "our system's
good pollution is not what it seems" 
But like all revolution before the throng of justice
will break down the door 
People pleading reform are just the calm before the
storm 

[Chorus]

Stand up for life of the future 
Destroy the way that's ruined us 
Bring environmental killers to trial 
End their reign with a smile 

Inventions coming onto the scene 
Their effects on health remain to be seen 
But once profit begins to flow 
Corporate vultures seize the control 

Once jobs and livelihood is on the line 
They rope you into their clutches like swine 
Revolutions gone down the drain 
Work for them you're just a pawn in their game 

Then they tell you cut back conserve 
Our way can live if our rules you observe 
But you know the whole system's decayed 
To the corporate god our leaders have prayed 

[Chorus]

So you wonder what to do 
Their elections offer no one to you 
You arm yourself to destroy them 
The thought of bloodshed leaves doubt 

[Chorus]

They endorse the death penalty but abortion is a crime

Drugs that make you happy are not to be used 
But it's okay for profit to put poison in our food 
A system for the futures death our governments the
crime--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 17:18, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

==Sepultura: Old Earth==

We gamble with life fighting tribes after tribes
Colors and races misplaced in the spaces
We're falling, we're crawling, we're crying, denying
Heavy rain shaking ground, no roots will be found
Hate from my mother, the limits of mankind
We're lying, we're dying, destroying
The earth is rotting, the earth is rotting
Rot old old earth
The earth is growing, it keeps on growing
Rot old old earth
Believing in gods and spirits that can save us
Shout to the skies and disturbing the peace
We're rioting, we're shouting, we're killing, denying
Involved in our minds but not by our own actions
Consume all the wealth, there's no hope for redemption
We're burning, we're cutting, destroying
Can you feel? Can you feel it leave!
The earth is rotting, the earth is rotting
Rot old old earth
The earth is growing, it keeps on growing
Rot old old earth--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 17:18, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

==New World Water by Mos Def==

'''This song to me is about the condition of our nations water supply and the worlds. It's by Mos Def entitled, "New World Water", off the albulm "Black on Both Sides". This is only part of the song, but I thought this part had the most to say. Enjoy!'''

Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside 
Used to be free now it cost you a fee 
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam cross the sea
Man, you gotta cook with it, bathe and clean with it (That's right)
When it's hot, summertime you fiend for it (Let em know)
You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with (That's right)
It's what they dress wounds and treat diseases with (Shout it out)
The rich and poor, black and white got need for it (That's right)
And everybody in the world can agree with this (Let em know)
Consumption promotes health and easiness (That's right)
Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin it (Shout it out)
Americans wastin it on some leisure shit (Say word?)
And other nations be desperately seekin it (Let em know)
Bacteria washing up on they beaches (Say word?)
Don't drink the water, son they can't wash they feet with it (Let em know)
Young babies in perpetual neediness (Say word?)
Epidemics hopppin up off the petri dish (Let em know)
Control centers try to play it all secretive (Say word?)
To avoid public panic and freakiness (Let em know)
There are places where TB is common as TV 
Cause foreign-based companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five
Now the world is drinkin it
Your moms, wife, and baby girl is drinkin it
Up north and down south is drinkin it
You should just have to go to your sink for it
The cash registers is goin "cha-chink!" for it
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Got the fish lookin cockeyed
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause it's all about gettin that cash (Money)

==Atmosphere==
'''Another song I have is by "Atmosphere", off the album "Seven's Travels". The song is "Shhh" and to me it's about his love from where he's from and grateful that his city doesn't have all the problems of others; pollution, overpopulation, ext. Here's a clip.'''

I wanted to make a song about where I'm from
You know? Big up my home town, my territory, my state
But, I couldn't figure out much to brag about
Prince lives here, we got 10,000 lakes
But wait, the women are beautiful, to me they are
And we're not infested with pretentious movie stars
And it hit me, Minnesota is dope
If only simply for not what we have but what we don't
It's all fair, it ain't out there, it's in there
It's in the mirror, behind the breast under the hair
Follow the dream doesn't mean leave the love
Roam if you must, but come home when you've seen enough
I love New York and Cali, but I ain't movin'
Too overpopulated saturated with humans
And I'm not big on rappers, actors, or models
If I had to dip, I'd probably skip to Chicago
None of this is to diss no one, nowhere
Like damn, I'm from Minnesota, land of the cold air
Too many mosquitoes and our fair share of egos
But like my man Sabe says, that's where my mommy stays

[Chorus:]
So if the people laugh and giggle when you tell em where you live
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you know this is where you wanna raise your kids
Say shhh, say shhh
If you're from the Midwest and it doesn't matter where
Say shhh, say shhh
If you can drink tap water and breathe the air
Say shhh, say shhh

Got trees and vegetation in the city I stay
The rent's in the mail and I can always find a parking space
The women outnumber the men two to one
Got parks and zoos and things to do with my son
The nightlife ain't all that, but that's okay
I don't need to be distracted by the devil every day
And the jobs ain't really too hard to find
In fact, you could have mine if you knew how to rhyme
This is for everyone around the planet
That wishes they were from somewhere other than where they standin'
Don't take it for granted, instead take a look around
Quit complaining and build something on that ground
Plant something on that ground, dance and sleep on that ground
Get on your hands and knees and watch the ants walk around
That ground Make a family, make magic, make a mess
Take the stress, feel your motivation and build your nest
It sucks that you think where I'm from is wack
But as long as that's enough to keep your ass from coming back
And with a smile and a hint of sarcasm, he said
"I beg your pardon but this is my secret garden"

All right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well all right
(In the land of ice and snow)
Well okay
(Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minneapolis)

[Repeat Chorus]

If the playground is clear of stems and syringes
Say shhh, say shhh
If there's only one store in your town that sells 12-inches
Say shhh, say shhh
If no one in your crew walks around with a gun
Say shhh, say shhh
And if you ain't gonna leave cause this is where you're from
Say shhh, say shhh

But we all talking at the same time
We say we want peace
but nobody wants to change thier own mind"

"And it goes on and on and on
For a thousand year
And it goes on and on and on
What language are your tears"

But nobody wants to stay and plow the fields
Everybody wants to tell thier neighbors how to live
But nobody wants to listen to how they feel"

[Chorus]<br />
We see a coming war<br />
We see a coming war

Now<br />
Can you imagine this world with no oppression?<br />
And no need to dabble in greed and transgression<br />
The solution for murder and prostitution<br />
Never glorify this pollution on television<br />
Corrupt an entire nation<br />
Explicit images<br />
Never freeing Mumia regardless of proven innocence<br />
Turning to crime and not using intelligence<br />
What makes me wonder sometimes are we in hell or<br />
Inches away from confronting the powers that be<br />
Saw in seconds what has taken some hours to see<br />
Temps is hot enough to melt a bullion<br />
More than a million people are ready<br />
For rebellion is ill<br />
Sun set to the crack of dawn<br />
If you're black or blonde<br />
Uncle Sam is robbing you blind and putting shackles 'pon<br />
The minds of your children for real son<br />
Beware this system and go to war with this institution.

[Chorus]<br />
They see a coming war<br />
They see a coming war

They expect those of us who peep to not see<br />
Medical benefits should be cheap if not free (right?)<br />
The richest people are those without morals<br />
Cuz once they get inside they tend to keep the door closed<br />
Lord knows they killing us quick and clean<br />
From baseheads to people addicted to nicotine<br />
Man-made diseases where skin cells corrode<br />
To ones where if infected you die from common colds<br />
Economical foes they pose the true threat<br />
Using your tax dollars to sell and produce death<br />
What's left?<br />
We got guns and drug trafficking<br />
Government will be backing<br />
And blaming Latin and African brothers for dirty work done<br />
The shit they do not only hurts young<br />
But it's provoking revolutionary circum<br />
Stances<br />
Slow like molasses<br />
This is a message to the masses<br />
Never ass kiss<br />

[Chorus]<br />
Emergency, emergency, evacuate the premises immediately<br />
Emergency, emergency<br />

Now<br />
Open your ear<br />
Cause slavery will appear<br />
When corporate cutthroats control your career<br />
The treats of life are toned and ain't no way the ripple fix<br />
Beware the microchip that replaces the triple six<br />
Which one?<br />
Are you a soldier who fights against fraud<br />
Or pawns in this game on this government's chess board?<br />
The signs are clearly defined<br />
It's merely your mind state<br />
Wars coming my people so stay awake

== Earth Song by Michael Jackson ==
What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores

Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaaah Aaaaaaaaah

Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
I need you
(What about us)
What about nature's worth
(ooo, ooo)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us)
What about animals
(What about it)
We've turned kingdoms to dust
(What about us)
What about elephants
(What about us)
Have we lost their trust
(What about us)
What about crying whales
(What about us)
We're ravaging the seas
(What about us)
What about forest trails
(ooo, ooo)
Burnt despite our pleas
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us)
What about the common man
(What about us)
Can't we set him free
(What about us)
What about children dying
(What about us)
Can't you hear them cry
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
(ooo, ooo)
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about babies
(What about it)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
(What about us)
What about the man
(What about us)
What about the crying man
(What about us)
What about Abraham
(What was us)
What about death again
(ooo, ooo)
Do we give a damn

"Look beneath your lid some morning,
See those things you didn't quite consume—
Your fresh garbage"

Kristen Weschler



=Indie=
==Lay Me on the Water by Gavin DeGraw, from the indie album "Gavin Live" ==
Deals with one of the MAJOR elements of the ENVIRONMENT

Thinking 'bout the water for a sign
Waiting for the moment to arise
I know that no man could ever fly
Just lay me on the water 

Colors paint great pictures in my dreams
Shining off the rust that I have seen
But I don't need to show them to the world
Just lay me on the water 

If the water is calm
I'll just float
If it's rough and high
I'll pretend that I'm a boat
Lay me on the water 

Oh candy seems to roll off of my tongue
I view all good citizens as one
But I don't feel like leading some campaign
Just lay me on the water 

If the water is calm
I'll just float
If it's rough and high
I'll pretend that I'm a boat
Lay me on the water 

Oh gentle on the wing
Where I want to be
Listen to the breeze blow
Lay me on the water 

If the water is calm
I'll just float
If it's rough and high
I'll pretend that I'm a boat
Lay me on the water
Lay me on the water
Lay me on the water
Lay me on the water
Lay me on the water 


==Nature Anthem==
this is by far one of the catchiest, most lovable nature songs on planet earth. The Band is called Grandaddy and the song is called Nature Anthem. The lyrics are as follows:

"I wanna walk up the side of the mountain, I wanna walk down the other side of the mountain
I wanna swim in the river, and lie in the sun, I wanna try to be nice to everyone"

This refrain is repeated and officially lodged in one's head for the next day or two.

=Progressive Rock=

Spirit- Nothing to Hide
You have the world at your fingertips;
No one can make it better than you.
You have the world at your fingertips,
But see what you've done
To the rain and the sun;
So many changes have all just begun
To reap...
I know you're asleep.... 
Wake Up!


'''Rush- The Trees'''
This is a cool song from the band Rush.  It could be percieved as meaning many things but in this case it could have an environmental message.

There is unrest in the forest
There is trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas

The trouble with the maples
(and they’re quite convinced they’re right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light
But the oaks can’t help their feelings
If they like the way they’re made
And they wonder why the maples
Can’t be happy in their shade? 

There is trouble in the forest
And the creatures all have fled
As the maples scream `oppression!`
And the oaks, just shake their heads

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights
’the oaks are just too greedy
We will make them give us light’
Now there’s no more oak oppression
For they passed a noble law
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet,
Axe,
And saw ...

==Bjork- Earth Intruders==

Earth Intruders

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Turmoil! Carnage!

Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
Stampede of sharpshooters
Come straight from voodoo

With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics into the soil

Shower of goodness
Coming to end the doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo

I have guided my bones
Through some voltage
And loved them still
And loved them too

Metallic carnage!
Feriocity!
Feel the speed!

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo

There is turmoil out there
Carnage! rambling!


What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth
Mudgraves! Timber!
Morbid trenches!

Here come the earth intruders
Stampede of resistance
We are the canoneers
Necessary voodoo

And the beast
With many heads
And arms rolling
Steamroller!

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Forgive this tribe!

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

== Prince: Planet Earth ==

The only thing between us now is the truth we understand
If Planet Earth was in the palm of your hand

50 years from now what will they say about us here?
Did we care for the water and the fragile atmosphere?

There are only 2 kinds of folk
And the difference they make
The ones that give
And the ones that take

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one,
That caused it all to be
Then we’ll see His kingdom come,
So shall it be written, so shall it be sung

Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?

Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now... The next one might be you

Don't go near the water...
Don't you think it's sad,
What's happened to the water?
Our water's goin' bad.

Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams
Have all been touched by man.
The poison floatin' out to sea
Now threatens life on land.

Don't go near the water...
Ain't it sad,
What's happened to the water?
It's going bad.

Don't go near the water;
Don't go near the water...

Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath,
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath.
Beginning with me,
Beginning with you...

Don't go near the water
To do it any wrong;
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song.

Let's all help the water—
Right away!
Do what we can and ought to—
Let's start today.

Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around

Sick of sorrow
I'm sick of the pain
I'm sick of hearing
Again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth

Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies

They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

And it's already gone too far
You said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt
This peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth

she's got a hand on a wheel of pain
She can talk to the mangling strangers
She can sleep in a fiery bog
Throwing troubles to the dying embers

She's alone in the new pollution
She's alone in the new pollution

She's a boat through a strip-mine ocean
Riding low on the drunken rivers
She's alone in the new pollution

Take a good hard look at yourself as the world that you live in you now destroy
Don't cry, just ask yourself why you never cared until you started to die
World on fire 
Give me one good reason to respect the laws that you obey
Step back and watch it burn as the life you live just slips away 
Manipulate the ignorant hordes into hating each other and fighting your wars
With no respect for the people who died and no assistance for the families that cry
World on fire 
You expect me to believe that you shoot and kill in the name of peace?
You fuel the hateful twisted minds of the wretched, cruel, diseased
Give me one good reason to respect the lies that you obey, step back and 
watch it burn as the life you live just slips away
Don't let it slip away 
Fill our minds with conspiracy they create the hate that we believe 
Pollute our lives with your lies and treachery, show our children who is their enemy
While you sit in your oil fields and count all the money that you f**king steel

In this farewell
There’s no blood
There’s no alibi
‘Cause I’ve drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come
And wash away
What I’ve done

I'll face myself
To cross out what i’ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what i’ve done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

For what I’ve done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I’m forgiving what I’ve done!!!

When you grab a hold of me
You tell me that I'll never be set free
I'm a parasite,
creep and crawl I step into the night.
Two pints of booze
Tell me are you a badfish too? Are you a badfish too?
Ain't got no money to spend
I know the night will never end
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef

Baby your a big blue whale
Grab the reef when all duck diving fails
I swim but wish I never learned
The water's too polluted with germs
I dive deep when it's ten feet overhead
Grab the reef underneath my bed
Ain't got no quarrels with god Ain't got no time to grow old
Lord knows I'm weak
Won't somebody get me off of this reef

Ain't got no quarrels with God Ain't got no time to grow old

==Allister: Suffocation==
'''From the album,"Before the Blackout." 2005.'''

There's something buried deep between these lines that you will never see
It's something that they don't want us to figure out
Were suffocating under all the lies and picture perfect smiles
The presidents and photographs in magazines
And no ones listening

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down

There's something wrong when television is the basis for our lives
They want us to believe in everything we see
It's getting harder now that all the innocence has passed us by
Now everybody wants to get something for free
And no ones listening

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down

And everybody wants the truth
But they're too scared to face it
They just don't accept what's happening
We just sit back and watch the world destroy itself when
We all know something's wrong

We are the lives that will decide the state of desperation
Divided by a sense of doubt
We'll fight for you
We'll break the rules
We'll write this indignation
Until it all comes crashing down
Until it all comes crashing down

A piece of chaos related phylogenetically
To every living organ system, we're siblings, don't you see?

Clear blue skies—not too much to ask for;

Will they be here when we're gone?

Clean water—not too much to hope for;
It's the basis of our lives,
And without it we are done.

Well, we can keep our eyes upon the skies
And see how the time goes by,
Or we can find our fears
Among the tears
That fall when the meadows cry, cry, cry . . .


==Donovan: Atlantis==
The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean.
So great an area of land, that from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed to the South
And the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails.
To the east, Africa was a neighbor,
Across a short strait of sea miles.

The great Egyptian age is but a remnant
Of the Atlantian culture.
The antediluvian kings colonized the world;
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from fair Atlantis.

There's poison in the sea and in the air;
But worst of all, we've learned to live without her;
We've lost the very meaning of our lives . . .
And now she's gonna die!

Once she ruled the earth with love and wisdom;
But we were much too smart to live her way;
With greed and lust we tried to rise above her;
The ignorance of man will reach an end . . .
'Cause now we're gonna die!



== Joni Mitchell: Big Yellow Taxi==
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot,
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot spot.
Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone—
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot!

They took all the trees,
Put 'em in a tree museum;
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone—
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot!

Hey farmer, farmer,
Put away the DDT now;
Give me spots on my apples,
But leave me the birds and the bees—
Please!
Don't it always seem to go,
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone—
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot!
"The Moody Blues- How Is it"
Men's mighty mine-machines digging in the ground,
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found.
Concrete caves with iron doors, bury it again,
While a starving, frightened world fills the sea with grain.


==The Pretendars: My City was Gone==
I went back to Ohio,
But my pretty countryside
Had been paved down the middle
By a government that had no pride.
The farms of Ohio
Had been replaced by shopping malls,
And Muzak filled the air
From Seneca to Cuyahoga Falls.
Said, a, o, oh way to go, Ohio...



==Richard Sinclair: Plan it earth==
Another year,
Another lap around the sun for planet earth.
To keep this rock on spinning,
Never ending, just beginnings.
For future generations' children,
Let's plan it—Earth.

Common sense and understanding
Should be found by everyone.
We should be planting trees
And helping 'third world nations' from their knees,
Little children, free and well-fed . . .
Let's plan it—Earth.

I sit at traffic lights and turn my engine off;
Unleaded fuel, 
Recycling should be the rule.
Help all those threatened, endangered creatures to survive;
Air, land and sea
Should remain poison-free.
Long may green reign.

If you plan to land
Feet first, upright, with your script complete,
Remember, too much alcohol
And self-indulgent, 'mind-expanding' practises
Just won't be useful . . .
Let's plan it—Earth;
Plan it Earth . . .
Plan it Earth . . .

== Warakurna by Midnight Oil ==
This group performs songs of overuse of resources, pollution and other social distressers. 

Diesel and dust is what we breathe;
This land don't change and we don't leave.
Some people live, some never die;
This land don't change this land must lie.
Some people leave, always return;
This land must change or land must burn.



== Earth and Sun and Moon by Midnight Oil ==
In the morning we will wake up and take to the air,
Look back at the planet—I'm glued to my chair;
Southern half is burning as we climb through the sky;
Sea birds softly falling, smoke way up high.

There's the contours of the mountains, the deserts and plains,
And a hurricane is blowing, and it turns once again.
Now there's oil spills in the water where Columbus once sailed,
And there's history
And mystery
And it's rolling away . . .

I wish you could see this great mystery—
Earth and sun and moon, 
Human tribe, thin blue line;
Earth and sun and moon,
Will survive.

Sediment is flowing from river to sea;
Now where are the mighty nations, no lines to be seen;
An axe upon the broken ground, the sigh of the trees;
And it's floating in the ether, it brings me to my knees.

Too messed up to care;
Anyone got a wing and a prayer?
In the blink of an eye—
Thank you and goodnight.

Earth and sun and moon, 
Human tribe, one thin blue line;
Earth and sun and moon,
We will survive.


The Yard birds- Shapes of things"
Now the trees are almost green,
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been?
Fall into your passing hands;
Please don't destroy these lands;
Don't make them desert sands.



==The Turtles- "Earth Anthem"==

We are but an island in an ocean;
This is our home, third from the sun.
Let it be evergreen.
To keep it ever green,
I would lay my life down.
God, keep it evergreen.


==Crosby, Stills, Nash and Ypoung: Clear Blue Skies==
'''This song to me represents the artists feelings about how the water was before man came and corupted it. Will it be as good as before we came? '''

--[[User:Melinastar22|Melinastar22]] 12:51, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

Clear blue skies—not too much to ask for;
They were here before we came;
Will they be here when we're gone?

Clean water—not too much to hope for;
It's the basis of our lives,
And without it we are done.

Well, we can keep our eyes upon the skies
And see how the time goes by,
Or we can find our fears
Among the tears
That fall when the meadows cry, cry, cry . . .

Clear ideas—much too much to think of;
We need all the help we can get,
(And I know) we need all the time that we've got;
(And I know) we need all the love we can give . . .
It will be here when we're gone (clear blue skies)
It will be here when we're gone
Clear blue skies . . .

==Lynyrd Skynyrd- All I Can Do Is Write About It==

--[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 09:29, 7 September 2007 (PDT)
Gives you a general view of how amazing nature is creating on to take a look and want to preserve what we have!!!
I am the eagle, I live in high country 
In rocky cathedrals that reach to the sky
I am the hawk and there's blood on my feathers 
But time is still turning they soon will be dry 
And all those who see me and all who believe in me 
Share in the freedom I feel when I fly
Come dance with the west wind and touch on the mountain tops 
Sail o'er the canyons and up to the stars 
And reach for the heavens and hope for the future 
And all that we can be, not just what we are

== John Denver: Rocky Mountain High==
--[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 09:36, 7 September 2007 (PDT)
Song deals with the issue of expandingh has and how people ruin the beautiful lands.
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it raining fire in the sky. 
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply. 
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado. Rocky Mountain high. 

Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still knows some fear, 
of a simple thing he can not comprehend. 
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more, 
more people, more scars upon the land.

Starin' at the boob tube, turnin' on the big knob
Tryin' to find some life in the waste land
Fin'ly found a program, gonna deal with Mary Jane
Ready for a trip into hate land
Obnoxious Joe comes on the screen
Along with his guest self-righteous Sam
And one more guy who doesn't count
His hair and clothes are too far out

While pushin' back his glasses Sam is sayin' casually
"I was elected by the masses"
And with that in mind he starts to unwind
A vicious attack on the finest of grasses

== Genesis: Land of Confussion==
'''Song has to with the effects of our actions on the world!'''


must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But i can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But i can see the fire's still alight
There burning into the night.

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see
This is a land of confusion.

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.

Ooh superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour.

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in.




This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to.

== Bush- Float==
'''Song has to deal mainly with break up but mentions how its a beautiful world/nuclear field and rain.  Then it mentions how we want to change the world.  Bush doesn't directly sing about the environment but is willing to mention the effects of our environmental situations.'''

It's a beautiful world but everyone's insane Either you swim or either you fade It's a revolution time we're sleeping at the wheel Apocalypse child in a nuclear field We want to change the world but not what holds us back I want to be for you what I've never had And all of this time I was just trying to reach you Through the rain traffic As you oat into space Your white eyes hide your face As you float in between - I am with you If you leave Fragile to the waves - vicissitudes of days When I am with you I feel a little brave

The madness and the wars the circles that we run Confusion we import look what we have become And all of this time I was just trying to reach you Through the rain traffic As you float into space Your white eyes hide your face As you float in between - I die with you If you leave - I die with you I die with you

SOng is on the WHITE ALBUM
Song can be found on the album in my basement and most likely on line! 
[[User:Kerrifes|Kerrifes]] 23:34, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse,
Always having dirt
To play around in.

Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt,
Always have clean shirts
To play around in.

In their sties, with all their backing,
They don't care what goes on around.
In their eyes, there's something lacking;
What they need's a damn good w       !

Everywhere there's lots of piggies,
Living piggy lives.
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives,
Clutching forks and knives
To eat their bacon.

== Beach Boys- Don't Go Near the Water ==
It seems we're putting a lot of stuff in the water nowadays and after hearing this song it really puts a message out there and says we should do something now and fast.  If you think about it, the Beach Boys have been known for so long and way back then they were singing about environmental issues.
--[[User:Pmthomas99|Pmthomas99]] 07:10, 5 September 2007 (PDT)

Don't go near the water...
Don't you think it's sad,
What's happened to the water?
Our water's goin' bad.

Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams
Have all been touched by man.
The poison floatin' out to sea
Now threatens life on land.

Don't go near the water...
Ain't it sad,
What's happened to the water?
It's going bad.

Don't go near the water;
Don't go near the water...

Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath,
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath.
Beginning with me,
Beginning with you...

Don't go near the water
To do it any wrong;
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song.

Let's all help the water—
Right away!
Do what we can and ought to—
Let's start today.

==Jethro Tull- Wond'ring Again==
'''From the album,"Living in the Past." Lifestyle repercussions?....'''

There's the stillness of death on a deathly unliving sea,
and the motor car magical world long since ceased to be,
when the Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree.

Incestuous ancestry's charabanc ride,
spawning new millions throws the world on its side.
Supporting their far-flung illusion, the national curse,
and those with no sandwiches please get off the bus.

The excrement bubbles,
the century's slime decays
and the brainwashing government lackeys
would have us say
it's under control and we'll soon be on our way
to a grand year for babies and quiz panel games
of the hot hungry millions you'll be sure to remain.

The natural resources are dwindling and no one grows old,
and those with no homes to go to, please dig yourself holes.

We wandered through quiet lands, felt the first breath of snow.
Searched for the last pigeon, slate grey I've been told.
Stumbled on a daffodil which she crushed in the rush, heard it sigh,
and left it to die.
At once felt remorse and were touched by the loss of our own,
held its poor broken head in her hands,
dropped soft tears in the snow,
and it's only the taking that makes you what you are.

Wond'ring aloud will a son one day be born
to share in our infancy
in the child's path we've worn.
In the aging seclusion of this earth that our birth did surprise
we'll open his eyes.

==Moody Blues- How Is It?(We are here)== 

'''From the album "A Question of Balance." Check out the lyrics...'nuff said.'''

How is it we are here, on this path we walk,
In this world of pointless fear, filled with empty talk,
Descending from the apes as scientist-priests all think,
Will they save us in the end, we're trembling on the brink.

Men's mighty mine-machines digging in the ground,
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found.
Concrete caves with iron doors, bury it again,
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain.

Her love is like a fire burning inside,
Her love is so much higher it can't be denied,
She sends us her glory, it's always been there,
Her love's all around us, it's there for you and me to share.

Men's mighty mine-machines digging in the ground,
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found.
Concrete caves with iron doors, bury it again,
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain.

How is it we are here
How is it we are here
How is it we are here

If we reason with destiny, gonna lose our touch

Rejoice They sing
They worship their own space
In a moment of love, they will die for their grace

In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail
Don't kill the whale

==Rush- Trees==

'''This song tells a story of timber harvesting and the stuggle of a forest....'''

There is unrest in the forest,
There is trouble with the trees,
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas.
 
The trouble with the maples,
(And they're quite convinced they're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light.
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made.
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade.
 
There is trouble in the forest,
And the creatures all have fled,
As the maples scream "Oppression!"
And the oaks just shake their heads
 
So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights.
"The oaks are just too greedy;
We will make them give us light."
Now there's no more oak oppression,
For they passed a noble law,
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe, and saw.

All the children dead from war 
Did you ever stop to notice

==Rick Wakeman: The Forest==

Journey on through ages gone, to the centre of the earth
Past rocks of quartz and granite, which gave mother nature birth
Burial ground of ancient man, his life no more is seen,
A journey through his time unknown, I wonder where he's been
Wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been, wonder where he's been
The shore now gone behind the hills, a forest in our sight,
Rocks and distant mountains, bathed in waves of blinding light
Forests from far gone time, no living man has seen,
A private prehistoric world, for you and I a dream
Brownish hue dicates my eye, no colour hides their fear,
Flowers faded, dull and cold, now bleached by atmosphere
Creatures twisting under trees, huge monsters soaked with rage
Hidden deep below our earth, a frightening, bygone age
Their shepherd came, now long extinct, a huge primeval man
The three men filled with disbelief, just turned as one and ran.

Every day she gets a little weaker
The beauty she once knew has come and gone
We've murdered all her sons and all her daughters
The blood is on your hands, the time has come
And now she's gonna die

There's poison in the sea and in the air
But worst of all we've learned to live without her
We've lost the very meaning of our lives
And now she's gonna die

But we were much too smart to live her way
With greed and lust we tried to rise above her
The ignorance of man will reach an end

Oh, Mother Earth,
With your fields of green
Once more laid down
by the hungry hand
How long can you
give and not receive
And feed this world
ruled by greed
And feed this world
ruled by greed.

Oh, ball of fire
In the summer sky
Your healing light,
your parade of days
Are they betrayed
by the men of power
Who hold this world
in their changing hands
They hold the world
in their changing hands.

Oh, freedom land
Can you let this go
Down to the streets
where the numbers grow
Respect Mother Earth
and her giving ways
Or trade away
our children's days
Or trade away
our children's days.

Respect Mother Earth

Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth
And when I search a faceless crowd 
A swirling mass of gray and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
In fact, they look so strange
Raise your glass to the hard working people 
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leading but get gamblers instead
Spare a thought for the stay-at-home voter 
Empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows 
And a parade of the gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio
And when I look in the faceless crowd 
A swirling mass of grays and
Black and white
They don't look real to me
Or don't they look so strange
Let's drink to the hard working people 
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people 
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the hard working people 
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the two thousand million 
Let's think of the humble of birth

=='''Melissa Etheridge- I Need To Wake Up'''==
I am including this song because she is talking about waking up and seeing what is going on around her.  She says that she is not alone and that things need to be changed.

Have I been sleeping? I’ve been so still Afraid of crumbling
Have I been careless?  Dismissing all the distant rumblings
Take me where I am supposed to be To comprehend the things that I can’t see
Cause I need to move I need to wake up I need to change I need to shake up
I need to speak out Something’s got to break up I’ve been asleep
And I need to wake up Now
And as a child I danced like it was 1999 My dreams were wild
The promise of this new world Would be mine
Now I am throwing off the carelessness of youth To listen to an inconvenient truth
That I need to move I need to wake up I need to change
I need to shake up I need to speak out Something’s got to break up
I’ve been asleep And I need to wake up Now
I am not an island I am not alone I am my intentions
Trapped here in this flesh and bone
Oh I need to move I need to wake up I need to change
I need to shake up I need to speak out Something’s got to break up I’ve been asleep And I need to wake up Now I want to change I need to shake up I need to speak out Oh, Something’s got to break up I’ve been asleep
And I need to wake up Now

’star fleet to scout ship, please give your position. over’
’i am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun. over’
’you mean it’s the earth? over.’
Positive. it is know to have some form of intelligent species. over’
’i think we should take a look.’

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silken seas
Your mysterious mountains
I wish to see closer
May I land my kinky machine

Although your world wonders me
With you majestic superior crackling hen
Your people I do not understand
So to you I wish to put and end
And you’ll never hear surf music again

==Jimi Hendrix: Crosstown Traffic==
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run 
Tire tracks all across your back 
I can see you had your fun 
But darlin' can't you see my signals turn from green to red 
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead 

You're just like crosstown traffic 
So hard to get through to you 
Crosstown traffic 
I don't need to run over you 
Crosstown traffic 
All you do is slow me down 
And I got better things on the other side of town

Summertime, time, time,
Child, the living`s easy.
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, Lord,
Cotton`s high, Lord, so high.

Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,
No, no, no, no, don`t you cry.
Don`t you cry!

One of these mornings
You`re gonna rise, rise up singing,
You`re gonna spread your wings,
Child, and take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky.

Until that morning
Honey, n-n-nothing`s going to harm you now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

==Heart- Mother Earth Blues==

Well- you can have me all the time
Or you can never come my way
But Mother Earth is waiting for you
There's a debt you've got to pay
I don't care how rich you are
I don't care what you earn
You know that when it all comes down
You've got to go back to Mother Earth
You know you may have a million dollars
Or you may drive a cadillac
You may have enough money
To buy anything, ANYTHING you lack
Well- I don't care how rich you are
I don't care what you're worth
Cuz you know when it all comes down
You've got to go back
You've got to go back to
Mother Earth
You know you shook me, Babe
You shook me all night loooooooong
You know you shook me, Baby
You shook me all night loooooooong
You shook me so hard, Baby.....--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 08:23, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

''No sun will shine in my day today
The hich yellow moon won't come out to play
I said darkness has covered my light
And the stage my day into night
Where is the love to be found
Won't someone tell me
Cause life must be somewhere to be found
Instead of concrete jungle
Where the living is harder

Concrete jungle
Man you got to do your best
No chains around my feet
But I'm not free
I know I am bound here in captivity
yeh-I've never known the happiness
I've never known what sweet caress is
Still-I'll be always laughing like a clown
Won't somebody help me 'cause
I've got to pick myself from off the ground
In this ya concrete jungle
I said what do you got for me now
Concrete jungle ah won't you let me be now''

'''From the album, "True Democracy."'''

And the struggle goes on---

Some say the earth
Will keep on turning
Dread times are near
And I'm not joking I a warning
As we continue that same old moaning
The chosen race just keep on begging yeh
And I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no

Mother's joy turn to
Pain and hollering
Weeping for their babes and sucklings
Spirits of the innocent wandering
Sufferation everlasting
But I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no

Oh Papa dem chest keeps on burning
Fist clench tight a grit dem teeth
And blood is boiling
The price is high yet they keep on paying
The little bundles of love
They are all missing
And I wanna know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no

Brothers and sisters
This plight we're facing
Get involved problems to solved
Yourselves concerning
Divided we are so
One by one we are falling
The front line of the battle is hottest
Your duties calling
I demand to know who's responsible?
They don't give a damn no

Talking down south Atlanta killings
Talking down south Deptford bombings
Talking down south Azania coming

They'll cut your hearts out
And I'm not joking
Turn no blind eye brothers be willing
Yeh the front line of the battle is hottest
Your duties calling

Global warning
Looking for love
Stand up and be counted
Never let them chop us down
Global warning
Cause you got to know — oh yes
Stand up and be counted
Don't ever let them cut us down, hey.
The storm of life has come to
Wash away my fears
In dis ya sacrifice we make a change
The preservation of the ancient forest growing
Is our common goal to re-arrange
What about the wild life
Save them from extinction
Have a sense of purpose
Putting up resistance
Destroying earth was not Jah's plan
It's the work of man


Global warning
Cause we've had enough
Stand up and be counted
Don't ever let them chop us down
Never let them
Never let them

==Bob Marley: So Much Trouble in the World==

So much trouble in the world now [repeat]
Bless my eyes this morning
JAH sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly things are going
Anything can happen

You see men sailing on their ego trips
Blast off on their spaceships
Million miles from reality
No care for you, no care for me
So much trouble in the world now [repeat]
All you've got to do is give a little
Give a little, give a little
One more time ye-a-h! ye-ah!
[ Lyrics accessible from http://www.rare-lyrics.com ]

So you think you have found the solution
But it's just another illusion
So before you check out your tide
Don't leave another cornerstone standing there behind
We have got to face the day, ooh we come what may
We the street people talking, we the people struggling

Now they are sitting on a time bomb
Now I now the time has come
What goes up must come down
Goes around comes around
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble, there is so much trouble
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble in the world--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 17:33, 4 September 2007 (PDT)

== String Cheese Incident- Black Clouds ==

Black clouds rollin’ up the valley.
Black clouds cover up the sun,
Black clouds rollin’ up the valley,
How can I be sure that you’re the one?

Rivers rushin’ through the canyons,
Rivers rollin’ through the hills,
Rivers rushin’ through the canyons,
I’ve got a restless heart I can’t keep still....

''See this path we’re on coming to a fork now,
The forest blocks the light of day
On this pathway we must make a choice now,
Stay together or go our separate ways.''

Thunder clappin’ in the treetops
Sparks shoot out in the night,
Thunder clappin’ in the treetops
It’s hard to say who’s wrong and who is right.

Fire ragin’ in the woodlands,
Smoke blows across the fields
Fire ragin’ in the woodlands,
You don’t really know the way I feel.

==Keller Williams: Thirsty in the Rain==
There's an eagle, and he keeps on flying 
Over the mountains capped in white snow 
In green valleys lonesome people trying so hard 
to tell each other what they think they know. 

With greedy hands they take each other's money 
Just to buy back this helpless place 
In this land of flowing milk and honey, 
We wander thirsty in the rain 
Thirsty in the rain 

Just like that eagle, now my soul is flying 
Over the valleys in the crimson morning sky 
And there don't seem to be no use in struggling so hard 
And there don't seem to be no reasons why

'''This song is a personal alltime favorite - it spreads messages of personal responsibility, positive actions, and positive thought. Hope you enjoy.'''



''''''Take time to give thanks''' 
'''Make time to be given''' 
'''I’m going to stop and think twice''' 
'''About the way that I'm living'''''' 


Did I say a kind word 
Am I proud of my actions 
You know a job well done 
Gives me satisfaction


Can I earn your trust 
Your love and affection 
Just one step at a time 
In the right direction 


Going to aim for the sky 
Keep my feet on the ground 
Raise my voice to the heavens 
Make a joyful sound 


Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Naaaaaaa.... 
Make a joyful sound


Can I sing for my supper 
And play for my rent 
I know it sounds funny 
But it's how my time's spent


Greet everyday with full purpose 
With passion and pride 
I’m going to follow my heart 
And have nothing to hide


A moment of insight 
I know why I'm here 
You know when the time just stops 
See it all real clear 


I’ve got to set an example 
Make some mischief and fun 
Do unto others and 
Play a fat bass run


Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Naaaaaaa.... 
Make a joyful sound I got to work hard everyday 
And give it my best 
Grab hold of fear and negativity 
And lay them to rest 


I know my time here's important 
Can I do the right thing?
Practice patience and forgiveness 
Feel the joy that they bring


Can I lay down tonight 
Without feeling regret?
I know the love that I give 
Becomes the love that I get 


Well do you hear what I'm saying 
Making sense to you? 
Well if you feel it in your heart 
Then you might want to sing too


Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Naaaaaaa.... 
Make a joyful sound


I don't want to sound preachy 
Make you feel all wrong 
Just want to write some kind lyrics 
Sing a feel good song


It's kind of hard to explain 
It is just a feeling I get 
From making music making love 
Getting both feet wet 


Well every piece to the puzzle 
Snapped tight to the groove 
I Close my eyes breathe deeply and 
Let my feet move


You know I feel a little better
Now for speaking my mind 
Good vibes in circulation and 
See who they find 


Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Naaaaaaa....
Make a joyful sound

'''This band encompasses a multitude of genres, so i listed them as a "Jam Band."  To me, this song reflects the natural and unnatural shifts of the earth....''' 

'' "Imagine standing on a mountain top in Utah
Seashells at your feet
Ravens rising everywhere
Their crying fills the air
It’s so hard to believe
That ten thousand years ago
Could it really be
Where you're standing was the sea?
She's cried out before
rising from her core
Now we're looking through that door

Is she going to Rollover?
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over could it be?
All the cities are going to be
Two Thousand feet under the sea
Rollover
Rolling over you and me

Walking through the city of Jerusalem
They said it will be washed clean
It's getting pretty dark out there
No one doesn't seem to care
Looking for my submarine
A voyage to the ocean floor
To find a city lost in lore
So many things left unseen
Don't believe
We will have the final say
Cause she will always find her way
She might roll over
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over can't you see?
can’t you see that we're going to be
Two thousand feet under the sea?
Rollover
Rolling over you and meRollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over could it be?
All these cities are going to be
Two thousand feet under the sea
Rollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over can’t you see?
Can’t you see that we’re going to be
two thousand feet under the sea?
Rollover
Rolling over you and me..." ''

Sirens are calling for someone there on there way
Which house is it gonna be

The wailing and crying comes closer still
It's on our street today

A roll of the dice fate comes a knocking
And takes one more away

For all of their careful planning
Never thought it could end this way

I just want to say I love you
And make sure you feel it everyday
'Cause if today had been my last chance
It's just something I wanted to say

But this is not my time to go
Grace has brought us another day
But if tomorrow were to bring my turn
What would I have left unsaid?
What would I have left undone?
What would I have left behind?

'''This song speak abunt an actual event that occured in the Rockies of Colorado- Cheese's hometown. Unseasonal warming melted the surronding snow-capped mountains and flooded their town... read on....'''

Chorus: 
The water's rising and the rain's still coming down 
There's a river five feet deep running down main street 
Grab your children and head for higher ground 
'Cause the dam's broke loose 
And the flood's gonna wash away this town 

In the winter of '96 
Too much snow, too much rain would mix 
And when that winter day turned warm 
many a town will come to harm 

And out on Chasebrook Road that night 
That's where some people lost their lives 
One hundred feet wide and fifty feet deep Was a hole where the road used to be 
Chorus 

Come hell or high water 
Starts meaning a whole lot more 
From Walton to Schoharie County 
No one knew how bad it would be 

Some got out and walked away 
There's other missing to this day 
Scraps of [[clothing]] and paper 
Float across the water where they once were

==String Cheese Incident- Little Hands==
Winding down the dusty trail
from Cathedral Butte
Walking towards the canyon floor
playing Anasasi flutes.
Eagles flying overhead
beneath the desert sky.
Makes me think of how they lived
many years gone by.

I wander here from time to time
to give my head some space.
Leave the noise and confusion.
Vanish without a trace.
Salt Creek runs through the grass
as you hum that canyon tune.
Brush against the desert sage
just like some sweet perfume

Eight hundred years ago
this canyon was their home.
Eight hundred years ago
they walked through the sand.
Eight hundred years ago
they painted these little hands.

Yes this is the timeless place
that’s seen them come and go.
They packed it up way back when
and drifted on down the road.
The earth, the sun, the moon and the stars.
meant so much back then.
But the years go by and though you try
you can’t bring them back again.

==String Cheese Incident: Turn This Around==

Used to think we'd get to where we've been 
Now we stand here just rememberin' 
Times I wake up we knew where we've been 
Now we sit here rememberin' 


ALTERNATE: 
Used to think we could do anything 
Now I sit here just remembering 
Sometimes we thought we knew everything 
Now I sit here 


I don't think you ever thought about how much I really care 
You just live/or/float though your life with your head up in the air 
Don't you bother trying to run away 
It's all bound to catch up with you some day 
If you think you'll never go it's time to go away 


CHORUS 


See if we can turn this around, maybe some other way 
(Turn this around) 
Take this to a higher ground, maybe some other day 
(Turn this around) 
Maybe you're afraid to see, baby you're enough for me 
(Turn this around) 
Maybe you're afraid to try, you always sit there asking why 


What's the warning all is fair 
Do you think it might end some day 
Look around you're not smilin' 
All I see are just tears a cryin' 


CHORUS 


BRIDGE 


Crawl through the dark to look into the light 
You can't hide from your shadow so take a look at it right 
Don't you bother tryin' to run away if you can't stand through 
the rain 
You can't find any fun if you can't get through the pain

Dark star crashes, pouring its light into ashes.
Reason tatters, the forces tear loose from the axis.
Searchlight casting for faults in the clouds of delusion.
Shall we go, you and I while we can

Glass hand dissolving to ice petal flowers revolving.
Lady in velvet recedes in the nights of good-bye.

==Grateful Dead: Let It Grow==

Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore,
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the mornings door.
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea.

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutters daughter,
Shes brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water, and
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her.

Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear.

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field,
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal,
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring,
Black dirt live again!
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing,
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield.

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name,
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
Water bright as the sky from which it came,
And the name is on the earth that takes it in.
We will not speak but stand inside the rain,
And listen to the thunder shouting I am! I am! I am! I am.

Nothin more, the love of the women, work of men.
Seasons round, creatures great and small, up and down as we rise and fall.--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 05:01, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Grateful Dead: Eyes of the World==

Right outside this lazy summer home
You aint got time to call your soul a critic no.
Right outside the lazy gate of winters summer home,
Wondrin where the nut-thatch winters,
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away.

'''Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the mornin brings,
But the heart has its seasons, its evenins and songs of its own.'''

There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away,
And there follows his wagon behind him thats loaded with clay.
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay,
And night comes so quiet, its close on the heels of the day.

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the mornin brings,
But the heart has its seasons, its evenins and songs of its own.

Sometimes we live no particular way but our own,
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home,
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone,
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.

Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world,
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.

Gazing at the fire, burning by the water
Before he speaks the world around us quiets.

With eyes as sharp as arrows and turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather.

Many in a circle slowly round the fire
When he is gone I want to know him better.

No one is forsaken, no one is a liar,
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water.

He hums, there are drums, four winds, rising suns,
We are singing and playing, I her him saying.

Keep me high, like I told you, Ill sing to them this story and know why.--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 05:01, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

This is the season of what
Now is the time of returning
With thought jewels polished and gleaming

Now is the time past believing
The child has relinquished the reign
Now is the test of the boomerang
Tossed in the night of redeeming


Eight sided whispering hallelujah hatrack
Seven faced marble eye transitory dream doll
six proud walkers on jinglebell rainbow
Five men writing in fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls wait in a foreign dominion
Ride in the whale belly
Fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters

== Grateful Dead: Just a Box of Rain==

Look out of any window
any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
birds are winging or
rain is falling from a heavy sky -
What do you want me to do,
to do for you to see you through?
this is all a dream we dreamed 
one afternoon long ago 
Walk out of any doorway
feel your way, feel your way
like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
around some corner
where it's been waiting to meet you -
What do you want me to do,
to watch for you while you're sleeping?
Well please don't be surprised
when you find me dreaming too

Look into any eyes
you find by you, you can see 
clear through to another day
I know it's been seen before 
through other eyes on other days 
while going home --
What do you want me to do,
to do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed 
one afternoon long ago

Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams
to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted
with words half spoken 
and thoughts unclear
What do you want me to do
to do for you to see you through
A box of rain will ease the pain 
and love will see you through

Just a box of rain -
wind and water -
Believe it if you need it,
if you don't just pass it on
Sun and shower -
Wind and rain -
in and out the window
like a moth before a flame

It's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
or leave it if you dare
But it's just a box of rain
or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone 
and a short time to be there

==Phish: Lizards==
'''Part of the Phish's thesis project. This may be a stretch, but this song often reminds me of endangered species...ie, the lizards...'''


He said there was a place where we should go

So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which

We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring

The knight grew very quiet as we stood there

Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing


He said I come from the land of darkness

I said I come from the land of doom

He said I come from the land of Gamehendge

From the land of the big baboon

But I'm never never going back there

And I couldn't if I tried

'Cause I come from the land of Lizards

And the Lizards they have died

And the Lizards they have died

And the Lizards they have died

And the Lizards they have...


He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct

From doing things smart people don't do

He said that he was once a Lizard too...

His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save


His people from the fate that lay before them.

Their clumsy end was perilously near

The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened

By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book

In all of Prussia only one existed

And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook


chorus


The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets

Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor

The trick was to surrender to the flow

We walked along beneath the moon

He lead us through the bush 'till soon

We saw before our eyes a raging river

He said that we could swim it if we tried

And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms

Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk

And as his body disappeared before me

I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- Dirt ==

I'd like to live beneath the dirt
A tiny space to move and breathe is all that I would ever need
I want live beneath the dirt
where I am free from push and shove like all those swarming up above
beneath your heals I'll spend my time
I'll wiggle in the earth and dew
and somtimes I will think of you

And if you ever think of me
Kneel down and kiss the earth
and show me what this thought is worth

==Phish- Water in the Sky==
'''Reminds me of acid rain sometimes...'''

Listen as she speaks to you
Hear the voices flutter through
The barriers arranged by you

Close the shudders draw the shades
Filter out the everglades
Glistening with evening dew

Thunder calls through waterfalls
Rising tides and ocean walls
I can hear you when you sigh

Listen as she speaks to you
Hear the voices flutter through
Watch them fall and let them lie

I can hear you when you sigh
Through the water in the sky--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- A Song I Heard the Ocean Sing==
A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide
And both they soothed me in my sleep
For every season that has passed I prayed a prayer into the tide
A shining light in darkness deep
In me ten years before the mast
For every season that has passed I laid my body o'er the side
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide
How can I answer questions I've known?
A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
Ten years before the mast
I heard the ocean sing--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish: Crowd Control==
Listen now I'm talking
I've been for weeks
Waiting in this growing crowd
Staring at my feet
The world around mes turning
I'm just standing still
The time has come for changes
Do something or I will
I'm a feather in a storm
I'm a raindrop in the sea
If I dont get enough of you
I'm a lighter shade of me
Sisters, brothers all around you
There's a devil in the crowd
Meet his eye and it's the end of time
If you're praying don't be loud
It's crowded in the lowlands
But the fools stay on the hill
You control us now
You have the reins
Do something or we will
So show us why we came here
Before we lay on the ground
Give it to us loud and clear
Make the devil turn around
'''The world around me's turning'''
'''I'm just standing still'''
'''The time has come for changes'''
'''Do something or I will'''
It's crowded in the lowlands
But the fools stay on the hill
You control us now
You have the reins
Do something or we will
So show us why we came here
Before we lay on the ground
Give it to us loud and clear
Make the devil turn around
The world around me's turning
I'm just standing still
The time has come for changes
Do something or I will
The time has come for changes
do something or I will

==Phish: Theme from the Bottom==
''''''I feed from the bottom, you feed from the top'''
'''I live upon morsels you happen to drop'''
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup
If nothing comes down then Im forced to swim up
On the way upwards, the colors come back
But all along the bottom is blue, grey, and black
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong
And the night seems to go on incredibly long'''

So I ask you why if Im swimming by,
Dont you see anything youd like to try? 

Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth
Jumbled events that have less than no worth
Time in the forest to dig under rocks
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box

Or sink just below all the churning and froth
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth
So toss away stuff you dont need in the end
But keep whats important and know whos your friend

So I ask you why if Im swimming by,
Dont you see anything that youd like to try? 

If Im swimming by

From the bottom, from the top ( x 8 )--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish: Down with Disease==

Down with disease
Three weeks in my bed
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head

Down with disease
Up before the dawn
A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn, and i keep

Waiting for the time when i can finally say
That this has all been wonderful but now i'm on my way
But when i think it's time to leave it all behind
I try to find a way but there's nothing i can say to make it stop

Down with disease and the jungles in my mind
They're climbing up my waterfalls and swingin' on my vines
So i try to hear the music but i'm always losing time
'cause they're stepping on my rhythm and they're stealin' all my lines
Stealin' all my lines and i keep

Waiting for the time when i can finally say
That this has all been wonderful but now i'm on my way
But when i think it's time to leave it all behind
I try to find a way but there's nothing i can say to make it stop--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish: End of Season==
A silent bird / a raging tide a mountainside
An open door / looming from the surf
A whispered word / a steady wind as we began
And then no more / to close in on the earth--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- Fikus==
Fikus dreamed a dream for me
It cost me nothing it was free
He dreamed of walking in the sand
Of blossoms forming in his hand

Of kitchen cake and cedar shakes
Of waterfalls and yellow snakes
Of earthen dams and hydrofoils
Of watching water til it boils

Of holding forth from singing words
Of flying south with flocks of birds
None of this was charged to me
For as I said it was for free--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- Mist==
Several times unconsciously, I've stumbled on the path
And seen a mountain in the mist
As rain falls on my shoulders, sun rises in the east
A morning bruise, but I am here at least
I guess I'm just an obstacle, a thing to overcome
If I could sneak around myself, again I'll know I've won
The moment seems to hang and float, before me with no end
Till I'm released, awaken beasts, I'm on the road again
But now I'm soaring far too high, a fleck of dust up in the sky
Where tiny clouds go sailing by
Pull me down today
Woven in the fairy tales, we fabricate each day
Are little golden strands of truth, that glimmer in the light
The colorful material, you hold a certain way
Can keep up from the cold
And help to get us through the night
But now I'm soaring far too high, a fleck of dust up in the sky
Where tiny clouds go sailing by--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- Pebbles & Marbles==
'''A more recent release, from the album, "Round Room." Reminiscent of the the earth, its shores, and appreciation.'''

The faint light that flutters at night to the Earth
Would land in her eyes and collect
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf
I never thought to inspect
 
Pebbles and marbles, like things on my mind
Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone, I am inclined
If I find a pebble in the sand
To think that it fell from my hand
 
She gave me ideas, planted the seed
But she never stopped to reflect
The course that she's on, wherever it leads
I never would redirect
 
Pebbles and marbles, like words from a friend
Make us hold tight, but are lost in the end
When we're alone, we all seem to tend
If we find a marble in the dust
To wish someone left it for us
 
Pebbles and marbles, like things on my mind
Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone, I am inclined
If I find a pebble in the sand
To wish that it fell from my hand
 
Pebbles and marbles, like things on my mind...--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish: The Horse==
Its time I sling the baskets off this overburdened horse
Sink my toes into the ground and set a different course
Cause if I were here and you were there
Id meet you in between
And not until my dying day, confess what I have seen.--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish- Walls of the Cave==
'''Again, from the album, "Round Room.''What we leave behind...'''

I'm leaving you a message,
I'm leaving you a trace,
I'm leaving thoughts for you 
I hope that time will not erase.
And when the moment comes 
To read the words that I engraved,
You'll find them on the walls of the cave,
Of the cave.
I know you heard the question
But you didn't make a sound,
And when it fell you caught my heart
Before it hit the ground.
But if you ever need the names
Of those you couldn't save,
You'll find them on the walls of the cave.
You'll find them on the walls of the cave.
Look at me and time stands still
A mountain here is now a hill.
Look away,
Look away,
The time goes past.
These rocks will fall away at last.
Look away.
Maybe you will see it 
As you're passing by alone,
Below the moss forgotten
where some words that turned to stone.
It might have been an etching 
On a marker of a grave,
Or maybe on the walls of the cave.
Listen to
The silent trees
But still your words float on the breeze
Look away
I see them all
Carved into the cavern wall--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)

==Phish: Waves==
'''Sometimes i like to listen to this when i write petitions...maybe you'll enjoy it as well.'''

How is it I never see
The waves that bring me her words to me
for though unseen they drift around
they catch my breath and knock me down
I feel them quickly swirling by
As they withdraw with my reply
And slip into the dark of night
As I attemt to stay upright
Instead I'm stranded on my knees
As words depart upon the breeze
That quickly drifts away from here
And possibly won't reach her ear
If we could see the many waves
that flow through clouds and sunken caves
She'd sense at least the words that sought her
on the winds of the underwater--[[User:Hoffster|Hoffster]] 07:13, 7 September 2007 (PDT)
