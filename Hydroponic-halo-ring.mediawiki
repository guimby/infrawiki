==Abstract==

In today's day and age, both hobbyist and survival horticultural practices are been becoming more of a nor within our culture. As the amount of people entering the hobby increase, there is a growing demand for better and cheaper gardening products. I have also joined in on this new growing hobby and have personally found that commercial horticultural equipment is expensive to purchase; so to combat this, I have embarked on creating a line of 3-D printable hydroponic/agricultural products (all open source of course). The first item that I have created is called a "Hydro halo drip ring", and is used to evenly water plants from a central location using a timer and a water pump.

# Picture of completed print will be provided later.

== Bill of Materials==

#3-D Printing filament (i.e. PLA, ABS, etc.) <= That is the only material you need to print this part!
#SCAD/STL file of the hydro drip ring


Scad and STL files available here
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:577334/#files

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
Nothing more than basic 3D printing and altering well commented variables to get desired size required

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==

I used Openscad for the model, Cura for the slicer, and Repetier-Host to print the part.

#Open the .SCAD file  in Openscad, and adjust the given parameters to fit your needs. All units are in millimeters{{clear}}. Note: The hydroponic halo is currently set with a 6" diameter and can handle a 1/2 inner diameter hose connection.

Approximate print time (assuming original model is left un-altered) estimate
#3 hours 20 minutes

== Cost savings==

# My design used $3.13 in plastic at $25/Kg (i.e. 125 grams of polymer were used to print this)
# [http://www.midwesthydroponics.com/6-hydro-halo-water-ring.html|A Commercial Hydro halo like this will cost around 11 dollars]
# The total estimated savings are therefore approximately 71.54%!
