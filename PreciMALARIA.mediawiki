==Problem being addressed==
It is estimated that there are 300-500 million cases of malaria   each year.  Hence, there is a need for rapid and effective diagnosis to prevent fatalities.
==Detailed description of the solution==
The preci MALARIA P.f/P.v Rapid Test is able to detect the presence of the malarial parasite antigen, LDH.  A small blood sample is placed on a test strip, and if the antigen is present a pink/purple line will appear at a specific location on the strip after 15 minutes.  The test can also discriminate between P.falciparum and P.vivax.
