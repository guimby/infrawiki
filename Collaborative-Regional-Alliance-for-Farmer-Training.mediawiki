A '''Collaborative Regional Alliance for Farmer Training''' ('''CRAFT''') is a regionally-based organization designed to bring together experienced and beginning/aspiring farmers. Training opportunities may include workshops, apprenticeships, farm tours, and communication systems like email lists. The first CRAFT was started in upstate [[New York State|New York]] in 1994-1995, and now there are several CRAFTs around North America. CRAFTs often focus on [[sustainable agriculture]].
