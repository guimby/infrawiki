A '''polyculture''' is any horticultural or agricultural system which includes two or more kinds of organisms in close proximity. Polyculture is distinguished from [[monoculture]], which concentrates on one organism in concentration and separate from other crops or livestock. Different types of polyculture include:

* [[intercropping]] - planting of different crops in close proximity (with or without reference to their potential ecological relationships)
* [[companion planting]] - focuses on a few interactions of a few plants
* [[agroforestry]] - intercropping systems which include [[tree]]s and/or [[shrub]]s
* [[aquaponics]] - a type of [[aquaculture]] that includes the interaction of aquatic organisms and non-aquatic plants
* [[guild|permaculture guild]] - designed in reference to a complex set of organisms and their relationships

Any particular polyculture system may fall into one or more of these types.
