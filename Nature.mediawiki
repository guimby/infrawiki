'''Nature''' is a broad term to describe the physical world around us and the the universe beyond our Earth. It is not a term of art and varies in meaning depending on the discipline using it and the context in which it is used. While nature was once referred to as the areas of the world untouched by human beings, uncultivated or undomesticated, very little of the world can have such a blanket use of the term nature applied to it and in doing so, we risk distancing ourselves too much from the reality that nature is everywhere, even within the concrete buildings and paved streets of a highly developed urban environment.

Nature is a series of integrated, overlapping and intertwined ecosystems and biological systems. It may also refer to the geological and atmospheric systems acting upon and sustaining the ecosystems.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature</ref>
