| [[File:Plastic_Bottle_Garden.JPG|thumb]] 
| These bottles were used as vegetable gardens in a house in the neighborhood of La Yuca.  The abundance of plastic bottles necessitates creative ways to recycle the bottles so they don’t end up in land fills.  By using the plastic bottles families are able to grow vegetables in their house in a limited amount of space and without having to use a large amount of resources.

Este es un ejemplo de tecnología apropriada porque hay camaradería en la comunidad.  Y para tener la poder para comprar solo que necesita para las comidas que no van a pudrirse fácilmente después de cortaron.  También hay sostenibilidad porque puede salvar el resto de una fruta o verdura para el resto de la comunidad.

| [[File:AT_DripIrrigation.png|thumb]]  
| Drip irrigation is a more appropriate method of watering ornamental plants, such as this lawn area. The slow application of water reduces water usage, as well as soil erosion and nutrient loss. The use of the drip irrigation also allows water to go directly to the roots and minimizes the chance of the water evaporating before reaching the roots. This is especially important in Santo Domingo because the heat causes evaporation very quickly.

| [[File:AquaponicsCabarete.png|thumb]]
| An aquaculture system was built in Caberete. Aquaculture is a system that grows fish and plants simultaneously. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, and the plants filter the water for the fish. Both the fish and plants can be harvested for food.

| Instead of having the dead and fallen palm tree branch become debris on the side of the road, this citizen/worker is using the natural agriculture as a tool for sweeping the boardwalk from trash and debris. If this citizen is getting paid, then it provides income while also enhancing the atmosphere of a largely touristy part of Santo Domingo, encouraging tourists to come and spend money and boost the local economy.

| [[File:UNIBERooftopGarden.jpeg|thumb]]
| Food security is something that many communities have issues with. Rooftop gardens address this issue by making a surface into a multipurpose area that addresses multiple issues at once. This Rooftop Garden was built on the roof of the parking structure at La Universidad Iberoamericana. This location allows the plants to get direct sunlight as well as rain water during irregular showers. It hosts a shade structure for visitors which is appropriate in the constant high heat of the area in addition to a stand for working on when planting new food products. Each garden bed is slightly slanted in order to encourage water drainage to avoid standing water which can encourage growth of unwanted organisms in anaerobic settings and can rot the roots of plants. Drainage can occur through a small drainage pipe from each bed.

| [[image:Palacio de los Deportes Virgilio Travieso Soto.jpg|thumb]]
| Palacio de los Deportes Virgilio Travieso Soto was built for the XII Central American and Caribbean Games in 1974. “The Sports Palace is a cultural, sports and artistic space, where major sporting events are held and leading figures from the world of music are presented” <ref>http://www.conectate.com.do/eventos/palacio-deportes-santo-domingo/</ref>. This is appropriate technology because the dome creates an insulated space where the athletes can play and there are other performances that do take place, such as concerts and pageants. The dome shape has a high volume to surface area ratio as opposed to a rectangular structure. It also enhances acoustics by projecting voices therefore creating the use of less energy through sound equipment. The view from the pedestrian bridge allows speculation and communal interests of the La Media Naranja. A downfall of this technology is that the entirety of space is not utilized. While it is spacious inside, the higher ceiling due to the dome shape is not necessary in a gymnasium therefore more materials were used.

|[[image:AT_Building.jpg|thumb]]
|The reflective glass windows on this building allow natural light into the building without exposing the interior to the outside world, reducing the need for artificial lighting. This type of window also cuts down on glare, which lessens the need for blinds or other window shades. Because some of the incoming solar radiation is reflected, less heat is entering the building through the windows. This keeps the building cooler, reducing the need for air conditioning.

|[[File:RainwaterDrain.png|thumb]]
|White roofs and walls reflect more heat than darker colored roofs, which keeps the house cooler and lessening the need to use energy spending cooling devices like fans. A rainwater drain extends across the sidewalk so the water bypasses the concrete and goes straight to the soil.

|-
|[[image:StreetHoleCovering.jpeg|thumb]]
| The streets of Santo Domingo are riddled with holes from tree root invasion, earth quakes, and other city wear and tear. The city often covers these holes with rubble from old construction projects (in this case, concrete with rebar) in order to keep people from falling into the holes. This demonstrates appropriateness because it utilizes locally available resources, reduces waste, and provides solutions to everyday issues in an affordable manner.

|[[image:Agora Mall.jpg|thumb]]
| Agora Mall is the most popular mall in Santo Domingo at the moment. It consists of a "Green Methodology" where they've implemented recycling bins, automated sinks and other appropriate technology systems. Their most prominent one is in their architecture. Their design implements an enormous sky light, allowing light to come in during the day light, limiting the use of indoor lighting. It perfectly lights their "court yard", right in the center of the mall.

| [[File:Multi_Purpose_Canopy.jpeg|thumb]]
| This was an uncovered balcony on the top floor of an apartment building in Gazcue. The owners decided to created a shaded area by using tightly woven netting. The netting goes along the sides that offers protection Mosquitos or any other bug. Because it is a netting it still provides shade with minimal sun and rain coming through. Since some rain and sun can make it through the fabric, it allows the plants to grow and be watered to maintain health. This multipurpose design is simple, cost efficient and great way to find a second use for something.

| [[File:Aesthetic Plant Median.jpg|thumb]]
| The bright colored plants create an aesthetically pleasing median that provides a safe zone for vendors and pedestrians.  The median is a form of appropriate technology because it promotes walking and less car use, while at the same time providing a place for nature to thrive in the midst of a busy city.  The median is also appropriate because it directs traffic flow.  The creators of the median utilized nature instead of going against it by creating yet another concrete median.  The downfall to this plant median is that if the plants were too tall and dense, drivers would not be able to look before they merged into traffic.

| Passive Cooling of a house without the use of electricity. Using a renewable resource (tree), and intelligent design strategies, the windows of the room are protected against direct sunshine, and thus heat. ''Enfriamiento pasivo de una casa sin el uso de electricidad. Usando un recurso renovable (árbol), y estrategias de diseño inteligentes, las ventanas de la habitación se protegen de la luz solar directa, y por ende del calor.''

|-
| [[File:GreenRoof.jpg|thumb]]
| The city of Santo Domingo has taken advantage of green landscaping and reflective “light-colored” building paints in order to reduce the heat sink caused by concrete buildings. By utilizing standing water, the area becomes insulated since water has a higher heat capacity than the earth. Trees and shrubs are used not only for shade, but also retain a large amount of water to insulate the city further. Many of the city’s buildings are painted white or a light-color. This reflects the energy of the sun away from the buildings so that the concrete or structural material will not absorb additional heat. These factors contribute to a cooler city during the mid-day heat with very little additional expenditures for maintenance when compared to conventional methods.

| [[File:MaximaGomezTrees.jpg|thumb]]
| This is a photo of palm trees lining the street near Av. Maximo Gomez and Av. 27 de Febrero in Santo Domingo. Planting trees near roadways in cities helps improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and CO2. Trees and other plants also help people connect with nature in an urban environment. ''Ese es un foto de algunos arbustos en una de las aceras de la av. Maximo Gomez casi esquina 27 de Febrero, en Santo Domingo. Plantar arboles en las avenidas y calles de las ciudades ayuda a contrarestar la contaminacion ya que absorben contaminantes y CO2. Ademas de esto, los arboles ayudan a las personas a conectarse con la naturaleza en un ambiente urbano.''

| [[File:Planter Boxes.JPG|thumb]]
| Where the earth is covered by concrete people have created places to grow plants.  These planter boxes sit on top of a wall, and are created from different objects: from water jugs cut in half to buckets to rusted metal containers.  Using items that can be found, these people have created a place to grow medicinal plants, increase carbon sequestration, and enhance quality of life through the presence of nature.

| [[File:Traffic_Vendor.JPG|thumb]]
| Vendors stand in the street of Expreso 27 selling cellphones, chargers, and other small goods to commuters as they are stopped in traffic. Rather than, every day, hundreds of people adding more miles to their commute to buy certain goods, only a few vendors travel out to Expreso 27 and bring the good to the consumer. This helps reduce aggregate carbon emissions, and probably helps cut down on traffic as well

|[[File:outdoorgym.jpg|thumb]]
| This is a free outdoor gym that offers free Zumba classes. The gym is designed so that the user incorporates his/her own body weight into the routine. For example, instead of pulling weights down to work out your shoulders you pull yourself up. Why have an outdoor gym if you're basically using your own weight in the first place? The outdoor gym targets certain muscles without stressing other joints which is beneficial when working out. Playa guibia is a lively beach where many locals go to work out and hang out.

| These workers are provided by the government to sweep and pick up trash along the Av. George Washington in Santo Domingo. This provides jobs to citizens while keeping the streets of the city free from trash and debris. Av. George Washington is a large tourist area and is the backdrop for many high end hotels and casinos, so keeping it clean encourages tourists to come and spend money and boost the economy, and encourages them to return.

|In Santo Domingo, carros públicos are a common and cheap source of public transportation. The beat-up old cars that typically contain 2 seat belts in front and 3 in the back are utilized to squeeze 1 chauffeur plus 2 passengers in front, and 4 passengers in back. These cars, painted yellow or green on top, zip up and down one route, picking up and dropping off passengers along the way. They are different than taxis because they do not take passengers to their exact location and only cost 25 pesos (39 pesos to 1 US dollar). A person may need to take more than one carro público to reach their destination, typically with some walking involved. When we got into this carro público in La Zona Colonial, el chauffeur put a piece of cardboard over the windshield to keep us cool without using the air conditioner, while he waited in hope of 2 more passengers to maximize the capacity of the car.  l

|Another common form of public transport in Santo Domingo is the Guagua, or bus. Guaguas vary in size from large vans to large busses. Usually a person will be calling out the door or window of the bus to let potential riders know the bus route and to encourage them to hop aboard. Guaguas help to keep the amount of personal driving down by providing an alternative form of cheap transportation (riding a Guagua generally costs anywhere from 25 pesos to 50 pesos - up to slightly over $1 US). Guaguas will take as many people as the bus can hold, sometimes there is only barely standing room.

| This is an example of practical conservation of water while showering. It is quite common to see this type of appropriate technology is use in the Dominican Republic as water pressure intermittently decreases during the evening. A individual shower, using an average shower head, may use as much as 25-50 Gallons of water in 15-20 minutes, while the bucket method consumes only about 1-2 Gallons per use. This means by using the bucket method, an American family of four can save $140-280 per year on water utility bills when figuring the average cost per gallon of water is ~$0.004.
