==Abstract==
<center>''Short abstract describing the project from background to conclusion''</center>

==Background==
Describe the background of the project. Make sure to cover who, what, why, when and where…

==Problem statement==
Start your project objective statement in the format, "The objective of this project is to..." 

===Criteria===
Include a brief intro to the criteria and then include a table with constraints and weights (0-10 highest). Feel free to use the code from examples, such as [[CCAT pedal powered TV#Evaluation Criteria]].

Grading Criteria for previous sections:
* Formatting (should look good, sortable table for criteria) +2
* Thoroughness of content (who, what, when, were, etc.) +4

== Literature Review ==
Introduce the literature review briefly and then use heading and subheadings for topics.  This should focus on information… NO PLAGIARISM! <ref>http://www.humboldt.edu/learning/handouts/plagiarism_guide.pdf</ref> Copy and paste from this [[Practivistas Dominicana/literature review template]].

Grading criteria for Literature Review:

* Credibility (at least 1 book, 1 peer reviewed journal article, and many credible web references per student) +3
* Thoroughness and relevance (at least 3 very project relevant topics per student) +3
** Remember engineering 215 students must use technical writing
* Extra (e.g. amazing sources, beautiful writing, above and beyond topic coverage, etc.) +1

==Construction==
Very complete description of how final project is made. This large section should have lots of pictures. Please consider making a timeline in addition or instead. Use the [[Help:Images#Galleries]] and probably [[Template:How_to]] (e.g. [[Barrel O' Fun Worm Bin Instructions]]). 

===Timeline===

* Mathematical accuracy +3
* Extra (sortable, etc) +1

== Operation ==
This is how to operate. It should have a brief introduction and very useful images with labels. Also it may work best for your project to use the step by step how to template {{Tl|How to}}. See [[#Troubleshooting]] for an example.

This is how to use and maintain it. The step by step how to template {{Tl|How to}} is most likely best for this part. 

{{How to
