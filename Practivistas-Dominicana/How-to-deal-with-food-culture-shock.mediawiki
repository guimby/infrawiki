==New Country New Food==
The following video was made by [[User:Lexington333|Lexie]] as a how-to/advice to future Practitvistas on how to deal with all new food in the Practivistas Dominicana program.  One of the big aspects of culture shock is food, and living with a host family, you'll feel this more than if you were to visit as a tourist.  The video includes tips on how to navigate your mom and let her know what food you do or don't like, and how to keep a happy stomach and a happy mom.
