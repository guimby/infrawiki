==Introduction==
The air handling system provides a building with necessary ventilation and temperature comfort.  They can be responsible for the distribution of both chilled and heated air.  Used inefficiency, these systems can waste large amounts of energy.

==General Equipment Data==
*Operating schedule (occupied hours/day) <-
*Type (once-through, recirculation)
*Controls (location, type, temperature setback, manual switch between heating/cooling)
*Service Area (single zone, multi zone) <-
*Temperature Sensors (location)
*Air intake requirements (health/safety, pressure, stratification) <-
*Average number of occupants <-
*Humidification requirements <-
*Damper operation (number, location, control/operation)
*Air contaminant sensors (existence, location)
*Air cleaning/filtering (existence, type)
*Economizer cycle (cost of heating vs. cooling, control)
*Exhaust heat recovery (type)
*Local weather patterns <-
*Coil heating (existence, type)
*Fan motors (single speed, multi-speed)
*Thermostat deadband

==Room Conditioning Units==
The room conditioning units include such devices as radiators and convectors.  These devices may work in tandem with the main system, but usually they have individual controls.

''General Information Required:''
*Existence of placards
*Thermostats (timeclock, setback, general settings, location)
*Turn-Off (manual, automatic, indicators)
*Proximity sensors (location)
''Radiators/Convectors''
*Maintenance schedule
*Controls (condition, location) 
*Location (obstruction of heat transfer, air flow)
*Convection Barriers (existence)
*Fan Coil Units (existence, condition, 3-pipe or 2-pipe operation)
*Fan Coil Motor (age, manufacturer)
