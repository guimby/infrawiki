[http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/2000/08ecovillage.php What Is  Ecovillage?]

Ecovillages are a myth - faerie tales told to wide-eyed children at bedtime.

:Q: What is an EcoVillage ?
:A: An ecologically-minded village of people.
:Q: So what is a village ?
:A: Bigger than a hamlet, smaller than a town.
:Q: Do what?
:A: In England, a hamlet denotes a collection of houses, too small to have a parish church. A village has a church, but no market. A town has both a market and a church or churches. 

Hmmm... Is that 100 people, 500 people ?

First of all, a market implies that the village members have some amount of surplus production.  If there is no surplus, there is no market, and therefor no village.  A market also implies that the villagers are exchanging a significant portion of their goods and services with each other.  Since one hundred percent is impossible, what is significant ? Fifty percent ?  Can one-hundred people produce/consume enough surplus to provide 50 percent of each others needs ?  

At what standard of living ?  Lower the standard of living sufficiently, and any number of people can be provided for.  Perhaps it is possible in a third-world setting. Maybe that is why there are no eco-villages in the United States.

What do you think ?
