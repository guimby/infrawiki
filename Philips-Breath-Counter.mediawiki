==Problem being addressed==
Infant pneumonia is one of the leading causes of fatalities in children under the age of five, claiming more than two million children's lives every year.

==Detailed description of the solution==
The Breath Counter measures the number of breaths taken by a patient to diagnose pneumonia.   Once an activation button is pressed, the device counts each breath taken by an infant for one minute. A total of three tests are taken, and the count results for all three tests are displayed on an LCD screen.  The device is powered by solar cells and has a lifespan of more than five years.  It can be worn around the neck.
