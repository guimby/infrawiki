The Rev. Joel Hunter is the senior pastor of Northland Church a megachurch in Longwood, FL.

Hunter is also the founder of the Christian Citizen, and the Alliance for the Distributed Church. In 2006 he was selected to become the next president of the Ultra Conservative Christian Coalition, but then declined the job stating that he wanted to focus on issues other than abortion and same-sex marriage (such as [[poverty]] and [[environmental]] education), but Coalition leaders did not.[http://grist.org/news/maindish/2006/12/20/hunter/][http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-roberts/an-interview-with-rev-jo_b_36810.html]
