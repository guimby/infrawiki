'''Fission''' 
==Definition==

Fission is the process of releasing [[energy]] when the mass between the product nuclei and the reactants has been concerted into energy in order to obtain a much larger percentage of nuclei of a target involved in releasing energy.

==Important features of:==
*additional neutrons are emitted
*leads to [["chain reaction"]] of neighboring molecules
*low yield of reaction

==How it works==
* process produces [[Fission Products]] which are "unstable [[radioactive isotopes]] produced when a [[uranium]] nucleus is split after capturing a neuron.
* neutrons trigger the target nucleus causing it to split into many different components such as: [[neutrons]], [[fission product]], and [[neutron]]
* once these products are released create a [[nuclear chain reaction]]

==Energy released From Each Fission==

(according to PH261 Slides)
    165 MeV   ~ [[kinetic energy]] of fission products
      7 MeV   ~ [[gamma rays]]
      6 MeV   ~ [[kinetic energy]] of the [[neutrons]]
      7 MeV   ~ energy from fission products
      6 MeV   ~ gamma rays from fission products
      9 MeV   ~ [[anti-neutrinos]] from fission products
----------------
    200 MeV

==Controls of Nuclear Fission==
*Only One neutron out of 2 or 3 will strike another molecules nucleus
*Controlled by a [[Neutron-Absorbing material]]such as Graphite
