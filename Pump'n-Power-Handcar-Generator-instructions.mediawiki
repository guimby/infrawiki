=== Introduction ===
The following is a brief overview of the steps the create your own [[Flock House Handcar Generator|Pump'n Power]] generator. Given the complexity of the design for this project, the finer details of the project are left to the builder to specify. Such details include the placement of supports, placement of the generator mounting point and plate, length of the pump lever, and method of attachment at each point. 

===Frame===
To build the frame you will need two bicycles. At least one should have functionally rotating pedals, wheels, and crank at the bottom bracket. The other bicycle need only contain a frame and handlebars; it will be referred to as the "scrap bicycle" and used as framing material. For the frame, most of the support pieces are welded to the main frame. The rear support is mounted to the rear axle position thereby two rear bicycle frame components are mounted to the same rear axle.

|2|Disassemble one bicycle down to the frame by removing the brakes, shifters, derailleurs, handlebars, front forks, and wheels. Leave at least one pedal on, noted in the next step. Separate the front and rear wheels from their hubs by cutting and removing their spokes. These will be used later.

=== Pump Lever and Crank Shaft===
The pump lever is made up of steel square bar stock, a front bicycle wheel hub with quick release axle, two handle bars from the two bicycles, and the pedal that was removed earlier. The crank shaft is made up of round bar stock with an internal diameter that is the same as the diameter of the pedal material removed from the crank so that it can be inserted into the round bar and secured.

|2|Using the previously removed pedal and round bar stock, insert the pedal shaft into the end of the round bar stock. Using U-bolts, mount the pedal to the underside of the square bar stock.  The round bar stock will be the crank shaft. Determine the length of the crank shaft by adjusting the position of the pedal on the square bar stock while temporarily attaching the crank shaft to the lower pedal. The crank shaft whould be attached so that the crank at the bottom bracket rotates smoothly.

|3|Once the length of the crank shaft is determined, mount the crank shaft to the crank pedal.

|4|Once the position of the crank shaft is determined on the square bar stock, cut length of the square bar stock to even lengths from the middle. The attach previously removed handlebars to the ends of the square bar to create a pump lever.

=== Generator ===
The generator is mounted below, and chained into, the rear cassette.
