Dr. Doshi, of the large densely packed city [[Mumbai]], India, has developed [[food production techniques for his context.

His [[city garden]] methods are [[appropriate]] to apply in reduced spaces as terraces and balconies, even on civil construction walls, and for not requiring big investments in capital or long hours of work. His farming practice is purely organic and is mainly directed to domestic consumption. His gardening tools are composed of materials available in the local environment: sugarcane waste, polyethylene bags, tires, containers and cylinders, and soil. The containers and bags (open at both ends) are filled with the sugarcane stalks, compost, and garden soil, which make possible the use of minimal quantity of water if compared to open fields. 

Dr. Doshi states that solar energy can replace soil in cities.{{fact}} He also recommends the idea of chainplanting, or growing plants in intervals and in small quantities rather than at once and in large amounts. He has grown different types of fruit such as mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, and sugarcane stalks in his terrace of 120 m2 (1200 sq ft) in Bandra.  The concept of city farming developed by Dr. Doshi consumes the entire householdâ€™s organic waste. He subsequently makes the household self-sufficient in the provision of food: 5kg of fruits and vegetables are produced daily for 300 days a year.
