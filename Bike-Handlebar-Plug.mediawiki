==Abstract==
# A customizable Bike Handlebar Plug designed using OpenSCAD.
[[Image:BikeplugOpenSCAD.png|300px|right]]

== Bill of Materials==
* A bike with a handlebar
* 3D printed Bike Handlebar Plug

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
* Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* None except for having an OpenSCAD software in order to customize the plug.

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
# Both a .scad and a .stl file will be provided through a Github link for easy download.  [https://github.com/KirillKudaev/BikeHandlebarPlug3DModel Files]
# To successfully print the file make sure your printer is calibrated for a successful print, ie. the extruder produces enough filament for an accurate and reliable print. 
# A print time is estimated to be roughly 50 minutes at a 20 percent infill rate. Times will change based upon individual printer settings.
# Assembly for the OSAT product takes seconds and involves taking the print and plugging it in the bike handlebar.

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
# Make sure to customize the plug parameters using OpenSCAD software in case the default design doesn't fit the handlebar

== Cost savings==
# Normal price for Bike Handlebar Plug on the modern market ~$15
# A commercial equivalent can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Fyxation-Bar-End-Plugs-Black/dp/B006GHDE68/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1493165780&sr=8-1&keywords=bike+handlebar+plug): 
# Average cost per commercial Bike Handlebar Plug $15, cost to produce a 3d printed Bike Handlebar Plug, < $1.00
