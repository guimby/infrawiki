Many of the key concepts of '''[[permaculture]]''' are highly relevant in an '''[[international development]]''' context. Permaculture includes an emphasis on:
* [[Appropriate technology]]
* [[Context]]
* [[Local knowledge]] and [[traditional knowledge]] (which often already include many elements of permaculture, as well as providing new insights for an outsider) 
* Reducing [[fossil fuel]] use

It differs from conventional development philosophy by its greater emphasis on relative [[self-sufficiency]] and environmental [[sustainability]], and in a much greater emphasis on well-being and [[quality of life]] as being distinct from [[economic welfare]].
