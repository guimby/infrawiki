=Experience with Bed Adhesion Agents=
Adhesion scale:
# Hopeless - didn't adhere at all
# Evidence of adhesion, but parts come loose too easily
# Blue tape-like adhesion - sticks well but some issues with warping and/or occasional parts coming loose from bed
# Superior to blue tape - stays flat, very few issues with parts loosening
# Kryptonite bond - parts almost never come loose

Finish scale:
# Blue tape-like mottled finish or adhesion agent sticks to part on removal from platform
# Intermediate - glassy and mottled or some adhesion agent comes off with part
# Glassy smooth

Ambient bed temperature indicates the bed was unheated.

=Silicone Adhesion=
Silicone sticks to almost everything, so adhesion can actually be a problem when it comes to separating the part from the print surface. The following table follows the same format as previous tables, but in this case poor adhesion is a good outcome.

|-
|Window glass||ambient||Wax paper||NA||5||NA||Once cured, there is no separating the part from the wax paper. If attended to before completely cured, it can be separated.
|-
|Window glass||ambient||HDPE||NA||1||NA||The HDPE was cut from a milk jug and was not flat, which presents a different problem. The cured part separated beautifully.
