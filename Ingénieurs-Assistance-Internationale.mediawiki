Ingénieurs Assistance Internationale – Ingénieurs sans Frontières (Isf) is a Belgian NGO (a non-profit organisation) assisting developing areas of the world with their engineering needs and whose fundamental purpose is to adapt technological development to the needs of those living in underprivileged areas.

==Introduction==
[[File:ISF_IAI_logo.png|thumb|right|200px|ISF_IAI logo]]
Founded on the initiative of a few engineers and with the support of the Associations of Schools for Engineers, IsF can count on the contribution of several hundred volunteers: engineers with varying qualifications and students willing to put their time and skills at the disposal of development projects.

Thanks to many contacts in both professional and associative environment, IsF can seek advice from engineers and technicians on specific problems in every sector of technology. All IsF work is done on a voluntary basis. If you wish to take an active part in the life of the organization, you can register here.

IsF, looking for the best synergies with other Belgian NGOs, has formed the CHAKA group with CODEART and ADG, both Belgian associations. IsF is also a member of the Federation of the French and German speaking NGOs of Belgium (ACODEV) and is approved by the General Directorate for International Cooperation of the Belgian Federal Government. (DGCI)

Isf is also a member of international EWB [[Engineers Without Borders]]

==Technical Documentation==

The questionnaires below enable non-technicians to identify correctly and precisely their resources and needs thereby allowing our engineers to plan a coherent project in a specific technical field. They are available on the isf [http://www.isf-iai.be/index.php?id=26&L=2  download page]

They allow anyone to raise the right questions and facilitate the communication between the recipients of the project and the technicians who will be in charge of its implementation. 

*Questionnaire to identify an irrigation project  correctly  
*Questionnaire to identify a project for the production  and/or distribution of electricity 
*Questionnaire to facilitate the choice of radio  communication equipment 
*Questionnaire in view of installing a wind mill for water pumping 
*Questionnaire to identify hydrogeological resources
