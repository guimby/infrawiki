'''Humanitarian engineering''' is the application of [[appropriate technology]] to directly improve the lives of marginalized communities. In other words, it is using engineering methodologies in [[research]] and [[design]] in a context of constraints - typically resource limitations, but also influences of [[climate]], [[culture]] and [[isolation]]. It may also apply to [[disaster relief]].

Its targeted audience, marginalized and underserved, is a strong contrast to conventional engineering, industry and business - hence the phrase "Design for the Other 90%" used in [[Paul Polak]]'s work. 

Training for humanitarian engineering may incorporate a thorough study of the [[principles of development]], as well as introductions to economics, microfinance and sociology, as well as rigorous engineering basics. In specific contexts it is important to understand the history, politics and [[language]].

In the context [[disaster relief]], these factors are less important than the ability to solve problems quickly and effectively with only what is available, and the ability to coordinate a project and manage logistics in a stressed environment.

[[NGOs]] such as [[AIDG]] and [[IDE]] focus on applying humanitarian engineering through appropriate technology and business. Others, such as [[Practical Action]] and [[Appropedia]], focus on providing essential knowledge resources to those engaged in humanitarian engineering work.

Some universities now focus on Humanitarian Engineering.
