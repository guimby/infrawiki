A resilient community has the ability to survive an extended disconnection from the global grid in areas including:

* [[Energy]].
* [[Food]].
* [[Security]] (both active and passive).
* [[Communications]].
* [[Transportation]]. 

[[Sustainability]] and [[local production]] are essential elements of this. 

The aim of a resilient community is:
:"...to enjoy the fruits of globalization without being completely vulnerable to its excesses." - John Robb[http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2008/01/the-resilient-c.html]
