{{topic header| default.png | Emergency management}}  

Emergency management involves prevention, education, immediate response, and medium to long term recovery and reconstruction.

Natural and human-caused disasters continue to be regular events in developing countries. Some of the original damage is avoidable; several of the items included here discuss low-cost ways to minimize damage to houses from earthquakes and hurricanes, for example. Some of the damage comes after the initial disaster, as water supplies are polluted and perhaps food supplies are interrupted. The relief efforts themselves can cause additional damage. This may happen if the basic food supply was not affected by the original disaster, and a sudden inflow of donated food distorts the agricultural produce markets. This kind of common event means a second economic disaster for the farmers.

This category might provide experienced management guidelines for maximizing the positive effects of disaster relief operations while minimizing the negative side effects. Public health measures, control of medical supplies, and housing reconstruction are major topic areas.

<blockquote>
Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning.' - Dwight D. Eisenhower{{w|Dwight D. Eisenhower}} ([http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eisenhower quotes]). Speech to the National Defense Executive Reserve Conference in Washington, D.C. (November 14, 1957)
