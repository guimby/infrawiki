'''Ducks''' are used by [[Bali]]nese farmers to seek and eat [[snails]] in their [[rice]] fields. This treats the snails as a food source, an input into duck farming, rather than an expensive problem to be treated with chemicals. It is a traditional [[agricultural]] technique which is consistent with [[permaculture]].
