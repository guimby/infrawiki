Land value capture (LVC) refers to an urban planning approach that aims to support paying for improved public infrastructure in an area by at least partially recouping the increment in land values in the area resulting from the improved infrastructure.

For example, LVC has been used to fund improvements to [[Public transport]] networks, especially heavy rail, in cities such as [[London]], in the United Kingdom.
