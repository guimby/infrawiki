The Chispito wind turbine or "Chispito Wind Generator" is a simple DIY HAWT [[Wind turbine|wind turbine]]. It is primarily used as an educational project for those interested in wind turbine construction, and generates little power so as to allow actual use in off-grid homes. 

==Charisteristics and construction==
Most of the parts can be sourced in junk or [[salvage]] yards, and the construction requires minimal tools and skills. The project is designed to be open source and simple to create and maintain.

Chispito can produce 100 watts in a 30 mph wind.  It can be built by two people in about three hours.  Parts include 8" PVC sewer pipe for the blades, a treadmill motor for the generator, and various metal bits and pieces, including a washing machine casing for the tail.

==Difficulties==
Sourcing parts can be difficult for some areas.  On the website, [http://www.velacreations.com/parts.html], we examine possible solutions to hard to find parts.  Also, wind generators can pose a threat to people and animals.  Always stand up wind from a wind generator and never let it free spin.  The wind generator should also be connected to a load or be shorted out.
