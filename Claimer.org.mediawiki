'''Claimer.org'''[http://www.claimer.org] is an organization whose goal is to reduce climate change and the negative effects climate change creates.

This goal is pursued by the accumulation of climate change damage claims for the future compensation of such damages. These actions give corporations, that contribute to climate change, an additional monetary incentive not to use technologies that pollute the atmosphere and therefore contribute to climate change. This should motivate firms to consider switching to options that do not pollute the environment.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://stop.zona-m.net/2011/04/claimer-org-tries-to-make-it-easier-to-claim-damages-by-climate-change/ |title= Claimer.org tries to make it easier to claim damages by climate change |publisher= Stop |author= Marco Fioretti |date= 15 Apr, '11}}</ref>
