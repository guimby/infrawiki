More than 60 organisations in the UK alone offer some kind of technical support service to the development and relief sector.

Entire organisations are dedicated to the cause of sharing ‘know how’ to help make a difference in projects around the world.

Agencies invest time, money and some very clever people to help improve access to ‘know how’ for people in the field and for people wanting to find their own solutions.

This public event will bring together leading providers of technical knowledge for development and humanitarian relief.
