Various methods of preserving milk include pasteurizing, dehydrating, evaporating, condensing and canning.

Milk is often turned into other [[dairy]] products, like [[cheese]] or [[butter]], which have a longer shelf life.

Milk production raises various issues of animal welfare, [[health]] and [[environmental impact]]. Dairy waste is very high in [[biochemical oxygen demand]] and may be suitable for producing [[biogas]].

The nutritional qualities of milk are claimed to depend on the diet of the cattle, with grass-fed cattle producing milk with healthier [[fats]].

[[Grain]]-fed cattle have a high [[ecological footprint]], requiring large areas of land to produce the grain. Such practices increase the demand for grains, and thus [[food prices]] and [[food security]], especially in [[developing countries]].<ref>The impact is greater in developing countries and particularly the foods purchased by the poorer segments of those countries, because the price of basic foodstuffs makes up a greater proportion of the price of purchased foods. Non-grain foods are not directly affected, but the demand for land to produce food for livestock will indirectly increase the price of all foods.</ref>
