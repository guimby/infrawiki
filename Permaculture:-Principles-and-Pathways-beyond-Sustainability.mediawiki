The publication in December 2002 of a new major work on permaculture, saw a deeper and more accessible systematisation of the principles of permaculture refined by David Holmgren over more than 25 years of practice. The book, '''''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability''''' (2002), is dedicated to [[Howard T. Odum]], who died two months before its publication, and it owes much to Odum's vision of a world in energy transition.<ref>''A prosperous way down'', Odum and Odum, 2001</ref> The concept of the energy descent future that Holmgren describes in ''Principles and Pathways'' has also been independently articulated by American writer [[John Michael Greer]].

''Principles and Pathways'' offers twelve key [[Principles of permaculture|permaculture design principles]], each explained in separate chapters. The icons used to identify each design principle (created by permaculture graphic designer Richard Telford) have been widely used in teaching these principles around the world. This book filled a conceptual gap that has been evident from permaculture's inception. It is regarded as a major landmark in permaculture literature, especially as the seminal work, [[Bill Mollison]]'s ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'' (1988) was published fifteen years previously and has never been revised.<ref>http://transitionwhatcom.ning.com/profiles/blogs/principles-and-pathways-class</ref>
