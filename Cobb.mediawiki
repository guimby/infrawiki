'''Cobb''' is a type of [[:Category:Earthen construction|earthen construction]] composed, like [[:Category:Adobe|adobe]], of sand, clay, fiber (usually straw) and often other organic ingredients. Cobb is made as one contiguous structure, with clumps of cobb mixture being added to previous cobb clumps, hence the other name for cobb - monolithic adobe-. Cob structures are extremely durable, with many very old structures still in use{{fact}}. They also regulate temperature due to their high [[:Category:Heat#Thermal mass|thermal mass]], which is very usefull in climates with high diurnal temperature swings.

:Need to fix up that old cob bench you made in your back yard? Nat Davies made additions to the cob turtle and also fixed up an older cob bench in the community. A fine cob fixer is she as her hands on application and use of basic tools and techniques provide just the right touch to aid any failing cob project.

:Did you ever notice that place in your back yard where you always want to just sit and kick back but didn't want to install a commercially produced park bench? Jessica Rendon led a supported campaign to finish the construction of the cob bench at the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology at Humboldt State University, California. This cob bench is fully loaded with an urbanite/cinder block foundation, seashell and mirror inlays, inset soil analysis, and more! We do just about everything cob around here. So sit down, kick off your shoes, and stay a while.
