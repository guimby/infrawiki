=== Tools for users ===

* Check [http://www.appropedia.org/index.php?tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=newbie&namespace=&year=&month=-1 contributions by new users]

== Community ==

You will need:
* Community members with email alerts enabled. When multiple people have pages on their watchlist and have email alerts enabled, they can easily keep track of changes to pages. 
* People checking the [[Special:RecentChanges|RecentChanges]] page regularly. New pages are on no one's watchlist, so 
* Protection against misinformation - seek qualified people in the field to be a part of your community. (Trying to recruit a single person rarely works - spread the message widely, and keep spreading it, and see who responds.) This is less important than it sounds, i.e. qualified experts are not essential to creating a valuable resource, but it still has great value.
