'''The Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF)''' is an association of students and faculty at [[Wikipedia:Humboldt State University|Humboldt State University]],[[Wikipedia:California|California]], working towards the shared goal of attaining energy independence at HSU while providing unique educational opportunities for students. ''Energy independence'' refers to elimination of the practice of importing energy from external energy suppliers. '''HEIF''' is as a student led program designed to orchestrate open communication networks between students, faculty, staff, campus/local governments, and other appropriate bodies.

===The Fund===
The mission of the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund is to reduce the environmental impact of energy use at Humboldt State University through student driven projects.
Pursuit of energy independence is achieved through a pool of student money called the '''Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF)'''. By self-imposing a fee of $10 per student per semester the '''HEIF''' may allocate up to $160,000 per year to energy conservation/generation projects on campus. 

===Goals of the Fund===

*The HEIF will achieve its mission through projects that are developed by students and, to the extent possible, implemented, monitored, and maintained with strong student involvement.

*The HEIF will require accountability by measuring and reporting quantitative and qualitative results, as well as levels of involvement by students and other participants, in all its projects.

*The HEIF will strive to make its projects derive from and be connected to the curriculum of the university.

*The HEIF will support dissemination of information about its projects through public outreach and educational activities.

*The HEIF will seek to publicize accomplishments and experiences associated with its program and projects through a variety of media.

'''HEIF''' will:
*Increase energy conservation on the HSU campus thereby decreasing campus energy costs by up to $800,000 per year.

*Establish HSU as a national leader in campus [[sustainability]] thereby stimulating enrollment rates and elevating university prestige.

*Create a unique example of a student-integrated campus energy policy that other universities can use as a guide.

*Provide unique educational opportunities for HSU students in various disciplines including but not limited to: Environmental Resources Engineering, Industrial Technology, Environmental Science, and Appropriate Technology.

*Establish HSUâ€™s commitment to environmental responsibility as a cornerstone in both academic curriculum and campus infrastructure development.

===History===
The ''' HEIF''' received an 86% approval rate by HSU students in the spring 2004 Associated Students elections; however, it was overridden at the state level by [[Wikipedia:Charles B. Reed|CSU Chancellor Charles Reed]] on the basis that no new fees were to be instated at that time. '''HEIP''''s lobbying efforts finally paid off in February of 2007 when [[Wikipedia:Rollin C. Richmond|HSU President Rollin Richmond]] announced his plan to fund the HEIF through an increase in the Instructional Related Activities Fee as early as Fall 2007.

On February 1, 2008, the HEIF issued its first ever Request for Proposals. Two outstanding student proposals were selected for implementation these are: to Upgrade the Renewable Energy Student Union's Solar Radiation Monitoring Station to enable remote data acquisition, and to install a 10.5 KWDC grid-connected solar photovoltaic system atop HSU's Old Music Building. In total, HEIF allotted $101,000 towards these two projects.

===Current Activity===

'''HEIF''' is currently evaluating project proposals which were received at the end of the Fall 2008 RFP cycle. In addition, the Old Music Building PV project has been put out to bid and is tentatively scheduled for installation in Summer 2009. For more information on HEIF activities visit the Official HEIF website.

===Participation===
'''HEIF''' meetings are open to the public. For meeting location, dates, and time send your query to heip@humboldt.edu. HEIF proposals may be submitted by students, staff, and faculty at Humboldt State.
