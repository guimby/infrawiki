==Challenge==

The developing world needs every tool it can get to alleviate [[poverty]] in ways that do not increase [[carbon emissions]] or further damage fragile environments. Western technologies often require considerable [[localization]] both technically and in terms of business models, and this does not usually form part of the companies business plan.

==Solution==

[[Natural Innovation]], is developing a standardized '''Humanitarian License''' to reduce the overhead of a for-profit Western company or University licensing a technology to a social venture. It is intended to fill the same place for patents and [[Intellectual Property]] as the [[Creative Commons]] license fills for copyright.
