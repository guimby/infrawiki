==Changing Values in Franklin==
Values in Franklin are presented with an input text box for making changes.  The currently active value is shown next to the box.

Those text boxes permit entry of a value which is then set by pressing the "Enter" key on the keyboard. Values can also be changed by selecting a text box (left click on it) followed by pressing cursor up and down movement keys on the key board:
* Page Up: increase value by 10
* Page Down: Decrease value by 10
* Up arrow: increase value by 1
* Down arrow: decrease value by 1
* Shift + Up arrow: increase value by 0.1
* Shift + Down arrow: decrease value by 0.1

Math can also be performed in the text boxes; entering +1.5 (note plus sign) will add 1.5 to the value, entering +-1.5 (note the plus and the minus signs) will subtract 1.5 from the value.

All values of the same type can be changed at once by making the change in the maroon bar below the values.

Pressing enter on an empty box is the same as entering 0.  Setting a value to something that Franklin cannot understand as a number sets it to NaN ("Not a Number").  For some settings, this is useful; for example, a temperature control is switched off that way.

The special values Infinity and -Infinity can also be entered (note the capital I), which is useful for some settings.
