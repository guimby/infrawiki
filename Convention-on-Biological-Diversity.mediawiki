The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''', known as the Biodiversity Convention or CBD for short, was the first global instrument developed to deal with the protection and conservation of biodiversity. It was opened for signature on 5th June 1992, at the [[Earth Summit]] (the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. It came into force on 29th December 1993.

The CBD is a framework convention. Rather than establishing clear standards for protection of biodiversity, it outlines a regime of protection with a focus on ''in situ'' conservation. It also touches on the restoration of deteriorated ecosystems and the management of gene banks.

The parties to the agreement are under an obligation to protect biodiversity "as far as possible and as appropriate", a phrase found throughout various of the articles within the convention.
