[http://www.fg2w.org/ From Goals to Wells] is a non-profit organization that raises money to build clean, reliable sources of water in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda/ Uganda], Africa. The organization raises funds through youth soccer camps, which are held in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_states/ United States].

== History ==

The organization was founded in 2010 after a college student named Olivia Hinkle visited Uganda and saw first-hand the water problems facing the country. After returning to the United States, Hinkle spoke with friends Lucas Clardy and Kala Gabler and together they created From Goals to Wells. The organization aims to tackle one of Ugandaâ€™s biggest humanitarian issues: access to clean water. 

As of April 2014, From Goals to Wells has built four water filtration systems and also funded a project to provide water pumps to improve crop irrigation for small farmers.

In southern California, From Goals to Wells hosts week-long soccer camps that focus on building the camper's soccer skills, as well as educating them about Ugandan culture and the need for clean water. The cost is $65 USD per camper, and the money goes directly to funding wells and water filtration walls in Uganda. The camps are run for children ages 5-14 and are coached by current and previous college soccer players.

Campers are asked to bring their own gear, snacks and water to the field, and the camp runs from 9am- 12pm Monday through Friday. 

Coaches aim to build relationships with the campers as well as provide them with knowledge of soccer skills. During water breaks and rests, the coaches educate the campers about Ugandan culture, people and the water problems faced by many of the population. The campers also learn about children in Uganda and how their registration fee will make a difference there.

From Goals to Wells partners with a local engineering company in Uganda, AC Engineering, to build the filtration walls. From Goals to Wells and AC Engineering have done multiple field trips in areas surrounding Gulu, Uganda to locate villages that could benefit from a water filtration wall. Currently there are over 15 villages on the waiting list.

=== From Goals to Wells' Commitment to Campers ===
*Education about Ugandan Culture
*Build Confidence in the Campers
*Grow in their Knowledge of Soccer
*Have Fun at the Camp

== Costs ==

Each water filtration system costs between $1500 and $2000 USD. Each water filtration wall that is sponsored by From Goals to Wells can serve up to 2,000 people for 10- 15 years.

== Water Crisis in Uganda==

In the 90s, Uganda made great leaps to reorganize their water infrastructure, but even so 38% of Ugandans were still without access to a clean, reliable source of water in 2010. 

Ugandans suffering from HIV/ AIDS are more susceptible to water-borne pathogens, such as cholera and typhoid fever. Poor water sanitation also lends itself to the propagation of mosquitoes, the main way that the malaria is transmitted. Children are especially vulnerable to these diseases, as their bodies are less able to fight off pathogens. Many children are unable to go to school and their parents are unable to work, which puts the strength of the Ugandan economy and community at risk.
