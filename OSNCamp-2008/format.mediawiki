* Mainly or entirely "unconference" or "BarCamp" in style , i.e. ad hoc, anyone can run a session.
* Many presentations will be announced beforehand (and can be listed on the registration page when that is set up, like at the BarCamp wiki).
* Ideas for session types include:
**20 min sessions on the Saturday and 30 min on the Sunday (this was popular at BarCampSydney3)
**One or more pitch sessions, where presenters get a few minutes each to describe/promote their idea.
**Technology sessions - as above but describing a sustainable or [[appropriate technology]]
**Speed networking - like speed dating... but with less hope of romance.
