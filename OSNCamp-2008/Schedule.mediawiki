=== OSN Workshops===
Bringing relevant parties together provides the opportunity to: 

# Discuss what "Open" means -- is it only text? pictures? ideas?  Intellectual property?  Patents?
# Identify existing initiatives, and learn from successes and failures. 
# Identify existing tools - Their advantages and disadvantages
# Perform a gap analysis and identify opportunities for collaboration -- NGOs, community based orgs (CBOs), individuals, academics, "repositories and collaboration sites", donors, governments, churches, for-profit entities offering DIY kits and AT, etc,.
# Identify a broader network of practitioners with experience in online collaboration
# Enlist support of additional parties to build the network and scale up impact.
# Establish short and long term goals for effectively implementing an Open Sustainability Network
# Determine means of quality control and quality assurance - potential rating dimensions, raters, accrediting test labs,

=== Workshop #1: Online Education ===
'''Goal:''' Develop a framework for online course hosting at the Open Sustainability Network. 

One of the goals of the [[Open Sustainability Network]] is to build a unified collection of relevant online tools and practices to help students and teachers build effective programs in [[appropriate technology]] and [[social entrepreneurship]].  Specifically, the OSN is focused on impacting the training of future innovators and managers who will need to effectively tackle a set of profound global challenges through the creation, commercialization and institutionalization of sustainable enterprise and clean technologies.  

=== Workshop #2: Collaborative Taxonomies ===
'''Goal:''' Develop a system of taxonomies to classify and share technologies, implementation efforts, projects, educational resources, impacts and community information. Define methods of collaboration.

=== Workshop #3: Online Publications ===
'''Goal:''' Define best practices in online publications. In particular this workshop will determine how to best navigate copyright and patent law and the best methods for encouraging [[open source appropriate technology]] in a range of contexts.

If you are planning to drive from campus to the event, and are willing to carpool, check our [[OSNCon/carpool | carpool]] page.  This event will be running most of the previous week also (October 15 â€“ 19, 2008
9:00am - 5:30 pm). ''Organized by David Reber.''

'''Comment/question''': We can presumably adjust the timing of the visit, as long as we get there by about 4 or 4:30? Some attendees have to return to Humboldt County on the Sunday evening, and ''may'' want to leave before this.
