Your membership in the ________ Facebook group indicates that you believe that sustainable solutions should be shared whenever possible. We are gathering together a large community of like-minded people, called the Open Sustainability Network (OSN), to work on overcoming barriers to openness and collaboration. The first OSN conference will be at San Francisco State University in the United States on October 18th-19th, 2008 and admission is free.  

You are invited.
