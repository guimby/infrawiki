== Register as a presenter ==
If you think you would like to present or convene a session at the OSN conference, please add your idea in the appropriate area on the [[Open_Sustainability_Network_Conference_2008/presentations|Presentations page]]. Being a BarCamp (everyone is a participant; multiple streams) nothing is finalized until the day, but listing your idea helps us all plan the days. 

It's very free, so you don't need official approval before adding your name. (Please be considerate though, and check the level of interest, and whether altering your topic might be better at engaging people.)

Thank you for your interest in OSNCon 2008, and please spread the word.
