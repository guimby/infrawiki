== Accommodations ==
Wiki Travel has a [http://wikitravel.org/en/San_Francisco great page on San Francisco] including recommendations for places to stay.  This Organizer's strong personal recommendation is [http://www.greentortoise.com/ Green Tortise] - get a room as high up as possible and book early as they will fill long before the conference.

Also, check the [[OSNCon/Couches]] to see if any kind San Franciscans have offered up their couch space.

== Transportation Directions ==

[http://www.sfsu.edu/~sfsumap/ Campus Map] if you drive, park at park at the parking structure at F-5 (those are coordinates on the map).  Our building is marked as "C. Chavez Student Center".  The main conference room is in "Jack Adams Hall" on the top floor.

[http://www.sfsu.edu/~parking/directions/ Directions to Campus]  Information for those planning to drive, walk, bike, or (my favorite) take public transportation.

The [[OSNCon/Carpool|Carpool]] page can be used by people who are planning to drive in and are willing to share/borrow a seat - you can also check [www.cragislist.org cragislist] for carpooling opportunities.
