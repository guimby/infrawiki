'''Bamboo''' is a fast growing plant from the subfamily (Bambusoideae) of flowering perennial evergreen plants in the grass family Poaceae.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo</ref>

== Growing bamboo ==
Bamboos prefer moist and rich soil for best growth. However, many bamboos can tolerate a range of soil and climate conditions, you just need to select the right one.

Some bamboos are invasive but there are non-invasive, smaller varieties of bamboo that can be grown in the garden without having them take over. Some of these include:

*Miniature sacred bamboo (''Nandina domestica'' "Nana") - this is a dwarf variety

*Hedge bamboo (''B. multiplex'') – this variety is great for containers and can also be grown as a hedge

*Giant timber bamboo (''Bambusa oldhamii'') - this is a good screening plant that can be trained as a hedge

*Buddha's belly bamboo (''B. ventricosa'') – with the right care, this bamboo can be kept small and non-spreading
