==Introduction==
The Green Campus Program is a Statewide student-implemented energy efficiency program at 12 UC and CSU campuses and Stanford University.  Green Campus is a program of the non-profit organization The Alliance to Save Energy.  The Program has been made possible through grants and funding from the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and the ratepayers of California. HSU Green Campus operates under the auspices of PG&E, SCE, and UC/CSU/IOU Energy Efficiency Partnership.[http://www.humboldt.edu/~greenhsu/cms/]
