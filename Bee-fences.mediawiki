'''Bee fences''' are being trialled in [[Kenya]] to keep elephants out of farmers' land. 

Since elephants have been allowed to return to many areas of [[Africa]], conflict between the animals and farmers has been a problem. Traditional thorn fences are ineffective, and elephants and humans have been killed in the conflict.

Bees' nests are hung up in a row, forming a "fence." (The nests may be live or empty - live nests with honey bees may be a valuable source of income, but empty nests may be preferred close to homes, especially where there are children.) Elephants recognize the nests, and avoid the possibility of bee stings, which be very painful in sensitive areas such as around their eyes. 

Trials so far are very promising.
