The [http://www.ijsle.org International Journal for Service Learning in Engineering: Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship] (IJSLE) was created in 2006 and is a complement to Appropedia's [[:Category:Projects|project]] area.  The IJSLE provides a faculty reviewed venue for submitted academic papers.  While Appropedia seeks to be open for all to submit, regardless of language, style or depth, the IJSLE follows much tighter guidelines.  In addition Appropedia, provides a venue for these projects to be updated at will.

== Mission ==
The Journal seeks to nurture service learning in engineering as a distinct body of knowledge, especially in the context of humanitarian and social entrepreneurship. A primary purpose of the Journal is to foster inquiry into rigorous engineering design and research and to direct those efforts to service-related projects. The examination of cultural appropriateness and its inclusion in design and research efforts is emphasized along with the application of [[appropriate technologies]]. Focus is also placed on associated service learning pedagogy and the dissemination of project results.

The Journal is a forum for disseminating the results of service learning efforts by undergraduate and graduate engineering students from around the world and associated pedagogy.

The Journal is a repository for information related to design and research projects in service. These projects may either be partially, or wholly, complete with dissemination serving to facilitate continued project development.
