==Abstract==

In the undeveloped countries , there are large number in people who are engaged in labour work. They carry tonnes of weight everyday for wages. This project , has been designed to help such people. The load carrier is designed in such a way , that the weight of is evenly distributed and the laborer would not get tired. It is 3 Way load carrier which functions as a trolley, as a overhead load carrier and also as a backpack.

== Bill of Materials==
# 8 "1 inch "PVC pipes( 1 feet each ): 0.5*8=4 $
# 2 "1 inch "PVC pipes( 2 feet each ):0.5*4=2 $
# 8 bolts: 1/4 inch diameter with approx 5 cm length: 30 cents x 3 = 0.9 $
# 8 Nuts that fit into those bolts:  17 cents x 3 = USD 0.51
# bearings( skate board bearings would work) :2*1.25=2.5 USD
# PLA filament: Approx 260 grams = 5.72 USD 

The STL files and FreeCAD files for the parts can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1184910

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Knowledge of FreeCAD, Opensscad and Cura

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
-
To Assemble:
-
# Download the part files provided above in the bill of materials
# Convert stl files to gcode using software like Cura
# Print all of the Parts
# Attach the bearings on the gear shaped parts. Then attach the gears to the connectors which have 8mm rods( there are only 2 of them).
# Connect the interlocking parts as seen in picture. Connect all L shaped parts at the joints.
# Connect the 4 Clamps with two holes and use nut and bolts to fit them.
# Connect the U shaped printed parts to the clamped portion.
-
Time:
* Total print time estimate: 10 hours
* Total assembly time estimate: 30 minutes

=== Common Problems and Solutions===
* One must be careful of your printer radius and calibration as a couple of those parts only just fit into my Delta: check how thw first couple of layers print and shrink the models if needed (all be same amount)
* Sticking to the bed could be a common problem in case of such large prints: Use high quantities of washable glue on bed before printing
*''' Please use high infill for printed parts or they may not carry the required load'''

== Cost savings==
# Cost Estimate: USD 13.5$
# Equivalent products in market cost:Not available in market.
#Net savings achieved:
