'''Energy storage''' is accomplished by devices or physical media that store some form of energy to perform some useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator.

==Most popular techniques==
Some of the most frequently used energy storage devices are ie (regular or deep-cycle) lead-sulpheric acid-batteries placed at the home to overcome the regular power outtages that occur in developing countries (as the power plants in many developing countries don't always operate continuously). The advantage of these is that they are very easy to hook up to existing electrical systems and ie PV-solar panels.

Other techniques (mentioned in the above linked document) are to use electricity to create a (combustible) gas, use electricity to move a weight (ie stones, water, ...) and then allow the water, stones, ... to power an alternator/dynamo at a time when electricity is wanted.

Mobile devices are often powered using small [[electrochemical cell]]s.
