{{SfGS}} 

Hi gang,

Thanks for helping to develop our SfGS wiki! 

Here are a few quick thoughts to help orient you to our new wiki space:

* The wiki is essentially a set of linked pages that everyone can edit for ease of information sharing.

* Each of our SfGS pages has a name of the format:

 ''SfGS page name''

* To edit a page, click on the "edit" tab at the top of the page of interest. This will take you to a text box where you can edit the page.
* To link to an '''existing''' page (e.g. the SfGS funding sources), just add the following text:
  <nowiki>  [[SfGS funding sources]] </nowiki>

* To make a '''new''' page, simply make a link to your new page in an existing page. Page links look like this:
 <nowiki>  [[SfGS page name here]] </nowiki>

*If you want to link to a page (e.g. SfGS publications) but have the link name look different than the page name (e.g. Stuff we made), you can write the following: 
  <nowiki>[[SfGS pubilcations| Stuff we made]] </nowiki>

*To add an SfGS navigator menu in the upper right hand of a page, be sure to type <nowiki>{{SfGS}}</nowiki> at the top of your new page.  This will also categorize the page as part of {{Cl|Students for Global Sustainability}}.

* To make a word '''bold''', add three apostrophes on each side of the word, as shown here:
 <nowiki> '''something'''</nowiki>
* To make something ''italic'', add two apostrophes on each side of the word, as shown here:
 <nowiki> ''something''</nowiki>
* To add an html link, use the following format:
 <nowiki>[http://your.website.org Link_name] </nowiki>

* To add an file (e.g. Schedule.doc) to a page (e.g. SfGS foo), do the following:
** Click on the "upload file" link in the left hand toolbar
** Follow instructions. Be sure to follow the instructions there.
** In page SfGS foo, add the following code:
 <nowiki>  [[Media: Schedule.doc]] </nowiki>

With these few tricks, you should be able to do just about everything you'll need to do. For more information, try out the help link on the left navigation bar.
