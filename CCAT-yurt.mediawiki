==The Yurt at CCAT==
[[Image:Yurt5.gif]]

The yurt at CCAT, as pictured above, differs in design from both traditional and imported styles of yurts. The most notable differences are that the walls are made out of plywood board and the roof is covered in wood shingles. Also, on the inside, there is a bench built into the wall that circumscribes the entire floor.

This yurt was built to be a permanent structure and is used on campus for a gathering place. Please see [http://www.ccathsu.com/ CCAT’s webpage] and take the virtual tour for more pictures of the yurt.

Over the years many improvements have been made to the yurt including the addition of a solar PV system to power LED lights and small AC loads and a new roof made from recycled cans that is fully equipped with Liter-of-Light bottles to provide day lighting. See the operation and maintenance instructions on how to best care for this technology at the Appropedia page [[CCAT yurt/OM]].

==Update 2013==
