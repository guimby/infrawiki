Since 1910 chlorine has been used in the disinfection process of wastewater because of its success in eliminating high rates of water-borne illnesses.<ref name="Water Quality and Health Council">Water Quality and Health Council.

Chlorine (Cl<sub>2</sub>) reacts with water (H<sub>2</sub>O):<ref name="wikipedia">Chlorination. Accessed online March 27th, 2008. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorination </ref> 

'''Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → HOCl + HCl''' 

The resulting hypochlorous acid (HOCl) disassociates into hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) and hypochlorite (OCl<sup>-</sup>) ions: 

'''HOCl ---&gt; H+ + OCl¯''' 

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a weak acid that penetrates the cell membrane of wastewater [[pathogens]], destroying the enzymes within the cytoplasm. Wastewater pathogens killed through chlorination include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and amoebic cysts. <ref name="Davis">Davis, Mackenzie, and Susan Masten.

Chlorine’s effectiveness as a disinfectant depends upon:<ref name="Davis" /> 

*chlorine detention time and concentration 
*wastewater pH and temperature 
*total suspended solids (turbidity) 
*other reactive species in the water (hydrogen sulfide, organics)
*pathogen (cryptosporidium, for example, is highly resistant to chlorine)
