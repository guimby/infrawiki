== What is biting me? ==
[http://www.biteremedy.com/ BiteRemedy.com Spider and Bug Bite Treatment Guide] has pictures, but the bed bug bites don't look the same as many other pictures available.

If there is a definitive guide to identifying bites, please add it here!

== Control ==
Beware of pesticide use, especially on beds: significant amounts may be needed, which is harmful for the people using the beds.

These methods are recommended for bedbugs - would they work for fleas and lice as well?
* Hang or spread sheets and blankets in the sun often.
* If there appear to be bedbugs, pour boiling water on the bed and wash the sheets and blankets.
* Salt water kills bedbugs. Soaking a bed in salt water is a method used by locals in Kenya.[http://www.make-digital.com/make/vol13/?pg=104]
