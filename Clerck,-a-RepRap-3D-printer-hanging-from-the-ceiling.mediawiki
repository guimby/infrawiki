== Background ==
The RepRap project first showed the world cheap small scale 3D printing in 2006.
Their design was intentionally not very well thought out.
The idea was that a 3D printer that could print its own parts would be improved through evolution like iterations, no matter the quality of the first design.
This turned out to be quite correct, as a large community quickly grew around the first few RepRap designs.
RepRap users started to experiment and remix all parts of the printer, including its Cartesian coordinate system.

== Understanding the market ==
Early non-Cartesian 3D printer designs were the Tripod-Repstrap<ref>http://builders.reprap.org/search/label/tripod</ref>(2007) and its geometrically similar successors Rostock (2012)<ref>http://reprap.org/wiki/Rostock</ref> and Lisa Simpson (2013)<ref>http://reprap.org/wiki/LISA_Simpson</ref><ref>http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?178,267835</ref>.
Other non-carthesian RepRap designs include GUS Simpson (2013)<ref>http://reprap.org/wiki/GUS_Simpson</ref>, Morgan (2013)<ref>http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap_Morgan</ref>, Wally (2013)<ref>http://reprap.org/wiki/Wally</ref> and Feather (2013)<ref>http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?1,214837,214859</ref>.

All these printers tries to trade heavier geometrical computations for getting rid of hardware requirements or time consuming build steps.
They all have frames, and there's still spare clock cycles left in their Arduino CPUs.
The idea of Clerck is to skip the hard custom frame altogether and instead rely on wire-connections to already-built rigid structures, like insides of houses.

Making this work would lead to potentially enormous print volumes for prices down to ca $300. Competitors' prices are:

Other large scale experimental printers include the Wasp's Big Delta Printer<ref>http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150914-wasp-big-delta-3d-printer-has-potential-to-build-insect-repelling-houses.html</ref> and the KamerMaker, a scaled up Cartesian design<ref>http://3dprintcanalhouse.com/</ref>. Other experimental solutions for large scale printing include replacing the frame with line tracking capabilities and a support vehicle, like the Minibuilders<ref>http://robots.iaac.net/#robots</ref>.

The presented competitors are very expensive and not very self reproducing, many of them are not even free design hardware.
They don't satisfy the needs of for example the Open Source Ecology project, who wants to print structural plastic components like car body panels and redworm towers with OSHW tools.

== Project goals ==

# Low part count
# Easy to print, assemble, install and distribute
# Huge build volume
# Cheap
# Able to print many of its own parts

== Design ==

* Put all the hardware (except AC/DC-converter) in one single unit.
* Only one force vector upwards, compensated with counter weight.
* Over-constraining allows flexible compensation of slack lines.
* When printer is idle, one could retract all the strings. Enables elegant storage solutions. Could make it popular in big cities, where indoor area is scarce.
* Parallel lines attached to common spools to prevent rotation.

== Costs ==
This is estimation of costs based on what I paid for the prototype parts. Note that variation is significant based on market development and shipping costs.

== Difficulties ==
* Keeping rotations small, despite forces from
** Power cable
** Filament
** Accelerating motors
* Keeping filament and power cable from gears, print and (outside of) hot end.
* Accurate enough firmware configuration to keep lines tight throughout print volume
* Finding home position reliably and repeatably

=== Home position ===
If an IMU unit (accelerometer + gyro) was added, this might be the only needed sensor.
Homing could be done like this:
# If printer is not horizontal, tighten D-lines until it is
# Lower printer (extend D-lines) until hot end crashes into print surface
# Set D-length. D-axis is now calibrated
# Extend D-lines an additional 2 mm
# While not horizontal:
## Calculate direction of inclination
## Tighten A, B or C to counteract inclination
# Tighten D-lines 2 mm
# We are now at home position, all axes calibrated

=== Automatic slack line compensation idea ===
An IMU unit could be used during print the following way:
# Compute some quantity describing "expected jerk" from gcode (Marlin and other firmware already does this. In Marlin the value would be tucked into the block_t struct)
# Use IMU to record "observed jerk" (again tucking it into block_t in Marlin)
# Write a function <code>F(expected jerk, observed jerk)</code> &rarr; <code>Move_to_tighten_strings</code>, and call it once in a while

Since cheap 6-axis IMUs are really good at recording rotation, I expect the notion of "jerk" to include rotation (with expected rotation always 0). Timing will be really important, but Hangprinter-Marlin already has five <code>nop</code> operations in the middle of the stepping code (see the workhorse function in <code>stepper.cpp</code>), that could be utilized for IMU readings at precisely the right times. The <code>nop</code>s are just there to wait for drv8825 stepper driver chips anyways.

Thanks to [http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?178,344022,445503#msg-445503 Dejay on forums.reprap.org] for pointing out the possibility of a similar mechanism.

=== Next steps ===

* Adding cheap IMU unit like the MPU-6050
* Building a smaller version of Clerck using Nema14 motors for lower mass and cost
* Take motors off the extruder head and onto the supports to lower mass.
