Planned obsolescence is when goods are manufactured in such a way to wear out or break very easily so that they will have to be purchased repeatedly or serviced several times.

Alternatives:
*Buying more durable goods
*Repairing broken items

One thing to bear in mind about full [[life cycle analysis|life cycle analyses]] is that older machines may work longer but may also be more inefficient. So they may ''save'' on materials and their manufacture, shipping, etc. but ''cost'' more in energy.
