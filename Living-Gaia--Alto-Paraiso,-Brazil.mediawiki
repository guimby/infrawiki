==What is Living Gaia?==
Living Gaia is a Healistic Healing Biotope which is currently in progress in Alto Pariso, Brazil. Brazil is the ideal country for Living Gaia because the body is given more attention and primacy of the mind is not devalued like in Western European Countries and life is celebrated extravagantly through music and dance in the culture.

==The Vision==
<font color="green">Love the Earth | Love yourself | Love each other</font>
The vision for Living Gaia is to build a socially and ecologically sustainable community which is inspired by its partner project, Tamera in Portugal. Just like Tamera, Living Gaia plans to provide a model for a new way of life that offers real solutions to today's problems.
