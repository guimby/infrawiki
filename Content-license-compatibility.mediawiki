In fact, the only compatible "licenses" in popular usage are ones which enable one-way compatibility:
* [[Public domain]] - not a true license, allows reuse under any terms, without restrictions.
* [[CC-BY]] - allows reuse anywhere, under any license or copyright, provided attribution is given.

One key difficulty now with sharing content is the popularity of various licenses, especially [[Creative Commons]], which are not all compatible. For example, [[NonCommercial]] and [[NoDerivatives]] clauses break compatibility with true [[open licenses]] such as [[CC-BY-SA]] (using only the the [[Attribution]] and [[ShareAlike]] clauses) as used by [[Appropedia]] and [[Wikipedia]]. 

This is unhelpful in creating a [[successful commons]], but is often an unintended consequence as the implications of these license choices are poorly understood among content creators.
