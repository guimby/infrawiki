== Greensburg, Kansas ==

In 2007 Greensburg was devastated by a tornado. After the tornado, the city council passed a resolution stating that all city buildings would be built to LEED - platinum standards, making it the first city in the nation to do so. Greensburg is rebuilding as a "green" town, with the help of Greensburg GreenTown, a non-profit organization created to help the residents learn about and implement the green living initiative. The city's power is supplied by ten 1.25 MW wind-turbines. {{W|Greensburg, Kansas}}

Wellness Weaver, a timebank, has collaborated with partners around the US to connect people who want to create a FUNctional Health and Wellness Workers Cooperative — a wellness-oriented Mutual Aid Network.

"The value of the Mutual Aid Network is to bring the wisdom and expertise of those that have used time banking formally as a way to help develop and support the best functioning Wellness Oriented Mutual Aid Network," says Helen Stucky Weaver, retired nurse and founder of Wellness Weavers. <ref>[http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-mutual-aid-network-takes-a-ground-up-approach-to-create-a-collaborative-economy Shareable]</ref>
