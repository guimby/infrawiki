The key to ''disempowering''' a person, group or [[community]] is to deny them [[participation]] in their own lives and futures, i.e. to be [[paternalism|paternalistic]], authoritarian, [[exploitation|exploitative]], or all of these. Creating [[dependency]] also disempowers.

If however your aim is [[empowerment]], you will have the more difficult job of not only avoiding being paternalistic, but actually doing less to help - even when you think you know better and you're impatient for results. You must aim to let the [[stakeholders]] choose for themselves, and find ways of supporting them and helping them to make better choices ''without making the choices for them''.
