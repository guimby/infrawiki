'''Gingko''' (''Gingko biloba'') eventually grows into a large tree, also known as "Maidenhair tree". It is a deciduous tree with a very ancient heritage as the oldest tree on Earth. It is extremely hardy, long-lived.<ref name="ces" />

It originates from China.

Gingko can tolerate drought, heat, air pollution and salt.<ref name="ces">https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/ginkgo-biloba/</ref>

== Description ==
This plant has light-green to emerald coloured leaves. The leaves form in a fan shape. In autumn, the leaves turn a rich yellow.

The female tree has seeds and fruit shaped like plums with a fleshy pulp. As it ripens, it smells foul to the human sense of smell.

The tree eventually grows to around 40 to 70 feet in height.<ref name="ces" />

== Growing gingko ==
The gingko plant can be grown in a container for many years.

It is important to choose a male plant if you're planning on planting the gingko in the garden to grow it to full tree size. Female trees produce fruits that smell bad and create a great deal of mess. As large trees, they are very costly to remove at this stage. Choose cultivated varieties.

Choose a site with full sun, although the plant can tolerate shade. It will grow in many soil types but not wet soil.<ref name="ces" />

== Uses for gingko ==
Grow as an ornamental tree; it is often grown as a street tree.

== Caution ==
The fruit is messy; the female fruit is also foul smelling.<ref name="ces" />

The juice of the seed pulp can irritate the skin, and if eaten can irritate the lips, mouth, throat and cause stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea.<ref name="ces" /> The plant contains an alkyl phenol and gingkolic acid. The seed can only be eaten after removing the outer pulp, washing it and boiling or roasting it.<ref name="ces" />

The fruit is toxic if eaten in large quantities, while skin irritation is of short duration.<ref name="ces" />
