'''Air quality''' refers to the presence or absence of [[air pollution]]. The presence of substances such as [[particulates]] or acid gases (which cause [[acid rain]]), or toxins such as [[dioxin]] can harm the health of humans and other organisms. Air pollution from human sources has increased greatly in recent centuries; however air quality can also be influenced by the release of these substances from natural sources such as [[forest fires]] and volcanoes.
