The use of [[clay]] in folk medicine goes back to prehistoric times. The indigenous peoples around the world still use it widely, which is related to [[geophagy]]. The first recorded use of medicinal clay goes back to ancient Mesopotamia. A wide variety of clays is being used for medicinal purposes - primarily for external applications, such as the clay baths in health spas ([[mud therapy]]), but also internally. Modern scientific research has backed up the healing powers of clay. Among the clays most commonly used for medicinal purposes are the [[smectite]] clays such as [[Bentonite]], [[Montmorillonite]], and [[Fuller's Earth]], and also [[kaolin]].

==Questions of nomenclature==
[[Image:Aufgearbeiteter_Ton.JPG|thumb|right|Clay is being processed by manufacturer.]]
There are considerable problems with the exact nomenclature of various clays. No clay deposit is exactly the same and, typically, mineral clays are mixed in various proportions.

Overwhelming majority of clay mined commercially is for a wide variety of industrial uses, such as in construction, and oil drilling. Thus, the precise classification and chemical composition of these clays are somewhat secondary to their intended use. For practical purposes, the terms "[[Bentonite]] clay", "[[Montmorillonite]] clay", and "[[Fuller's Earth]]" are basically interchangeable. As readily admitted in literature, the precise definition of these terms is lacking.

On the other hand, the clays that are typically used for medicinal purposes have usually been discovered either based on local folklore, or by simple trial-and-error after investigations by various healing enthusiasts. And so, their discoverers may have been either not too concerned about these clays' precise scientific classification and chemical properties, or perhaps not necessarily adequately equipped to conduct such studies. Their primary, and often only, concern was the efficacy of any particular clay for some specific medical condition or conditions.

"[[Bentonite|Sodium Bentonite]]" is the most commonly used medicinal clay today, although there is no precise definition of what this term means. In fact, typically, "Bentonite" refers to a wide spectrum of clays with a wide array of properties (such as a variety of colours). In alternative medicine, often this is used as more or less a catch-all term for medicinal clays. Another such term is "Montmorillonite", which is often interchangeable with "Bentonite". Bentonite is included in the [[United States Pharmacopeia]], and the USP-grade Bentonite is widely used in various pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations as a compounding and suspending agent. It is not entirely clear where the source of USP-grade Bentonite is located; it may be a mixture of various Bentonites.

==Self-healing by animals==

A relevant subject is how the animals - both in the wild and domesticated - seek out and consume different types of earth in general, and clay in particular (of course clay is pretty well omnipresent in variouis types of soil). 

[[Galen]], the famous Greek philosopher and physician, was the first to record the use of clay by sick or injured animals back in the second century AD. This type of [[geophagy]] has been documented in "many species of mammals, birds, reptiles, butterflies and isopods, especially among herbivores."<ref>Jared M. Diamond, [http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Diamond_99.html "Evolutionary biology: Dirty eating for healthy living".] ''Nature'' 400, 120-121 (1999)</ref>

In particular, in Peru, Amazonian rainforest parrots of some 21 species gather at certain sites on cliff faces where bare soil is exposed, and eat the clayish soil. The soil they seek is highly specific, since they focus on a rather narrow band of exposed soil. What they seek is mostly clay that is less than 0.2 millimetre in particle diameter.

==Historical use==

There is a large amount of anthropological and historical literature describing the medicinal use of clay around the world from the earliest times.

===Human prehistory===

Some scholars believe that prehistoric ancestors such as ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo neanderthalensis'' used ochres to cure wounds as well as paint caves. Ochres are a mixture of clay and iron hydroxides.

"The oldest evidence of geophagy practiced by humans comes from the prehistoric site at [[Kalambo Falls]] on the border between [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]] ([[:Robert_Root-Bernstein|Root-Bernstein]] & Root-Bernstein, 2000)." Here, a calcium-rich white clay was found alongside the bones of ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (the immediate predecessor of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'').<ref>Olle Selinus, B. J. Alloway, ''Essentials of medical geology: impacts of the natural environment on public health''. Academic Press, 2005
ISBN 0126363412, p. 446</ref>

===Use by aboriginal peoples===
[[Image:Clay formation.jpg|thumb|Sedimentary clay at Storm Point, Yellowstone National Park.]]
Clay is used widely by indigenous peoples around the world, and is related to [[geophagy]]. 

The Pomo Indians of California learned to consume bitter, and somewhat toxic acorns that grow in their area by mixing them with clay. They baked dry acorn flour with small amounts of powdered red clay. This mixture was then baked into bread, which was one of their main staples.<ref>[http://seminar.ww3ee.de/fsu05f2.lg8/Indianer/NativeAmericanTribes.htm The Indian tribes of North America]- by Magdalena Antonczyk (accessed 22 May 09)</ref> The clay reduced the bitterness of the acorns, and absorbed some of their toxins.

The same type of clay use has been reported among the indigenous peoples in the Andes Mountains of South America. A type of a local wild potato contains bitter alkaloids, so the native peoples learned to cook these bitter potatoes with clay, which made them edible.<ref>[http://www.highlightskids.com/Science/Stories/SS1201_parrotseatDirt.asp Science Stories]</ref>

===Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia===

The first recorded use of medicinal clay is on Mesopotamian clay tablets around 2500 B.C. Also, ancient Egyptians used clay.<ref>[http://researchmag.asu.edu/2007/06/healing_clay.html ASU research]</ref>

In Egypt, Cleopatra used clays to preserve her complexion. But the Pharaohs’ physicians used the material as anti-inflammatory agents and antiseptics. It was also an ingredient used for making mummies.<ref>[http://researchmag.asu.edu/2007/06/healing_clay.html ASU research]</ref>

===Classical times===

====Lemnian clay====

This was the most famous clay in Classical Antiquity. Mined on the island of [[Lemnos]], the fame of this reddish clay spread far and wide. In fact, Lemnian clay appears to have been in continuous use from the earliest antiquity to modern times. Its use continued until the 19th century, as it was still listed in an important pharmacopoeia in 1848<ref>Olle Selinus, B. J. Alloway, ''Essentials of medical geology: impacts of the natural environment on public health''. Academic Press, 2005
ISBN 0126363412, p. 446</ref> (the deposits may have been exhausted by then).

According to legend, during the Trojan war, the hero [[Philoctetes]] was stranded on Lemnos with a sick foot giving off unbearable stench (there are different versions of what may have caused the wound). He was said to have been healed by an application of the [[Lemnian Earth]].

As [[Pliny]] reports about the Lemnian Earth:
<blockquote>
"...if rubbed under the eyes, it moderates pain and watering from the same, and prevents the flow from the lachrymal ducts. In cases of haemorrhage it should be administered with vinegar. It is used against complaints of the spleen and kidneys, copious menstruation, also against poisons, and wounds caused by serpents."
</blockquote>

Lemnian clay was shaped into tablets, or little cakes, and then distinctive seals were stamped into them, giving rise to its name ''[[terra sigillata]]'' - Latin for 'sealed earth'. [[Dioscorides]] also commented upon the use of ''terra sigillata''.<ref>Olle Selinus, B. J. Alloway, ''Essentials of medical geology: impacts of the natural environment on public health''. Academic Press, 2005
ISBN 0126363412, p. 446</ref>

Another physician famous in antiquity, [[Galen]], recorded numerous cases of the internal and external uses of this clay in his treatise on clay therapy.
<blockquote>
"Galen... used as one of his means for curing injuries, festering wounds, and inflammations ''terra sigillata'', a medicinal red clay compressed into round cakes and stamped with the image of the goddess Diana. This clay, which came from the island of Lemnos, was known throughout the classical world."<ref>Dr. H. Van Der Loos, ''The Miracles of Jesus'', Leiden, the Netherlands, Brill, 1965. p. 82.
</ref></blockquote>
Clay was prescribed by the Roman obstetrician, gynecologist, and pediatrician [[Soranus of Ephesus]], who practiced medicine around 100-140 AD.

====Other clays used in classical times====

The other types of clay that were famous in antiquity were as follows.

* ''Terra chia, Terra cymolia'' (Cimolean earth): these were both white earths and considered of great value.

* Samian earth: Pliny in c. 50 AD (Nat. Hist.) details two distinct varieties, ''colyrium'' - an eye salve, and ''aster'', which was used as a soap as well as in medicines. 

* ''Terra sigillata strigoniensis'' (Strigian earth, derived from [[Silesia]]) - this clay, yellow in colour, appears to have been famous later in medieval times.

All the above seem to have been bentonitic clays. 

* The earth which did not stain the hands was known as ''rubrica''.

===Medieval times===

In medieval Persia, [[Avicenna]] (980-1037 CE), the 'Prince of Doctors', wrote about clay therapy in his numerous treatises.  

[[Ibn al-Baitar]] (1197-1248), an Arabic scholar born at Malaga, Spain, and author of a famous work on pharmacology, discusses eight kinds of medicinal earth.<ref>L. Leclerc, "Traite des simples", II, 1881, pp. 421-427; for a general appreciation of this work see Baron Carra de Vaux, "Les penseurs de lslam", II, 1921, pp. 289-296 (original note in Laufer)</ref> The eight kinds are:

# the ''terra sigillata'', 
# Egyptian earth, 
# Samian earth, 
# earth of Chios, 
# Cimolean earth or pure clay (cimolite), soft earth, called ''al-hurr'', green in color like verdigris, is smoked together with almond bark to serve as food when it will turn red and assume a good flavor; it is but rarely eaten without being smoked - also called 'Argentiera',
# earth of vines called ''ampelitis'' (Pliny XXXV, 56) or ''pharmakitis'' from Seleucia in Syria, 
# Armenian earth, salutary in cases of bubonic plague, being administered both externally and internally,
# earth of Nishapur.<ref>Laufer, Berthold, "Geophagy". Chicago: Field Museum Press, 1930. [http://www.archive.org/stream/geophagy182lauf/geophagy182lauf_djvu.txt (available online)]</ref>

===Renaissance period, and up to the present===

A French naturalist [[Pierre Belon]] (1517‑1564) was interested in investigating the mystery of the Lemnian clay. In 1543, he visited Constantinople where, after making enquiries, he encountered 18 types of different products marketed as Lemnian Earth (he was concerned about possible counterfeits). He then made a special journey to Lemnos, where he continued his investigation, and tried to find the source of the clay. He discovered that it was extracted only once a year (on the 6th of August) under the supervision of Christian monks and Turkish officials.

Modern investigation has shown that this was a clay similar to the modern 'bentonite'.

==Preparation of clay==

Clay gathered from its original source deposit is refined and processed in various ways by manufacturers. This can include heating or baking the clay. Some practitioners insist that raw clay (as close to its original state as possible) has the best therapeutic effect.<ref>"For clay baths, the experts agree that clean, raw, natural swelling smectite clays are the best. This includes swelling bentonites and montmorillonites." [http://www.aboutclay.com/info/Articles/clay_baths.htm from Aboutclay.com website] (accessed 16 June 2009)</ref> This is because the raw clay also tends to contain a variety of micro-organisms that may contribute to healing."<ref>"Soil, including kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays, contains considerable amounts of organic material, including many live microorganisms."
[http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no8/03-0033.htm from CDC.gov website]Callahan GN. ''Eating dirt.'' Emerg Infect Dis [serial online] 2003 Aug. (accessed 16 June 2009)</ref> Heating the clay may destroy those micro-organisms.

Too much processing, likewise, may reduce the clay's therapeutic potential. In particular, Mascolo et al. studied 'pharmaceutical grade clay' versus 'the natural and the commercial herbalist clay', and found an appreciable depletion of trace elements in the pharmaceutical grade clay.<ref>"The pharmaceutical clay shows an appreciable depletion of elements as Zn, V, Ga, Cr, Cd, Fe, Mo, Ni, Cu, Sb, S and Rb. Instead, the natural clay is characterised by high quantities of U, V, Cd, Mo, Tl, Ag, Ni, Cu, Sb, As, S, Se and Br, likely because of sulphide occurrence." -- Nicola Mascolo, Vito Summa, F. Tateo, ''Characterization of toxic elements in clays for human healing use''. Applied Clay Science, Volume 15, Issues 5-6, 1999
[[doi:10.1016/S0169-1317(99)00037-X]]
</ref> On the other hand, certain clays are typically heated or cooked before use.<ref> An example of this is the medieval 'Argentiera' clay, mentioned in this article.</ref>

Medicinal clay is typically available in health food stores as a dry powder, or in jars in its liquid hydrated state - which is convenient for internal use. For external use, the clay may be added to the bath, or prepared in wet packs or poultices for application to specific parts of the body. Often, warm packs are prepared; the heat opens up the pores of the skin, and helps the interaction of the clay with the body.<ref>"Hot application is recommended in geotherapy, pelotherapy or paramuds in beauty therapy..." Carretaro MI, Gomes CSF, Tateo F. "Clays and human health." In: Bergaya F, Theng BKG, Lagaly G, editors. ''Handbook of Clay Science, Developments in Clay Science''. Vol. 1. Elsevier Ltd; Amsterdam: 2006. pp. 717–741. ISBN 0080441831 p. 723</ref>

In the European health spas, the clay is prepared for use in a multitude of ways - depending on the traditions of a particular spa; typically it is mixed with peat and matured in special pools for a few months or even up to two years.
<blockquote>
"The majority of spas ... use artificial ponds where the natural ("virgin") clay is mixed with mineral, thermo-mineral, or sea water that issues in the vicinity of the spas or inside the spa buildings."<ref>Carretaro MI, Gomes CSF, Tateo F. "Clays and human health." In: Bergaya F, Theng BKG, Lagaly G, editors. ''Handbook of Clay Science, Developments in Clay Science''. Vol. 1. Elsevier Ltd; Amsterdam: 2006. pp. 717–741. ISBN 0080441831, ISBN 9780080441832 p. 724</ref>

==Medicinal properties of clay in modern research==

===Absorptive and adsorptive properties of clays===

====Absorption====
[[Image:Clay_magnified.jpg|thumb|Scanning electron microscope photograph of smectite clay from Tuckup Canyon - U.S. Geological Survey - magnification 23,500.]]
Clay demonstrates its absorptive properties by acting like a sponge; it draws various toxic substances into its internal multi-layered structure. The clay expands as the absorbed substance fills the spaces between its stacked silicate layers.

====Adsorption====

The clay's mineral surfaces are negatively charged (i.e. they possess negative electrical charges), which attracts the positively charged toxins, such as the heavy metal ions. An exchange reaction then occurs; the clay swaps its ions for the heavy metal ions.

===Detoxifying properties===

The above processes contribute to the detoxifying properties that the medicinal clays exhibit. Also, see below.

===Antibacterial properties===

In a recent article in ''The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy'', Haydel et al. studied iron-rich [[smectite]] and [[illite]] clay (Montmorillonite/Bentonite type of clay), and found that it was effective in killing bacteria ''[[in vitro]]''.<ref>Dec 10, 2007. [http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/61/2/353 ''Broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens''] (accessed 31 March 2009)</ref> Authors report that the clay mineral,
<blockquote>
"...exhibits bactericidal activity against ''E. coli'', ESBL [Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases] ''E. coli, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa'', and ''M. marinum'', and significantly reduces growth of ''S. aureus'', PRSA, MRSA, and nonpathogenic ''M. smegmatis'' approximately 1,000-fold compared to cultures grown without added mineral products."<ref>[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2413170 full text of the article]</ref></blockquote>

In a more recent study funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]], Williams, Haydel, et al. collected more than 20 different clay samples from around the world, including the bentonite-type clays, to investigate their antibacterial activities.<ref>Apr 7, 2008. [http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/news/healing-clays-hold-promise-in-fight-against-mrsa-superbug-infections-and-disease ''“Healing clays” hold promise in fight against MRSA superbug infections and disease''.] (accessed 31 March 2009)</ref> The authors report that they have achieved promising results against [[MRSA]] superbug infections and disease. Also, see below.

===Trace minerals===

Clays contain massive amounts of trace minerals, necessary for good health. (It is common to see 60 different trace minerals and more in various clays.) This may explain many of the healing properties of clay. Specific trace minerals that various clays possess vary very widely. Also, the amount of any particular trace mineral in any specific clay varies a lot among different clays. For example, the amount of [[iron]] in various bentonite clays can vary from well below 1%, and up to 10%.

===External use===


====Mud baths====
[[Image:First Rain (228226305).jpg|thumb|Playing with the clay is a lot of fun.]]
This is perhaps the most common use of clay. Just about all health spas around the world use clay on a daily basis, and report many health benefits for bathers. See [[mud bath]]s.

====Skin infections====

Many types of skin infections have been healed by the application of medicinal clay. Clay is used in many over the counter medicines for this purpose.

=====Buruli ulcer=====

This flesh-eating bacterial disease is found primarily in central and western Africa.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has described [[Buruli ulcer]] as "an emerging public health threat". The disease is caused by the bacterium ''Mycobacterium ulcerans'' - which is related to the micro-organisms that also cause leprosy and tuberculosis. This bacterium produces a powerful toxin that causes necrotic lesions, and destroys the fatty tissues under the skin. 

The toxin produced by the bacteria suppresses the immune system, so patients feel no pain, and there is no response from the body to the infection. The disease is quite similar to leprosy. The commonly accepted treatments, which include antibiotics and surgical intervention, have not been very effective.

(Antibiotics currently play little part in the treatment of this disease. [[Wide local excision|Surgical excision]] can be effective if undertaken early, yet it leaves scars, and can be dangerous. Advanced disease may require prolonged treatment with extensive skin grafting. Thus, such treatment is expensive, and may be difficult to obtain in third world conditions.)

Two French medicinal clays have shown some remarkable results against this disease. Dr Lynda Williams and Dr Shelley Haydel of Arizona State University have been studying the effectiveness of these French green clays, which are mostly composed of minerals called smectite and illite. These clays exhibit significant antibacterial properties.<ref>Margaret Coulombe, [http://researchstories.asu.edu/2007/06/healing_clay.html "Healing Clay"] Arizona State University website</ref>

====Use in bandages====

In April 2008, the [[Naval Medical Research Center]] announced the successful use of a Kaolinite-derived [[aluminosilicate]] [[nanoparticles]] infusion in traditional [[gauze]] known commercially as "QuikClot Combat Gauze".<ref>[http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2008/04/blood_clotting Nanoparticles Help Gauze Stop Gushing Wounds]</ref> 

===Internal use===

According to one theory, 

<blockquote>
"In the stomach, the negative electrical charges of tiny clay particles attract positively charged toxins from stomach fluids. This clumping prevents very small particles, such as toxic molecules, from passing through the walls of the intestines and entering the bloodstream."<ref>[http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html Suzanne Ubick, "Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud"], in ''California Wild'', The Magazine of the California Academy of Sciences, 2005</ref>
</blockquote>

The author notes further that, together with the clay, the toxins are then eliminated harmlessly out of the body through the kidneys or bowel.

There are many over the counter remedies for internal use that contain clay. The examples are the tablets such as [[Kaopectate]] (Upjohn), Rheaban (Leeming Div., Pfizer), and Diar-Aid (Thompson Medical Co.). The labels on all of these showed the active ingredient to be [[Attapulgite]], each tablet containing 600 (or 750 mg) of this component along with inert materials or adjuvants.<ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5079201.html U.S. Patent 5079201]</ref>

Numerous medicines also use [[Kaolinite]] clay, which has long been a traditional remedy to soothe an upset stomach. Also, Kaolin is or has been used as the active substance in liquid anti-diarrhea medicines such as Kaomagma. Such medicines were changed away from aluminium substances due to a scare over Alzheimer's disease, but have since changed back to compounds containing aluminium as they are most effective.

====Anti-diarrheal properties====

In addition to the above clays, also [[Diosmectite]] clay is valued in medicine for its anti-diarrheal effects. [[Diosmectite]] is a type of a [[smectite]] clay. It is described as a natural silicate of aluminium and magnesium, so it is magnesium-rich. It has strong adsorbent properties, so it's used as an intestinal adsorbent in the treatment of several gastrointestinal diseases, including diarrhea. Basically, this seems to be another trade name for Bentonite-type clay.

According to a recent review article,

<blockquote>
"Diosmectite reduces inflammation, modifies mucus rheologic properties, inhibits mucolysis, and adsorbs bacteria, bacterial enterotoxins, viruses and other potentially diarrheogenic substances."<ref>Dupont, Christophe; Vernisse, Bernard, ''Anti-Diarrheal Effects of Diosmectite in the Treatment of Acute Diarrhea in Children: A Review''. Pediatric Drugs: 1 April 2009 - Volume 11 - Issue 2 - pp 89-99 [[doi:10.2165/00148581-200911020-00001]]
</ref>
</blockquote>

The same authors cite a number of studies showing that diosmectite is effective against diarrhea in children with mild-to-moderate acute symptoms. It reduces the duration of illness, and decreases the frequency of bowel motions after 2 days of treatment. No serious adverse effects have been observed.

In 2001, an Italian study examined the anti-diarrheal effects of a clay described as 'smectite', and also found positive results.<ref>Guarino A, Bisceglia M, Castellucci G, Iacono G, Casali LG, Bruzzese E, Musetta A, Greco L, ''Smectite in the treatment of acute diarrhea: a nationwide randomized controlled study of the Italian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology (SIGEP) in collaboration with primary care pediatricians. SIGEP Study Group for Smectite in Acute Diarrhea.'' J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2001 Jan;32(1):71-5. PMID 11176329</ref> The authors conclude that "smectite reduces the duration of diarrhea and prevents a prolonged course." They also note that smectite clay increases intestinal barrier function.

====Candida====

Clays have proven to be effective against the ''[[Candida albicans]]'' infections. This is a type of a fungus (or yeast), which is a causal agent of opportunistic oral and genital infections. This type of infection, known as [[Candidiasis]], also may enter the bloodstream, and become a systemic ''Candida'' infection.

In 1971, the influence of bentonite clay on the growth of ''[[Candida lipolytica]]'' has been studied by Maignan and Pareilleux. A clearly unfavorable effect of bentonite on ''Candida lipolytica'' growth was observed <ref>Maignan C and Pareilleux A, Influence of bentonite on the growth of Candida lipolytica. ''Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des seances de l'Academie des sciences. Serie D: Sciences naturelles'' 273(9):835-8, 1971 Aug 30</ref>

Later on, the same authors have concluded that,
<blockquote>
"The respiration of ''Candida lipolytica'' on n-tetradecane is decreased in the presence of bentonite."<ref>Pareilleux A, Maignan C., Can J Microbiol. 1976 Aug;22(8):1065-71. [Metabolic activity of Candida lipolytica adsorbed to bentonite with hydrophobic chains] [Article in French][http://rparticle.web-p.cisti.nrc.ca/rparticle/AbstractTemplateServlet?calyLang=eng&journal=cjm&volume=22&year=0&issue=8&msno=m76-157 abstract and a link to full text]</ref></blockquote>

According to a 2009 study by Ghiaci et al., bentonite clay acts very strongly against ''Candida'':
<blockquote>
"The modified bentonite with monolayer surfactant (BMS), was the best support, for immobilization."<ref>M. Ghiaci, H. Aghaei, S. Soleimanian, M.E. Sedaghat S, "Enzyme immobilization: Part 1. Modified bentonite as a new and efficient support for immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase." ''Applied Clay Science'', Volume 43, Issues 3-4, March 2009, Pages 289-295</ref></blockquote>

====Heavy metal chelation====

[[Chelation]] (purging) of heavy metals from the body has been a very effective way to treat many illnesses. [[Chelation therapy]] is the use of chelating agents to detoxify poisonous metal agents such as mercury, arsenic, and lead by converting them to a chemically inert form that can be excreted without further interaction with the body, and has been approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] in 1991.

Clay has proven to be a very effective chelating agent.

Oyanedel-Craver and Smith have studied sorption of four heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg) to 3 kinds of bentonite clay. The overall conclusion of the study was that the organoclays studied have considerable capacity for heavy metal sorption.<ref>Oyanedel-Craver VA, Smith JA, "Effect of quaternary ammonium cation loading and pH on heavy metal sorption to Ca bentonite and two organobentonites". ''J Hazard Mater'' 2006; 137:1102-14.</ref>

====Irritable bowel syndrome====

"[B]eidellitic montmorillonite is efficient for C-IBS patients (suffering from constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome)..."<ref>Ducrotte P, Dapoigny M, Bonaz B, Siproudhis L. "Symptomatic efficacy of beidellitic montmorillonite in irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, controlled trial". ''Aliment Pharmacol Ther.'' 2005 Feb 15;21(4):435-44. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15709995 available online]</ref>

====Aflatoxicosis====

[[Aflatoxins]] are naturally occurring mycotoxins that are produced by many species of Aspergillus, a fungus. Aflatoxins are toxic and among the most carcinogenic substances known. They cause  Aflatoxicosis, which can afflict both animals and humans.

Bentonite clay has proven to show a very strong protective effect against Aflatoxicosis.
<blockquote>
"The addition of bentonite or HSCAS [hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate] to the AF-contaminated diet diminished most of the deleterious effects of the aflatoxin. Pathological examinations of liver and kidney proved that both bentonite and HSCAS were hepatonephroprotective agents against aflatoxicosis."<ref>M A Abdel-Wahhab, S A Nada, I M Farag, N F Abbas, H A Amra, "Potential protective effect of HSCAS and bentonite against dietary aflatoxicosis in rat: with special reference to chromosomal aberrations." ''Nat Toxins'' - 1998 (Vol. 6, Issue 5, Pages 211-8)</ref></blockquote>

Also, 
<blockquote>
"The addition of sodium bentonite was significantly effective in ameliorating the negative effect of aflatoxicosis on the percentage and mean of phagocytosis."<ref>I. K. IBRAHIM, A. M. SHAREEF, K. M. T. AL-JOUBORY, "Ameliorative effects of sodium bentonite on phagocytosis and Newcastle disease antibody formation in broiler chickens during aflatoxicosis". ''Research in Veterinary Science'', Volume 69, Issue 2, October 2000, Pages 119-122</ref>
</blockquote>

====Use during pregnancy====

Pregnant women in many indigenous and traditional cultures very commonly consume clay, especially to reduce nausea. Since clays contain a very large amount of trace minerals of all sorts, this most likely contributes to the development of a healthy foetus.

Scientific analyses of clays selected by pregnant women in Nigeria show that eating as little as 500 mg (about the equivalent of two Tylenol capsules) per day can satisfy nearly 80 percent of a pregnant woman's calcium needs.<ref>[http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html Suzanne Ubick, "Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud"], in ''California Wild'', The Magazine of the CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, 2005</ref> 

====Use by the NASA Space Program====
[[Image:Sedimentary-clay-mountain.jpg|thumb|A mountain of clay -- Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona. The white bands represent pure bentonite clay.]]
The effects of weightlessness on human body were studied by [[NASA]] back in the 1960s.  Experiments demonstrated that weightlessness leads to a rapid bone depletion, so various remedies were sought to counter that. A number of pharmaceutical companies were asked to develop calcium supplements, but apparently none of them were as effective as clay. The special clay that was used in this case was Terramin, a reddish clay found in California. Dr. Benjamin Ershoff of the California Polytechnic Institute demonstrated that the consumption of clay counters the effects of weightlessness. He reported that "the calcium in clay ...is absorbed more efficiently ... [clay] contains some factor or factors other than calcium which promotes improved calcium utilization and/or bone formation." He added, "Little or no benefit was noted when calcium alone was added to the diet."<ref>[http://research.calacademy.org/calwild/2005winter/stories/mud.html Suzanne Ubick, "Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud"], in ''California Wild'', The Magazine of the CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, 2005</ref>

==Most commonly used medicinal clays== 

* [[Bentonite]]
Bentonite-type clay has been used to treat infections, indigestion, and other medical problems by both applying wet clay topically to the skin as a [[poultice]], and by ingesting it.

Bentonite has been prescribed as a bulk laxative, and it is also used as a base for many dermatologic formulas.<ref>[http://food.oregonstate.edu/glossary/b/bentonite.html Bentonite] from oregonstate.edu website</ref> Dermatologically, it is used as part of a treatment for [[pruritis]].<ref>[http://www.drugs.com/mmx/calamine.html Calamine] from www.drugs.com website</ref> Also, Bentonite can be used as a therapeutic face pack for the treatment of [[acne]]/oily skin. [[Clearasil]], an acne cream, uses bentonite as an agent to absorb excess [[sebum]], clearing pores.
