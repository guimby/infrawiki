Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is used to support newborn babies with serious respiratory problems. CPAP is not normally available in low-middle income countries as it requires high flow levels of oxygen and air that are costly to provide. The Diamedica Baby CPAP is an oxygen concentrator-driven bubble CPAP system for use in areas with limited resources. This solution provides controllable, safe CPAP with minimal running costs.
