=='''Introduction'''==
When cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar, a country located in the Southeast of Asia, on May, 2. 2008 it left the country devastated. Due to climate changes farmer's had a difficult time attempting to rebuild their economy and faced many challenges. Global Changemakers[http://www.global-changemakers.net/projects/go-green-myanmar/]Souls Foundation[http://www.kingstoncorp.com/souls/green_souls.htm] and Water, Research and Training Center-Myanmar[http://www.wrtcmyan.org/activities/ever-green-hardwood-mango-trees-planting-in-myanmar/] came to the rescue to lessen the farmer's burdens. They planted over 660 mango trees that will eventually be economically profitable. When the trees were being planted, many children around the community helped, giving them the opportunity to learn more about the environment and sustainable development.[[File:Cyclone nargis.jpg|left|Fig 1.

=='''Benefits of Mango and Mango Tree'''==
Mangoes are known as being, "The King of Asiatic Fruits," and have numerous benefits other then being a delicious tropical fruit used for food and drinks. A mango has medicinal uses when it is both unripe or ripe.

The mango wood itself is very sustainable. The wood is hard making it very durable, and comes in a variety of shades ranging anywhere from light to dark. Thus, making it desirable for furniture pieces like: benches, tables, kitchen cabinets, entertainment centers and bookshelves. Above all, "Manufacturing of wood products provides additional revenue for mango farmers, supporting the local community," says Pure, Green, Simple blog[http://momsshoppinglist.com/blog/2011/02/23/what-makes-mango-wood-sustainable/].
 
Roughly, the mango tree can grow as tall as 120 feet with a radius of 33 feet. The trees give shade to the community when temperatures in Myanmar on average, reach about 95 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.


=='''How to Plant a Mango Tree'''==
Luckily, planting a mango tree is simple and keeping it healthy requires little maintenance. Mango trees smell nice too. "The trees begin to produce fruit four to six years after planting and continue bearing fruit for about 40 years. To set fruit and produce a successful crop, the trees require tropical areas with defined seasons and a hot dry period typical of India and Southeast Asia where there are monsoon seasons followed by dry seasons," says Vegetarians in Paradise website[http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch37.html].[[File:Mango tree.jpg|thumb|left|Fig 3.

First, you decide if you want to buy a mango tree or grow a mango tree from seed. It takes a shorter amount of time for a mango tree to bear fruit if it is bought, and a longer time to bear fruit if it is being grown from a seed.

Second, if you grow a mango tree from seed, look for seeds that come from a polyembryonic category. Plant the seeds at the beginning of the summer in a wet or moist place that will get plenty of sunlight. Except for one, cut off seedlings. Typically, it takes ten days for the seed to sprout. 

Third, when planting a mango tree, "a good way of helping the tree is foliar spraying with fish fertilizer or seaweed solution," says Tropical Permaculture[http://www.tropicalpermaculture.com/growing-mangoes.html]. When tree reaches one meter, cut off branches for a nice tree shape.
