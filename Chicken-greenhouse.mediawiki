The '''chicken greenhouse''' is a design concept proposed by [[Bill Mollison]] and frequently mentioned in permaculture literature and courses. It is a combination of chicken coop and greenhouse. Body heat from the chickens would serve to heat the greenhouse during cold weather. Thus it is often used as an example to illustrate [[permaculture principles]] such as stacking functions. Despite the spread of the concept, there are few known attempts to build a chicken greenhouse.
