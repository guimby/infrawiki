A major goal of [[Potawot]] is to be sustainable. This includes natural storm water treatment and responsible resource management. Potawot uses [[swales]] as a part of the treatment system to manage and treat runoff.

Specifically, Potawot uses [[bioswales]], which include vegetation. Bioswales decrease the speed of water flow, provide a containment area for runoff, and encourage suspended solids to settle out of the water. The plants in a bioswale filter pollutants and contain and decompose them in the soil. <ref>Groves, William, Phillip Hammer, Karinne Knutsen, Sheila Ryan, and Robert Schlipf.

Runoff." October 28, 2008. [http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/research/Finaldocs/1999/bioswale.pdf]</ref>

The swales are one part of the larger natural water treatment system at Potawot. The swales treat the runoff by filtering out pollution. Once the water passes through the swales, it empties into the treatment pond.

The swales are one aspect of Potawot’s commitment to sustainable resource usage. Instead of allowing runoff to become a waste, Potawot has a method to utilize runoff to assist another of Potawot's main goals: to preserve the natural habitat. The swales create an ideal area for native plant growth. <ref name="Eric Johnson">Johnson, Eric. Interview. October 27, 2008.</ref>

== Locations ==
[[Image:KRA_map_RAIN_flat_label.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 1: Diagram of Potawot's waterflow. Notice the swales in the parking lots. Image is courtesy of Eric Johnson.]]

The swales are positioned at the Potawot grounds to collect excess runoff from the parking lots. Designed to use gravity to transport the water, they are connected to each other by culverts and form a system to channel runoff into the treatment pond. 

The swales are located near Potawot’s parking lots. In Figure 1, they are represented by the green areas within the parking lots. They are placed there because non-soil surfaces such as concrete generate large amounts of runoff. Water is unable to penetrate these materials and [[percolate]] into the ground during rains.<ref name="Eric Johnson"/>
Percolation is the movement of a liquid, in this case storm water, through porous materials, such as the soil of the bottom of the swales.

== Function/Treatment ==
As part of Potawot's storm water treatment system, the swales are designed to maximize the natural treatment of the water. Like all bioswales, the swales have a fairly low grade, in order to slow the water as it travels. This encourages water to collect for extended periods of time, because the longer the water remains, the more percolates into the ground. Much of the water travels in the subsurface, or below the top layer of soil. The soil used swales is permeable, which means fluids easily pass through it, and contains high levels of organic materials. <ref>"Vegetated Swale" October 28, 2008. [http://www.tredyffrin.org/pdf/publicworks/CH2%20-%20BMP2%20Vegetated%20Swale.pdf]</ref> This promotes the filtering of sediments and pollutants such as metals from the storm water <ref>"Bioswales Article May 2007" October 28, 2008. [http://www.openlands.org/reports/BioswalesArticleMay2007.pdf]</ref>.

The water levels in the swales are designed to be shallow. They are 1-2 inches deep during an average rainfall and 5-6 inches deep at maximum capacity.

=== Native Vegetation ===

Native plants and shrubs are deliberately planted and encouraged to grow in the swales.

These plants assist the filtering process by breaking down pollutants and help collect the water in the ground through their roots. Some of these plants have rhizomes, which are underground stems that grow roots and shoots. Additionally, the plants support the larger aim of Potawot to encourage native habitat renewal. <ref name="Eric Johnson">Johnson, Eric. Interview. October 27, 2008.</ref>

The species of plants chosen to grow in the swales are:

* Scirpus microcarpus - Small-fruited Bulrush
* Cornus sericea var. stolonifera - Red-twig Dogwood
* Juncus effuses - Juncus
* Deschampsia cespitosa - Tuft Hairgrass
* Alnus rubra – Red Alder
* Acer circinatum – Vine maple
* Salix – Willow
* Carex obnupta – Slough sedge

== Maintenance ==
The swales require a mild amount of upkeep to remain functional. This consists of ensuring flow by manually unclogging the culverts and maintaining the grade of the swales. Nonnative, invasive, and dead plants are removed to allow the native plants to grow. Soil is replaced if it has worn away. <ref name="Eric Johnson"/>

==Update October 2013==
As of 2013 the Potawat swales have been a success in diverting storm water and recreating a wetland habitat. Issues have occurred however because of too much biomass buildup in some parts preventing water to flow downward to the ponds in times of a storm surge. Swales are very permeable making them attractive around pavement, they allow a reduction in urban runoff and prevent flooding often associated with storm surges.

==Update October 2014==
As of 2014 the Potawat swales have continued to be successful in diverting storm water and recreating a wetland habitat. However the issues of biomass buildup still persist in parts of the swales, during a rainy day water flow downward to the ponds can be slow. Overall, the swales seemed to function well while it was raining on the day of the update, preventing flooding and reducing runoff.
