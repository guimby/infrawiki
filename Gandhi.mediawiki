Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led [[India]] to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma — applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa, — is now used worldwide. He is also called Bapu in India. His birthday, 2 October, is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and world-wide as the International Day of Nonviolence. {{W|Mahatma Gandhi}}
