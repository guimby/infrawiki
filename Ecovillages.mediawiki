{{topic header| default.png |Ecovillages}}

'''Ecovillages''' are a kind of sustainable [[neighbourhood]], which are typically planned and managed cooperatively. They are intended to be socially, economically and ecologically [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[intentional communities]]<ref>[http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/2000/08ecovillage.php What Is  Ecovillage? by Tony Sirna]</ref><ref>[http://www.ic.org/pnp/cdir/1995/20arkin.php An Ecovillage Retrofit for Los Angeles: Healing an Inner-City Neighborhood by Lois Arkin]</ref> - though they include models that may be less intense and offer more privacy than some intentional communities. Compared to [[sustainable cities]], they are smaller and typically aim for a population of no more than 50-150 individuals, which is considered to be the maximum [[social network]] according to findings from [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] (Hill & Dunbar, 2002). Larger ecovillages of up to 2,000 individuals may, however, exist as networks of smaller "''ecomunicipalities''" or subcommunities to create an ecovillage model that allows for social networks within a broader foundation of support.

Ecovillage members are united by shared [[ecological]], social or spiritual values (''see'' [[Intentional community]]).  An ecovillage is often composed of people who have chosen an alternative to centralized power, water, and sewage systems.  Many see the breakdown of traditional forms of community, wasteful [[consumerism|consumerist]] lifestyles, the destruction of natural habitat, urban sprawl, factory farming, and over-reliance on fossil fuels, as trends that must be changed to avert ecological disaster.  They see small-scale communities with minimal ecological impact as an alternative.  However, such communities often cooperate with peer villages in networks of their own (''see'' [[Global Ecovillage Network]] for an example).  This model of collective action is similar to that of [[Ten Thousand Villages]], which supports the [[fair trade]] of goods worldwide.

==Definition==
In 1991, [[Robert Gilman]] set out a definition of an ecovillage that was to become a standard.  Gilman defined an ecovillage as a settlement:
* which is [[human-scale]]
* which is full-featured 
* in which human activities are harmlessly integrated into the natural world
* in a way that is supportive of healthy human development, and 
* which can be successfully continued into the indefinite future.[http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Gilman1.htm ] 

Note: In recent years, Gilman has stated that he would also add the criterion that an ecovillage must have ''multiple centers of initiative''.  

==Ecomunicipalities explained==

An '''eco-municipality''', (also known as '''eco-town''') is a [[local government]] government that has adopted [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]].  The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.<ref>http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 accessed on Nov 5, 2007 at 2:24pm CST</ref>  The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall [[sustainability]] of the community. 

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] & [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government.  Many eco-municipality projects also incorporate the [[Natural Step]] into their change processes.<ref>http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf</ref>

===History of ecomunicipalities===
In 1983 the Övertorneä community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municpality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM). 

==Characteristics of ecovillages==
The principles on which ecovillages rely can be applied to [[urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] settings, as well as to developing and developed countries. Advocates seek infrastructural independence and a sustainable lifestyle (for example, of [[voluntary simplicity]]) for inhabitants with a minimum of trade outside the local area, or [[ecoregion]].  Rural ecovillages are usually based on [[organic farming]], [[permaculture]] and other approaches which promote [[ecosystem]] function and [[biodiversity]].  Some ecovillages integrate many of the design principles of [[cohousing]], but with a greater ecological focus and a more "organic" process, typical of permaculture design.       

An ecovillage usually relies on:
* "[[green economics|Green]]" [[infrastructural capital]];
*[[autonomous building]] or clustered housing, to minimize [[ecological footprint]];
*[[renewable energy]];
*[[permaculture]];
*[[cohousing]] or other forms of supportive community.

The goal of most ecovillages is to be a [[sustainable habitat]] providing for most of its needs on site. Its organization also usually depends upon some [[instructional capital]] or [[moral code]]s - a minimal [[civics]] sometimes characterized as [[eco-anarchism]]:
*[[local purchasing]] so as to support the local economy; 
*[[local food]] production and distribution;
*[[moral purchasing]] to avoid objectionable [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]; 
*[[consensus decision-making]] for governance;
*a choice to [[respect diversity]].

The term ''ecovillage'' should not be confused with [[micronation]], a strictly legal, not infrastructural, concept.
