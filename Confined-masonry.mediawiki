[[Confined masonry]], if built correctly, performs very well in earthquakes. 

It uses the same materials found in reinforced concrete frame[[masonry]] construction, i.e. concrete and brick. However it uses a different construction sequence and design. 

In the reinforced concrete frame[[masonry]] the RC frame carries the seismic load and the bricks are simply infill. In confined masonry ([[brick]] and [[mortar]]) walls carry the seismic loads and reinforced concrete is used to confine the walls. 

It is claimed that  well-constructed confined masonry buildings have been observed to incur little or no damage in moderate to even severe earthquakes.
