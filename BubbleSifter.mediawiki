== Concrete Durability ==

The durability of portland [[cement]] concrete in cold weather climates where freezing and thawing takes place is largely determined by the nature of the air void system in the cement paste matrix that binds the concrete together.

This entry will hopefully become the communication and knowledge dissemination hub for an [[open source software]] solution to measuring air void parameters in hardened [[concrete]].
