=Definition from http://www.triz40.com/aff_Principles_TRIZ.php=
If it will be necessary to do an action with both harmful and useful effects, this action should be replaced with anti-actions to control harmful effects.
• Buffer a solution to prevent harm from extremes of pH.

Create beforehand stresses in an object that will oppose known undesirable working stresses later on.
• Pre-stress rebar before pouring concrete.
• Masking anything before harmful exposure: Use a lead apron on parts of the body not being exposed to X-rays. Use masking tape to protect the part of an object not being painted

This principle is proposed to solve the following contradictions:
