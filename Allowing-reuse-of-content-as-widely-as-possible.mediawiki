If you want to allow [[reuse]] of your [[open content]] as widely as possible, with attribution, the options are:
* [[Public domain]]: you give up all rights including [[attribution]].
* [[CC-BY]]: this requires attribution, but doesn't give the [[ShareAlike]] protection against it being used, modified and copyrighted. If someone modifies it and doesn't share back, you can't freely use the adapted work). 
* Dual license of [[CC-BY-SA]] and [[CC-BY-NC-SA]]. '''Note: This is the most complex option, and you need to word your permissions statement carefully.'''<ref>It is comparable in structure to [[Wikipedia:Project:Copyrights|Wikipedia's dual-license of CC-BY-SA plus GFDL]] - which was considered undesirable by some, but which was considered important due to Wikimedia's relicensing agreement with the [[Free Software Foundation]], which allowed them to move to CC-BY-SA.</ref> '''If at all unclear, then a simple [[CC-BY-SA]] is probably the wiser option.''' This option means that blogs or other sites using CC-BY-NC-SA can use your work - however you still can't use theirs if (for example) your site is commercial, or otherwise conflicts with [the conditions of the noncommercial clause]. If you want to be able to freely use content from other sites (other than only public domain or CC-BY), you will need to specify CC-BY-SA as your primary license, and say on your license page that all original content on the site is under both licenses, but if any CC-BY-SA content is used in a post, then that content is under the CC-BY-SA license only.
