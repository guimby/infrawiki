A '''scrubber''' is an [[air pollution]] control system. 

Scrubbers are used in the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from [[flue gases]]. They are also used for removing [[carbon dioxide]] as part of certain variations of [[carbon capture and storage]]. 

In a scrubber, the flue gases flow through a water solution spray forcing onto a slurrie of lime or limestone which react with SO2 to form solids which can be removed later.
