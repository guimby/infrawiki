http://www.hamiltonpermacultureguild.org/

We are an open network of people from Hamilton (Ontario, Canada) and surrounding areas acting to honor, share and expand the ideas and practice of Permaculture; to regenerate the health of the land and its inhabitants; for a just and resilient future. 

We work towards this through nurturing resilient connections with ourselves, each other, our families, our local and global communities, other organizations, and our living planet Earth. 

No prior knowledge of Permaculture needed. Please participate. All visitors and newcomers welcome :)
