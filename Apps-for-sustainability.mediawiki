== Guidelines for listings ==
[[File:Apps4s2.jpg|left|50px]]
The listings here are intended to concentrate on the apps which make it easier for citizens and community groups to take action for [[sustainability]]. So they are by nature citizen or user-friendly. They can include apps which help citizens and groups express needs, aspirations and good ideas to improve [[Quality of life]] in their communities. Although the listings may be primarily about software, they may also include particularly innovative and similarly citizen (not-bureaucrat) focused projects or resources.

Apps for sustainability is a sub-section of the Resources section in relevant CASwiki [[CASwiki places|place]] and [[Community action for sustainability/topics merge log|topic]] articles.

== Reviews ==

Reviews of any apps listed are welcome on article talk pages.

== Ideas for apps ==

If you have an idea for an app for sustainability which needs collaborative development you're welcome to share your idea via the talk pages within this wiki, either the talk page of a specific location, topic or this page.
