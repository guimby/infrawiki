'''Layers''' are [[chickens]] which produce eggs often and regularly.  This is contrasted with [[meat birds]] and [[heritage breed chickens]]. 

==Breeds==
* Ameracauna
* Ancona
* Aracuna 
* Australorps
* Barnvelder
* Orpington
* Hamburg
* Houdan
* Leghorns (all types)
* Light Sussex
* Minorca

==Cost==
Battery hens are killed once they are 1-year old. If you have the opportunity to acquire these at this age, the price you pay for them should hence be very low. Although after their first year of laying, they are less productive, they should still be productive enough for your requirements.
