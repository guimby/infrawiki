INFORM's mission is to solve complex environmental and health problems through independent research aimed at practical solutions.

INFORM's research and outreach helps government, businesses, community groups, educational institutions, and environmental leaders to reduce pollution and waste, promote sustainable product designs, and convert to sustainable transportation.

We've received many awards since our founding in 1974, and for 33 years have taken a lead position in the [[sustainability]] field.
