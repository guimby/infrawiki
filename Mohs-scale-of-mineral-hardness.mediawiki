'''Mohs scale of mineral hardness''' is a list of ten minerals in ascending order of hardness. Each mineral listed will scratch the minerals numerically lower than it on the scale. It is one of various lists defining hardness in [[materials science]].<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness</ref> It lacks precision but is extremely useful for field geologists.<ref name="wp" />

The list was developed by geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs in 1812.<ref name="wp" /> However, human beings have been assessing hardness for even longer through seeing which minerals scratched which, back to antiquity.<ref name="wp" />

Soft metals are usually considered to be those beneath the hardness of 6 in the list (namely 1 to 5).

"Scratching" is determined to be a "non-elastic dislocation[...] visible to the naked eye".<ref name="wp" />
