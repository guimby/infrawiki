==Abstract==
This is a butterfly bicycle handlebars designed to fit 25.4 mm clamp. I designed this to fulfill the request for 3-D printable bicycle handlebars [[http://www.appropedia.org/Requests_for_3-D_printable_open_source_appropriate_technology]]. This will contribute towards the goal of making 3-D printed bicycle.

I used press-fit designs from [http://makezine.com/2015/07/22/tips-3d-printing-press-fit-parts/]. Basically a circle for outer mating part and 8-sided polygon for the inner mating part. When pressed together, the pointy part of 8-sided polygon will be squished to fit into the outer mating parts.

== Bill of Materials==
300 grams of PLA for $6.

The 3D Model can be found here [https://libre3d.com/category/635/Bicycles/listings/945/Butterfly-Handlebars-for-bike.html libre3d.com]

== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
[[Athena Build Overview| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
Print all the A, B, and C part with the flat side on the bottom. After that, just push the part together. You might have to push a little harder to make them fit. The goal is to make them impossible to pull apart after you put them together.

== Cost savings==
70 % savings over commercial $20 butterfly handlebars
