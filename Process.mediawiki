'''Process''' is the procedure for getting things done. Having an effective process means getting those things dones reliably, efficiently and effectively.
 
Having a well-thought-out process is assumed to mean that you are Doing a Good Thing. If your intervention fails – the village women don't feed their children more beans, or the Ministry of Education refuses to adopt your snazzy new curriculum – the feeling may be that at least your process was good. Or at least it was followed, even if there was no impact. 

Process is a jargon word that is often used use to obscure what's going on. If your process is a series of meetings (and it almost always is), say so. 

== What is a good process? ==
 
A good process is a process that achieves your goals. No more and no less. Nobody benefits from your stakeholder interviews if their input never turns into anything.
