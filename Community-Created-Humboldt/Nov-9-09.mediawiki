==Overview==
This meeting was the first of the [[Community Created Humboldt]] events. A small meeting of leaders in various aspects of community sustainability met at the Plaza Grill, in Arcata, CA.  At this meeting maps of [[Humboldt County]] were overlaid (using velum and markers) with visions of a more sustainable Humboldt.  Participants pushed for a series of larger, more open, meetings involving a more diverse mix of people to happen soon.

Some of the ideas generated were used in the follow up community lecture on [[Community_Created_Humboldt/Veterans_Day_2009|Veterans Day 2009]] and in other following events as well.
