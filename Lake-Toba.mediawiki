'''Lake Toba''' ([[Indonesian]]: '''Danau Toba''') in [[North Sumatra]] is a large, deep [[highland]] lake. The water is very clear, and the surrounding [[population density]] is low, by Indonesian standards, but litter is a problem, and [[water pollution]] supports the growth of [[water hyacinths]], which form miniature floating "islands" in the lake and surround the [[shore]] in some areas. 

Locals commonly [[bathe]] and [[wash clothing]] in the lake, rinsing soaps and detergents directly in the lake water.
