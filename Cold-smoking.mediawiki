'''Cold smoking''' is the process of flavoring, cooking, or preserving [[food]] by exposing it to the smoke from wood. Cold smoked food keeps for a week in the refridgerator.<ref>Practical self-sufficiency by Dick and James Strawbridge</ref> Cold smoking requires [[curing]] as a first step. This is because the smoke only penetrates the surface of the food, and leaves the core/centre of the food unaffected. The only way on how curing can possibly be dismissed is to thus cut the food in very thin/small pieces, so that the contact surface is optimal, allowing the smoke to penetrate the food completely.
