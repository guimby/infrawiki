== Introduction ==
[[Image:Canadagoose.jpg|frame|left|Figure 1. This is a family of Canada geese at the Arcata marsh Wildlife Sanctuary, just an example of some of the birds that come to breed here. The image was taken by Dustin Poppendieck]]
The [[Arcata marsh]] and Wildlife Sanctuary is home to about 200 species of birds that  visit the  marsh each year.<ref>Bulger,Suzie."The Beginners Guide to Birding At the Arcata Marsh" FOAM 1996</ref> Most of these birds that come to the [[Arcata marsh]] Wildlife Sanctuary are seasonal, because they use the marsh only as a breeding site, as seen in ''Figure 1'', or as a place to rest during their biyearly migration. The [[Arcata marsh]] also acts as a refuge and home for other year round birds. 
One of the benefits the birds have at the [[Arcata marsh]] Wildlife Sanctuary is to help maintain a balanced ecosystem. The birds do this by consuming the varieties of marine life, such as fish, shellfish, and vegetation.  Vegetation such as duck moss would other wise over populate and clog the waters of the marsh.

Another thing that the [[Arcata marsh]] offers is as a place where people can come to monitor and watch the variety of birds that can be seen. The reason it is important to monitor the birds at the [[Arcata marsh]] is that some of the birds that visit are rare or endangered. This also allows the opportunity for several bird watchers to come and see the birds that visit each year.

The [[Arcata Marsh]] and Wildlife Center is a perfect location for bird watching and for birds to breed and prosper. The [[Arcata marsh]] is surrounded by many different types of bodies of water and many different types of land.  The land throughout the sanctuary varies widely and has many different types; it includes forests, grasslands, open fields, and shores of all the bodies of water. The marsh is also close to a small town which attracts small birds that live near suburbs. The different types of water are an ocean, a saltwater bay, a lake, a pond, freshwater and saltwater marshes, mudflats, streams, and foothills. This setting in Northern California is an ideal place for birds; it provides such a vast variety of bodies of water that is attracts many different species of bird. The [[Arcata marsh]] has become one of the best places for birds to live and people to watch them.

== Birds of Arcata Marsh ==
It is possible to see over 200 species of birds at the [[Arcata marsh]].<ref>Bulger,Suzie."The Beginners Guide to Birding At the Arcata Marsh" FOAM 1996</ref> Listed below are some of the most common birds that can be seen throughout the year. The types of birds are grouped together based on type of bird. Under each group name is a small description of the group. Below that is a list of the bird's common name, scientific name, size, time of year they are at the Arcata marsh, the best place to look for them, and the possibility a person will see them at that time of year.
