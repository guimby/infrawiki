= Introduction = 
The '''focused ion beam (FIB)''' microscope [http://www.nanolab.ucla.edu/pdf/MRS_Bulletin_2007_FIB_machining.pdf] has gained widespread use in fundamental materials studies and technological applications over the last several years because it offers both high-resolution imaging and flexible micro and nanomachining in a single platform. FIB techniques are used in a variety of applications.  In terms of failure analysis, FIB techniques are commonly used in high magnification microscopy, die surface milling or cross-sectioning, and even material deposition[http://www.siliconfareast.com/FIB.htm].

==Background on FIB==
A FIB system works very similarly to a scanning electron microscope, except that it uses a finely focused beam of gallium (Ga+) ions instead of the latter's use of electrons. This focused primary beam of gallium ions is rastered on the surface of the material to be analyzed.  As it hits the surface, a small amount of material is sputtered, or dislodged, from the surface.  The dislodged material may be in the form of secondary ions, atoms, and secondary electrons.  These ions, atoms, and electrons are then collected and analyzed as signals to form an image on a screen as the primary beams scans the surface.  This image forming capability allows high magnification microscopy [http://www.siliconfareast.com/FIB.htm].

The higher the primary beam current, the more material is sputtered from the surface.  If only high-mag microscopy is intended, only a low-beam operation must be employed. High-beam operation is used to sputter or remove material from the surface, such as during high-precision milling or cross-sectioning of an area on the die.

![[Image:Hitachi_FB-2000A_FIB.jpg|thumb|center|upright=1.50|Fig.1.|Michigan Tech FIB - ACMAL Facicity]]
|}
The Hitachi FB-2000A FIB uses a beam of focused high-energy (30 kV) gallium ions to remove material in a very controlled manner from inorganic specimens. The FB-2000A is a single beam system; that is, users image the specimen with the same beam used for milling. The column resembles that of an electron microscope and functions very much the same. Control of the ion beam is gained through the Unix workstation and fabrication software system that is designed to support both TEM sample preparation and pattern milling[http://mcff.mtu.edu/acmal/electron-microscopy/hitachi-fb-2000a-fib/].

==	Using the NPGS Software==

 NPGS, Nanometer Pattern Generation System, allows a user to create a nanometer pattern on a sample. Generally the beam parameters used are found on the last page of the     FIB manual under the “Beam Mode” column “M1”, using an aperture size of 100µm. Zoom is set at 566x. The center-to-center value is set to 3.69nm.
 The calibration of the FIB is dependent on the densities of the samples.  This procedure is specific for the construction of wave guides. The standard line does is  between 80 and 100, producing depths between 500 and 600 nm. 

'''All images  and figs are in the Image gallery below'''

1.	Close initial NPGS Window and re-open the program by clicking on the NPGS Menu shortcut on the desktop. 
*This is done if you are the first user of the software for the day. [Fig 1.jpg]

2.	Wait 40 seconds for calibration. The FIB only calibrates once per day. [Fig 2.jpg]

3.	Click on DesignCAD files in the upper right pull down bar [Fig 3.jpg]

4.	Click DesignCAD express and hit any key to continue. [Fig 4.jpg]

5.	Click on the line icon in the upper left. [Fig 5.jpg]

6.	Draw a horizontal pattern on the screen.

7.	Click on the line and press Ctrl+I, a window will open to allow the parameters to be set in the “Vector” window.

*Double click when you have defined the line. [Fig 6.jpg]
 
*For point 1, set X:O and Y:O.  
*For point 2, set X:10 and Y:0.  
**You should then set line length to 10. 
*Press Enter, to save the parameters, and close the “Vector” window. [Fig 7.jpg]

8.To make an array,
 
*click on the pull down bar at the top of the screen labeled NPGS>Make Array. Cross hairs will appear; 

*click below the left of the line and then above the right of the line using the crosshairs. [Fig 8.jpg] [Fig 9.jpg]

9.In the NPGS: Make Array Function” windows that appears, enter the following data:

 Number of columns:1 [Fig 10.jpg]
 Column Spacing (If there are more than one)

 Number of rows: 600 [Fig 11.jpg]
 Row spacing: 0.35μm (If there are more than 1) [Fig 12.jpg] 

 The color of your rows and columns can be changed, but hit (N) twice to proceed.  
 Changing the color of lines and columns defines a different layer to be imaged and  this is generally not desired.

'''YOU ALWAYS NEED TO SET THE PATTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN'''.

10.	Click on the pull down bar at the top of the screen labeled NPGS>MaxMag>“O” to change/set the origin of the array. [Fig 13.jpg], [Fig 14.jpg], [Fig 15.jpg]
11.	Click on the pull down bar at the top of the screen labeled NPGS
*>Set Dump Pt. and click near the array where you want to set the point about three times, or until you see a blue dot appear where your pointer is. [Fig 16.jpg], [Fig 17 Dump Point.jpg], [Fig 18 Dump Point 2.jpg]


12.	Click on the pull down bar at the top of the screen labeled NPGS
*>Save, name your file and save it to the current NPGS Project as a type “DesignCADf.”

At this time, you may choose to close this program if you wish. [Fig 19.jpg], [Fig 20.jpg]

13.Right click on the file in the Nanometer Pattern Generator window. 
*Choose the “Run file editor” option. 
*Click on “Pattern name” in the left side of the window. 
*Parameters will appear on the right side.

The user should enter the following parameters for creating a wave guide pattern as shown in the picture: [Fig 21.jpg], [Fig 22.jpg]

Layer 1: Normal Writing
 Origin Offset: 0,0
 Magnification: 566
 Center-to-Center Distance: 3.69 nm
 Line Spacing: 3.69 nm
 Configuration Parameter: 1
 Measured Beam Current (Read off of the FIB): 522.0 pA
 Multiple Pass Mode: Disable
 Line Dose: 100 nC/cm 

14.	Save the file again in “Runfiles” as the same name used before if preferred. 
*Close the “Run File Editor” window. [Fig 23.jpg]
15.	Change “Display file types” to “Run files”. [Fig 24.jpg]


16.	Select you file and click on DAC(+10,+10) near the bottom left of the window. [Fig 25.jpg]

17.	Press “NPGS Mode” in the left column. 

18.	Click on “Process Run File” near the upper left of the screen.
 
19.	Start the FIB and NPGS at the same time. Spacebar will start the NPGS software. [Fig 26.jpg]

20.	Press Esc to manually stop the imaging, or if everything is correct, wait for the timer on the screen to run down. 
*Otherwise, when the program is finished, press Esc twice to get back to the normal screen.

21.	Click FIB Mode in the left column to see your pattern on the Hitachi monitor.
