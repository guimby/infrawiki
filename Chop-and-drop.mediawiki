'''Chop and drop''' is a [[permaculture]] term used to describe a simple, yet highly-efficient system of creating mulch. Plants that make good mulch are pruned frequently and the cuttings are dropped directly on the ground below. This creates a beneficial layer of [[organic material]] that helps conserve water, reduce weeds and create food for nearby plants through decomposition.
