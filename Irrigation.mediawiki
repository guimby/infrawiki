'''Irrigation''' is the supply of [[water]] for [[agriculture]].
Irrigation can cause the soil to (re)consolidate. When this occurs, [[tillage]] is again needed.

==Avoiding the need of irrigation==
{{Main|Soil quality#Water_in_the_soil}}
A well designed agricultural field is made in such a fashion that no irrigation is needed at all, except for in dry periods. To make sure of this, use crops that match the water availability (soil water). In addition, use a correct planting density (space between crops). This as having too many plants at an agricultural field drains off too much water. Finally, the planting pattern may also be optimized. Spreading the plants as good as possible over the field (ie using a [http://www.maniacworld.com/Checkers/checkers.jpg checkers-pattern] rather than simple rows with spaces)<ref>Focus on how the rows are aligned together, rather than focusing on the spaces between the plants on the same row</ref> of the rows is thus advised).
