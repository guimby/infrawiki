 

'''Alkaline fuel cells''' are one of the five types of [[Fuel cells]] that are in research, testing or development. This fuel cell has been used by NASA in its space programs and in the Gemini Space capsule. 

Alkaline Fuel Cells consume Hydrogen and produce electricity (70% efficiency) and heat (30%), 60 degrees C operating temp, and its unit size is 2-5 kW.

Alkaline Fuel cells are used where hydrogen supplies are easily available such as Chemical works and some natural gas production sites. 

They are considered to be a '''Green''' technology because of they are more efficient at converting fuel into electricity than conventional generators however they need associated equipment to ensure the purity of the hydrogen and the air supplies to the fuel cells and they need to replace expensive catalysts at regular intervals.
