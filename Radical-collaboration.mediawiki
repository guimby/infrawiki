To solve the crises we face - especially the pressing issues of [[climate change]], [[poverty]] and [[human trafficking]] - '''radical collaboration''' is essential. This means collaboration between organizations, between individuals, across political lines and between for-profit and non-profit organizations. It means putting aside our self-interests when they stand in the way of a greater good.

== How far should we go? ==

[[Collaboration]] is a complex matter, and should not be sought just for its own sake. Maintain a focus on the mission, and note [[Collaboration#Stages of working together|Himmelman's stages of working together]] - move in gradual steps in deepening relationships, look for practical, achievable actions, and find the level [[appropriate]] to the relationship and the mission.

See [[Collaboration #How far should we go?]] for further examination of this issue.
