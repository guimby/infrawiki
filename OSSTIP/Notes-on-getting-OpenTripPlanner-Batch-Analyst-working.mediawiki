These are short notes on steps followed, July 2013, in getting OpenTripPlanner Analyst working.

Refs:
* https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/SettingUpAnalyst

Steps:
# Install OpenTripPlanner. At the moment, it seems strongly recommended to install the development version of OTP if you want to experiment with OTP analyst.
# generate a graph based on your chosen region via OpenStreetMap data and GTFS schedules - see [[OSSTIP/Setup of OpenTripPlanner to display Melbourne PT network]].
# 

(TODO - update further).
