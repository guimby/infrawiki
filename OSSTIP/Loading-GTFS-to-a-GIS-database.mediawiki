(Notes on attempt so far to load [[GTFS]] data into a [[GIS]] database as part of [[OSSTIP]] project)

== Trying the gtfsdb (on Mac Os X): ==

1) Install psycopg2 (A Python interface to PostgreSQL):
* sudo easy_install psycopg2
* 

2) Install GeoAlchemy
* easy_install -D "SqlAlchemy <= 0.5.8"
* easy_install GeoAlchemy

3) Check out and install gtfsdb:-
* First re-install Mercurial: http://mercurial.berkwood.com/
* Check-out the code: hg clone https://code.google.com/p/gtfsdb/
* Loading basics seem to work ....

So next step, is probably to install PostgreSQL, with PostGIS enabled.
Then see if I can export/load the GTFS data into a PostgreSQL database for
proper analysis work.
