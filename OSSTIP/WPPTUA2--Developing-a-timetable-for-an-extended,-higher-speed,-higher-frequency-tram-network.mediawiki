== WP Essentials ==

This is a Work Package as part of the [[OSSTIP]] project.

'''Inputs''': [[PTUA]]'s specification of which tram routes extend and frequency and speed changes needed. In terms of extensions, a GIS shapefile of proposed route extensions, and the extending stations. Working OSSTIP tools to allow sub-setting an existing GTFS network, and modifying the frequency of certain routes, to then create a new GTFS file (See [[OSSTIP/WP5]] and [[OSSTIP/WP6]].

'''Outputs''': Created GTFS file of the entire tram network with increased speed, frequency, and extended lines.

'''Estimated Time''': Medium 

== Requirements Summary ==

As part of the PTUA Action-Case work in building OSSTIP, improving the tram network speed and frequency was one of the negotiated targets to analyse and communicate as part of their network reform policy proposal.

The speed and frequency changes are:-
* Increasing the average speed across the network by 15% (to simulate improved on-road priority)
* Increasing frequency (when necessary) to 10-min or lower headway, during 6am-midnight, 7-days-a-week.

The priority tram extensions from the PTUA's "every 10 minutes" plan to evaluate are:
* Route 3 East Malvern to the railway station, and on to Chadstone Shopping Centre
* Route 48 North Balwyn to Doncaster Shoppingtown
* Route 5 Malvern to Darling railway station
* Route 86 RMIT Bundoora to South Morang station
* Route 57 along Military Road and Milleara Road to East Keilor (Milleara Mall)
* Route 75 from Vermont South to Knox City
