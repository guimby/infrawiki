== WP Essentials ==

This is a Work Package as part of the [[OSSTIP]] project.

'''Inputs''': [[PTUA]]'s specification of which tram routes extend and frequency and speed changes needed. In terms of extensions, a GIS shapefile of proposed route extensions, and the extending stations. Working OSSTIP tools to allow sub-setting an existing GTFS network, and modifying the frequency of certain routes, to then create a new GTFS file (See [[OSSTIP/WP5]] and [[OSSTIP/WP6]]).

'''Outputs''': Created GTFS file of the entire Melb train network with increased frequency, and extended lines.

'''Estimated Time''': Medium

== Requirements Summary ==

As part of the PTUA Action-Case work in building OSSTIP, improving the train network  frequency was one of the negotiated targets to analyse and communicate as part of their network reform policy proposal.

The frequency changes are:-
* Increasing frequency (when necessary) to 10-min or lower headway, during 6am-midnight, 7-days-a-week.

The priority train route extensions from the PTUA's "every 10 minutes" plan to evaluate are:
* additional station at Southland on Frankston line
* Sunshine to Melton - with an extra station at Caroline Springs
* Huntingdale to Rowville (Stud Park Shopping Centre) - with stations at Monash Uni, Mulgrave, Waverley Park
* Cranbourne to Clyde
* South Morang to Mernda
* Frankston to Baxter (I.E. extend Frankston regular service, and shorten the Stony Point extension part to run from Baxter to Stony Point instead).
* Victoria Park to Doncaster Shoppingtown - with stations at Eastern Fwy/Chandler Hwy, and Eastern Fwy/Bulleen Rd
