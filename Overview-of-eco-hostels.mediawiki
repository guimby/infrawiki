==What is an Eco-hostel?==

[[File:Incomappleux_2008_summer.jpg|thumb|Right|Photo: www.jakobdulisse.com]]

An eco-hostel is an inexpensive and sociable accommodation that enables guests to minimize their ecological footprint during their stay. Guests can usually choose between renting a bed in a private room or bunk in a dormitory. Either choice often shares a bathroom, communal lounge, and kitchen. The term is used loosely, as it is currently used as a marketing strategy to create a "Green Image", in hopes that you'll be encouraged to support their business as a part of your green lifestyle. <ref name="CommNat">Corbett, Julia. 2006. Communicating Nature. p. 152 </ref>


The purpose of this web page is inform both travelers and businesses on existing eco-friendly technologies and activities currently found at eco-hostels around the world. These technologies and activities can be described as any conscious effort to reduce waste, decrease natural resource and energy consumption, provide community integrated education, and support a healthy lifestyle that is beyond the social norm in that region.

==Green Labels & Certifications==

Green labels and certifications are useful tools consumers can use to make better informed decisions, and are marketing strategies that hostels can use to ultimately increase visitorship. Because "green-washing" (as described in the above section) can be used to misinform customers about the degree of sustainability, labels and certifications are helpful to provide customers with credible information.

Most labels and certifications require baseline criteria to be met, but can be applied for at no extra cost. An example of [http://www.green-key.org/ green key's] criteria can be found [http://www.kmvk.nl/cmslib/www.kmvk.nl/greenkeyorg/files/International_baseline_criteria_HOTELS_V1.2.doc here].

Other green labels and certifications include:

==Why Make a Hostel Eco-Friendly?==

For starters, you are doing your community (and ultimately the earth) a great service. Other benefits include reduced operating cost and taxes, operating subsidies, and a growing consumer market. In a recent survey, hotel owners ranked ''reducing operating costs'' and ''demands from customers'' as the top two incentives to undertake environmentally oriented initiatives. <ref name="EnvHostel">Bohdanowicz, Paulina. 2006.
