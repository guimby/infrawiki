'''Biodegradable waste''' is a [[type of waste]], typically originating from [[plant]] or [[animal]] sources, which may be degraded by other living organisms. Waste that cannot be broken down by other living organisms are called non-biodegradable.<ref>[http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/informationsheets/wastedisposal.htm UK waste online website]</ref>

Biodegradable waste can be commonly found in [[municipal solid waste]] (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as [[green waste]], [[food waste]], [[paper]] waste, and [[biodegradable plastics]]. Other [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] wastes include [[human waste]], [[manure]], [[sewage]], [[slaughterhouse waste]]. In the absence of [[oxygen]] much of this waste will decay to [[methane]] by [[anaerobic digestion]].<ref>[http://www.cslondon.org/downloads/2010_Waste_Review.pdf CSL London Olympics Waste Review]</ref>

== Climate change impacts ==
The main environmental threat from biodegradable waste is the production of methane in landfills. Methane is 21 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide and accounted for some 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-15 in 1995. The Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC obliges Member States to reduce the amount of biodegradable waste that they landfill to 35% of 1995 levels by 2016, which will significantly reduce the problem.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/compost/index.htm EC page on biodegradable waste]</ref>l

== Uses of biodegradable waste ==
Biodegradable waste can often be used for [[composting]] which turns the waste into [[humus]].
It can also be used as a resource for heat, electricity and fuel in future, by using [[anaerobic digestion]]<ref>[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]].

This produces additional [[Biogas]] and still delivers usable nutrients that can be implemented to the soil.<ref>[http://www.kompogas-utzenstorf.ch/pdf/kreislauf.pdf Recycling chain]</ref> Especially animal-based kitchen scraps (such as leftover fish, meat), ... are best disposed this way (as these are best not composted). Finally note that leftover human food (vegetables, ... -no animal flesh-) can also be used as fodder to [[Keeping flightless birds|flightless birds]], goats, pigs, sheep, ... or alternatively can be fed to birds, and other wildlife.

In the USA, approximately 50% of waste sent to landfills or incinerators is biodegradable;
therefore, composting could create many new jobs, and recover significant resources that are being lost.<ref>https://ilsr.org/compost-impacts/</ref>
