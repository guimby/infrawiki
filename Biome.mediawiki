A '''biome''' is a major biotic unit that displays an identifiable array of plant and animal life with common characteristics resulting from living under a similar climate.<ref name="wp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome</ref> A biome is usually identified by its dominant plant formation, and the fauna dependent on those plants form part of the biome.

== Characteristics of a biome ==
Each biome is distinctive. This is principally determined by climate, in particular the rainfall pattern, the temperature of the area or region and the amount of solar radiation received.

Biome borders are not distinct, as the range of plants (and fauna) has a gradation of coverage over a broad area, creating overlap areas before one type of plant completely gives way to another. The area where dominant plants from adjacent biomes meet is known as an [[ecocline]].

A biome differs from a [[habitat]] in that a biome can contain various habitats.<ref name="wp" />

== Principal biomes ==
The main terrestrial biomes are:
*Temperate deciduous forest
*Temperate coniferous forest
*Tropical forest
*Grassland
