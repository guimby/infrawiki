'''Livable neighborhoods''' allow [[local communities]] to flourish, discourage [[crime]], and allow for a healthier lifestyle. 

They come about either through a traditional pre-car infrastructure and layout of streets and houses, or through approaches to urban design and planning that draw their inspiration from these older neighborhoods - e.g. [[Traditional Neighborhood Development]]{{w|Traditional Neighborhood Development (TND)}}) .

More specifically, such neighborhoods can be created through:
* [[Mixed use]] - appropriate commercial use
* [[Walkability]] - [[pedestrian]]-friendly design
* [[Cycle paths]]
* [[Transit]] [[Transit hubs|hubs]] within easy walking distance of everyone in the community
* Fast and reliable public transport
* [[Public space]]
* [[Traffic calming]] such as chicanes and shared streets

Activities to encourage the new mindset can bring the community together:
* [[Carfree days]]
* [[Street parties]]
* For the more radically inclined: [[Reclaim The Streets]]{{w|Reclaim The Streets}} events.
* [[Food garden]] activities

== High density neighborhoods ==

While high density city living offers many advantages in lifestyle and sustainability (see [[Green Manhattan]]) there is typically much less sense of being neighbors, compared to well designed [[medium density]].
