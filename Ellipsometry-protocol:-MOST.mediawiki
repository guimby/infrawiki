= Introduction = 
Ellipsometry{{W|Ellipsometry}} is a powerful technique whereby the change in the polarization of light reflecting off a surface is analyzed to determine the optical and dielectric properties of a thin film. This analysis can yield information about layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the probing light itself, even down to a single atomic layer. Ellipsometry can probe the complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor, which gives access to fundamental physical parameters and is related to a variety of sample properties including thickness, morphology, crystal quality, chemical composition, or electrical conductivity. 

Unlike single-wavelength (laser) ellipsometry, which uses a monochromatic light beam, spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. SE in these regions studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties such as band-to-band transitions or excitons.

SE uses polarized light to determine optoelectronic properties of a material. SE requires some knowledge of the test specimen, such as the number and thickness of films deposited on a substrate transparent in the operating range of the SE.

The ellipsometer used is a J.A. Woollam variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). The VASE is connected to a computer where WVase32 software is used for data collection. Data is saved by the program as a .txt file that can be imported into other software, such as [[Libre Office]], for analysis.  [http://www.jawoollam.com/ J.A. Woollam] V-VASE ellipsometer{{w|ellipsometer}} is available for ellipsometry in M&M Room 431 at MTU. [http://www.jawoollam.com/vase_home.html General VASE Specifications]

==Before you can start==

Before you can use the ellipsometer, you must pass a safety training quiz for the [http://mcff.mtu.edu/mff/ MTU Microfabrication Facility].  If you are interested in becoming trained to use this equipment, talk to Dr. Pearce then please email:
Paul Bergstrom (paulb@mtu.edu) or Bill Knudsen (wknudsen@mtu.edu) in order to get more information.

Before independent use of this equipment can be done, you must become certified. A training program of (3 observations/3 operations) must be done before a practical exam is ran.  After the practical exam has been passed, you may begin operating the equipment independently.

The following method is used in order to do ellipsometry (as taught during the training).

== Data Analysis and Modelling ==

After scan completes, the next step is to build a model.
 It is important to keep your model as simple as possible but not simpler. For more accurate results when dealing with complex structures, it is recommended to model each individual layer independently!!  
 Detailed documentation on step by step data analysis and model building is available upon request.  
 
'''Building a Model'''(This is just a general description)

Before building a model, it is necessary to know;
# The number of layers in the sample (which may include roughness layers),
# Identity of different layers, and
# Approximate thickness of each layer.

|}

Click on Model Window (on desktop)(See Fig.4)

Then go; Toolbar -> Add Layer
*Start by adding your first layer, e.g. If your sample is substrate + Oxide film;
**Using general material name, found in the database, add layer; 
**ie. Si.mat for silicon, a-si.mat for amorphous silicon, or glass for a glass substrate
** then add next layer following the same procedure as for the substrate.
*You can also build multiple layered models depending on your sample. See the Model window for one of our sample scans (p-layer on glass)
'''Note:''' you can delete and add a different layer during model building using "Add/Delete layer from the toolbar. 
*OR add multiple layers using previous scan information from proper directory
*Type in approximate thickness of layer.

== Data Analysis ==
