''Lumbricus rubellus'' is the scientific name for European driftworm (a.k.a. Red Wiggler). It is actually a burrowing worm but stays close enough to the surface and active enough to be useful in [[Vermiculture]]. <ref>http://working-worms.com/content/view/38/60//#latin</ref>

===Environmental Warning===
''Lumbricus rubellus'' is possibly an invasive species in US forested areas.<ref>http://working-worms.com/content/view/38/60//#e</ref>
