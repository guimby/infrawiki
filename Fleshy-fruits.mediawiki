'''Fleshy fruits''' refers to fruits that produce plentiful flesh and are highly desirable as edible produce for both humans and other species. Nature intended many fleshy fruits to be eaten by animals, to aid dispersion of the seeds.

Fleshy fruits are considered to be ready for consumption (market maturity) at different rates, depending on the plant and the stage at which maturation is appealing to the consumer.

Fleshy fruits include berries, certain vegetables such as eggplants, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. and soft fruits.

If collecting seeds from fleshy fruits, they often need to be freed from surrounding fleshy pulp first, then dried, before storing and/or using.
