The fiber optic cable holder consists of three components: the metal rod, the plastic base, and the fiber optic cable holder.  The metal rod fits through the holder and the holder is held in place with a set screw.  The fiber optic cable is placed within the holder is held in place with another set screw.  The fiber optic cable is the Ocean Optics QP600-2-VIS-NIR.  The wide plastic base gives the whole setup stability and flexible placement.

This optical component is not designed to be fitted into an optical breadboard or lab bench.  The advantage of this is that there is no limit to placement for the lens holder within the optical system.  However, the disadvantage is loss of stability associated with an optical lab bench.
