'''Sarapis''' envisions a world in which each person is free to explore their own self-actualization because of an abundance of wholesome [[food]] and dignified [[shelter]]. We believe that world will become possible when everyone has access to the solutions they need to provide for themselves and their communities. Many of these solutions already exist in the form of the FLO ([[free/libre/opensource]]) ecosystem of [[software]], [[hardware]], [[data]] and [[knowledge]] tools and techniques.
