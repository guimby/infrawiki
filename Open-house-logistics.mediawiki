=Resource Logistics=

This section is for discussion of the resource logistics of the Open House project; the sources and acquisition strategies for the materials and hardware employed in the building project. We will seek materials sponsorship for bulk materials, EcoBoard, wheatboard, or similar sheet materials in particular. But we will also need to explore the potential of recycling and repurposing, diverse goods donation, and other novel sources of supplies and materials. A dedicated worker will be needed as the team 'scrounger', exploring the possible alternative acquisition of what the project needs.
