Free '''car parking''' makes [[urban]] [[traffic]] congestion worse, increases [[pollution]] ([[air pollution]] and pollution in [[stormwater]] runoff from roads) and [[fuel consumption]] while reducing the [[quality of life]] for [[pedestrians]] and residents.

UCLA Professor Donald Shoup, in his 2005 book ''[[The High Cost of Free Parking]]'', describes the true cost and the [[externalities]] of providing free parking.

"We have expensive housing for people and free parking for cars," he points out.
