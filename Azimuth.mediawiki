'''Azimuth''' - a mathematical concept defined as the angle, usually measured in degrees (°), between a reference plane and a point. This concept is used in many practical applications including navigation, astronomy, mapping, mining and artillery. The word azimuth is derived from the Arabic السمت ('as-sumūt') which means the ways, referring to the ways or directions a person faces. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth]

Azimuth is also a very important concept for design of [[solar energy]] systems.
