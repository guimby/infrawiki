<center>'' Building a Chicken Coop to help educate students at Redwood Montessori ''</center>

==Abstract==
[[Redwood Coast Montessori]] and the Community Center of Manila have made agreements with the ENGR215 Fall 2014 class of [[Humboldt State University]] in regards to  incorporate the students' class projects into the area of the Manila Community Center so that they may benefit the school and surrounding community. The Chicken Coop project's objective was to house and protect poulty that may be owned by the school.  With children in mind, the coop should be easy to use and with a harsh coastal environment the school is located on, the structure must be durable.

== Background ==
Founded in 2005, [[Redwood Coast Montessori]] is a school located next to the Manila Sand Dunes in Arcata, CA. The first class was held in one classroom on a traditional public school campus in Eureka, CA. In June 2012, the Arcata School District approved Redwood Coast Montessori’s charter application to become a K-8 independent public charter school which began on July 1, 2013. Based on the Montessori method, students who attend are empowered with a rich curriculum that focuses on  the natural development of the whole child.  Redwood Coast Montessori classrooms are based on the Montessori approach of a articulate hands on learning.

== Problem Statement and Criteria ==
Specifications and a set criteria were the foundations of how this project was worked on and constructed. These aspects have been conjured up by the team Los Pollos Hermanos with keeping in mind the best interests of the client Redwood Coast Montessori. Based on the school's needs the Chicken Coop and Run design must meet the criteria, and stay within the constraints listed below.

== Description of final project ==

=== Coop ===
	The layout of the chicken coop is a simple 4’x6’x4’ box, framed out by 2”x2”. The walls and floor are constructed with ¾” sheets of outdoor grade lumber. The coop is being lifted off the ground with four concrete stands located at each corner of the coop. Giving the coop good ventilation, there are two 6”x12” closable openings positioned at the top corners of the side walls. Chickens will be able to enter the coop with a 1’x2’ door located on the front side. Once the chickens walk into the coop there are three 6”x9” x1’ box like nests placed on both sides. For easy retrieval of the possible eggs being laid in these nests, located on the exterior sides there are swinging doors connected to each individual nest. The doors will be able to pivot of a hinge placed at the top. A single bar that is locked in position and lying across these three doors act as a simple securing system eliminating multiple locks for the coop. Going back inside the coop towards the back there are two roosting bars at different heights giving multiple layers where chickens can roost. The roosting bars are also given a foot space in each direction giving the chickens optimum personal space. Both bars are places on U-shaped frames for the ability of removing them as you lift them up. To make the coop easier to clean, the back wall is turned into a door that is supported by two hinges on the side. Securing the back door so that it cannot be open by anyone is another lock.

=== Roof ===

	The roof is a simple gable style design, measuring at a foot tall, it’s made out of the same material as the coop. To make the coop stand up against weather, roofing tile is laid along the top of the rood. This also helps with the insulation.

[[Image:Montessori roofcoop.jpeg|thumb|Fig 3: Chicken Coop roof]]<br />

=== Run ===

	The chicken run is laid out at 5’x10’x4’. As the main support, there is a framework made out of 2”x2”. The run itself is made out of chicken wire with one inch opening to give the chickens’ proper protection from predators. To add more protection, the wire runs a foot underneath the ground and buried to ward of predators digging. To get into the run, a 18”x5’ door is positioned on the side of the run. To connect the run to the coop, a 6” overlap of chicken wire is given and laid over the coop. A simple piece of lumber is then laid over the overlapping wire and the coop and screwed into place sealing off the inside of the run.

== Costs ==
===Design Costs===
The design cost is the amount of time in hours that the Pollos Hermanos spent on this design project. The design hours were spilt into four categories: design report, group meetings, client meeting, and building. The total hours spent on the design project were 300 hours. The figure below represents the distribution of time and percentages.



===Materials Cost===
The cost of the materials used for the construction of The Good Ship Alice COOPer are outlined in table below.Having the higher priced items be donated, the projected retail cost of this design project is $621and is shown in table Below.

===Maintenance Costs===
The projected maintenance is based off of research done for this project in the literature review. The chicken coop must be cleaned inside and out once a month which consists on cleaning out each nest by replacing the hay and removing all traces of droppings on the inside and outside of the coop. The inside of the chicken coop will need to be retreated with the bees wax and olive oil mixture recommended once every five years to protect it against the costal dune environment. The cost of these are shown in table below.
