'''Agraria''' is a community which is planned to be:
* [[innovative]] 
* [[Low-energy use]] based on a belief in the threat of [[peak oil]]. The goal is a 75% reduction from current average energy used per capita.
* [[Sustainable]] requiring minimal [[inputs]] (especially [[fossil fuels]]) and creating zero or almost zero [[outputs]] (notably [[municipal waste]] and [[sewage]]).
* [[Small]], based on the belief that smallness itself is a value for positive social organization.

This is a project of the [[Arthur Morgan Institute for Community Solutions]]. The principles of our organization view a cooperative way of life to be preferable to current competitive ways of living.

It is their view that new [[agrarian communities]] will be most successful if close to existing small communities, offering benefits to both the existing and the new communities.
