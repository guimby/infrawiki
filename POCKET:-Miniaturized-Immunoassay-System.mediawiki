==Problem being addressed==
Early detection of HIV can help to effectively control the spread of the virus. Existing diagnostic systems, especially enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (aka ELISA), are bulky, expensive, and require electricity, lengthy incubation periods, and multiple pipetting stages.  The POCKET combines the immunoassay unit and the detector unit into a portable and cost-effective model.

==Detailed description of the solution==
A blood sample is delivered to each channel of the device and is analyzed by an antibody-detecting strip. Protein fragments on the strip bind HIV antibodies. A series of rapid, yet precise chemical assays are performed on detected antibodies for identification and quantification.

==Designed by==
*Designed by: The Whitesides Research Group at Harvard University.  Their home page is found [http://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/index.php here].
*Manufacturing: Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

==When and where it was tested/implemented ==
The prototype was developed in 2004 at Harvard, and as of 2004, Harvard Universityâ€™s Office for Technology and Trademark Licensing has been negotiating with a start-up firm to commercialize the POCKET.
