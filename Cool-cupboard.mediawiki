The '''cool cupboard''' is an installation that refrigerates food with no electricity. It is similar to a conventional refrigerator in design: a vertical set of shelves enclosed in an insulated chamber. Placed on the ground floor, the bottom of the cool cupboard is open to the cavity beneath a house. A flue is opened through the top of the cupboard. This allows cool air to rise from beneath the house, keeping stored food cool, and eventually rise through the flue as it warms up.
