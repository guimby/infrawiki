Cheap home made [[water filter]].

Dirty water is a big problem for most households in this world.
But with a 20 litre bucket or plastic jerry can some clean cloth
and 5 kgs of cleaned sand you can make a household water filter.

* First punch lots of holes in the bottom of your container in one corner, using a medium to large sized nail or power drill.
** Next, place the doubled over cloth inside over the top of the holes so as to stop the sand excaping out through the holes.
*** Now wash about 10kgs of river or beach sand many times until you have washed away all the impurities. Usually you will loose 50% of the sand in the washing process.
**** Add the sand until the bucket/jerry can is half full.<br><br>Place the bucket/jerry can on top of your tank or water storage container.<br>Now pour the dirty water in on top of the sand. It will filter through and come out clean at the bottom and run into your large storge container.<br>You might be in a situation where you can trickle the dirty water in 24 hours a day from a hose pipe.<br>When the sand is dirty and full of impurities you can wash it clean and use it over again.
