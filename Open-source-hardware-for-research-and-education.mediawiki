In this short comment for physicists it is argued that by taking that extra step of sharing their existing hardware designs, users can help accelerate the availability of [[open-source scientific hardware]] for everyone, and they will directly benefit as the international [[open-source]] community takes the design, further improves it, and re-shares the results.
