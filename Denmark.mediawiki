Denmark is frequently ranked as the happiest country in the world in cross-national studies of happiness. It also ranks as having the world's highest social mobility and a high level of income equality. <ref>[[wikipedia:Denmark]]</ref>

Denmark has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation; in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973. To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the following international agreements: Antarctic Treaty; Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol etc. <ref>[[wikipedia:Denmark#Environment]]</ref>

== Initiatives by topic ==

=== Climate action ===

Denmark's green house gas emissions per dollar of value produced has been for the most part unstable since 1990, seeing sudden growths and falls. Overall though, there has been a reduction in gas emissions per dollar value added to its market. It lags behind other Scandinavian countries such as [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. <ref>[[wikipedia:Denmark#Environment]]</ref>

'''Solar energy''': Denmark reached its year 2020 government goal of 200 MW solar cell capacity in 2012, and has 500 MW solar capacity in 90,000 private installations as of 2013. Danish energy sector players estimate that this development will result in 1000 MW by 2020 and 3400 MW by 2030. <ref>[[wikipedia:Energy in Denmark#Solar]]</ref>

=== Cycling activism ===

Bicycling in Denmark is a common and popular recreational and utilitarian activity. Bicycling infrastructure is a dominant feature of both city and countryside infrastructure with bicycle paths and bicycle ways in many places and an extensive network of bicycle routes extending more than 12,000 kilometres (7,500 mi) nationwide (in comparison Denmark's coastline is 7,314 kilometres (4,545 mi)). As a unique thing, Denmark has a VIN-system for bicycles which is mandatory by law. Often bicycling and bicycle-culture in Denmark is compared to the Netherlands as a bicycle-nation. <ref>[[wikipedia:Transport in Denmark#Cycling]]</ref>

=== Food activism ===

Ecological agriculture and production is significant on Samsø, with a broad network of cooperating associations. It comprise farming of a large variety of vegetables, grains and fruits, livestock meat and products (lambs, sheep, yarn, cows, pigs, horses, donkeys, goats, chickens, eggs), a dairy, a brewery, restaurants and cafés, candy production, [[permaculture]] and forest garden experiments. There are several plans for extending the overall ecological production and broaden the industry (a slaughterhouse, orangery, forest gardens and education), with a wish for creating more jobs and stimulate settlements on the island. <ref>[[wikipedia:Samsø#Sustainable production and agriculture]]</ref>

'''Waterways''': The only manmade waterways in Denmark are some tourist canals, like the canals in [[Copenhagen]] and the Odense Canal. There is also a 160 km route through the Limfjorden in northern Jutland linking the North Sea to the Kattegat. <ref>[[wikipedia:Transport in Denmark#Waterways]]</ref>
