{{Lang|[[Bengkel bersih|Bahasa Indonesia]]}}

Small [[mechanic shops]] in [[Indonesia]] tend to [[pollute]] the local environment, especially the [[soil]]. When the soil is very polluted, the shop will often be moved somewhere else. 

A project in [[Banda Aceh]] developed a design using:
* [[concrete]] floor
* [[drainage]] system (hole in the floor, liquid passed through a basket-shaped sieve)
* [[septic tank]]
* [[leach field]] (planned, perhaps not implemented?)

This project was carried out in 2007 in Banda Aceh, [[Aceh]], Indonesia by [[SLGSR]], a division of [[GTZ]], the German aid agency.
