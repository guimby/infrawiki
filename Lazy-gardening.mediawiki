'''Lazy gardening''', '''effortless gardening''', '''efficient gardening''' or '''no-fuss gardening''' refers to a method of [[gardening]] which uses work-saving techniques in order to reduce the effort and time required to maintain a garden.

==Why==
Although gardening provides an occupation and something to do with their free time (ie for retired people, young people, ...), it often requires too much time for the working-class people. As such, a reduction in time and effort is highly beneficial to this target group. 

Due to this, the method helps in keeping gardens more practical for anyone, and can improve the gardens (hereby also increasing local biodiversity).

==Methods==
Lazy gardening can be done using many methods and equipment:
* [[Mulching]] reduces weeding and sometimes the amount of watering required.
* [[False seed bed]]s: reduce weeding in new seed beds
* [[Easy-to-grow plant]]s make it easier for the unskilled gardener
* [[No-turn surface composting]], or integrated composting (within the bed, like in keyhole gardening)
* [[Automated irrigation|Automated irrigation systems]] eliminate the need of watering plant pots
* Some types of [[green wall|vertical garden]]s (ie made with pallets): can be easy to maintain
* [[Robotic lawn mower]]s can eliminate the need of mowing
* [[Container gardening|Containers or pots]] may be useful to grow plants above an impenetrable layer (ie floor, concrete driveway, ...)
