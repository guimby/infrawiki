'''Multi-level buildings''' havea number of advantages in [[sustainable design]] and urban planning:
* They allow higher population densities, reducing distances traveled and making [[public transport]] more  feasible and effective.
* They reduce the [[urban heat island]] effect, especially when interspersed with green [[open space]], and in combination with light colored roofs and [[green roofs]].

== High-rise and community ==

The challenges include allowing communities and relationships to flourish (essential to [[quality of life]]. While higher densities and shorter distances make engaging in social activities much easier, relationships between neighbors tend to be very limited in high-rise living. 

The ideal for this aspect of community may be the [[dense-low]] style of housing popular in, for example, Denmark.<ref>Newman P and Kenworthy J, ''[[Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence]]''.</ref> This is development which is several stories high, with adjoining buildings, resulting in medium-high [[population density]] and allowing good transport options, but residences generally have their own entrance onto the street.
