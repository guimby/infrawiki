[[Summer schools]] and [[programs]] in [[appropriate technology]] include:
* The [[International Development Design Summit]]
* The [[Parras]] summer program in Northern Mexico, a program of Humboldt State University.

== Proposed programs ==

An email discussion between Michel Bauwens and various people interested in appropriate technology and [[open manufacturing]] has proposed an international program for mid-2009, perhaps in Thailand.

Another option is Mexico - this has the advantage of being close for more people who are known to be interested, and having the HSU Parras program there, to examine what has worked and what hasn't, and as a reference point when seeking funding.
