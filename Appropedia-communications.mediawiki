The [[A:Appropedia community|Appropedia community]] is held together with '''communication'''. At the moment this consists of:
* Talk pages
* Email notifications to page changes.
* [[A:Social media|Social media]]
* Email and IM between members of the community who know each other. 

Communication could be greatly improved with:
* A [[A:newsletter|newsletter]]
* A weekly digest of changes.]
* Encouragement and feedback to users, especially new users. The nature of the first interaction is a strong influence on whether a new member stays around. We do this already, to an extent, but it takes time and we don't have a dedicated team.
