'''A Recipe To Live''' is an indoor climate [[natural building]] project designed by students Masaki Ogasawara, Keisuke Tsukada and Erika Mikami of Waseda University, [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The design utilizes [[bokashi]] [[composting]] of [[straw]] inside the building during the Winter. Arcylic cases of the compost are placed inside the building, yielding a temperature of 30Â°C for several weeks. In the Summer, panels on the outside walls allow for harvested straw to be sun dried. This also cools the building during hot weather. The building is located in a [[cattle]] farming area, which produces an abundance of straw.
