'''Fish ladders''' (also called ''fishways'' and ''fish passes'') are used to help fish get upstream to spawn. When [[dams]] or other obstructions are created in a stream or river, it is sometimes necessary to help the fish so that they can continue to do their part in the river ecosystem. 

===Types of fish ladders===
There are five basic types of fish ladders<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10364_19092-46291--,00.html What is a Fish Ladder? Retrieved February 10, 2010, from Michigan Natural Resources & Environment]</ref>. All of these examples can be found around the United States, but some are used on large waterways more often than others:

*'''Pool-Weir''': This type of fishway design is used most often at man-made passageways and is the oldest type of fish ladder.
*'''Vertical Slot''': The vertical slot design makes use of large narrow slots to control water flow. It is more complicated than the pool-weir type; however, it allows the water to flow at a constant rate.
*'''Denil''': The denil fishway uses devices that regulate the flow of water. This then acts like a set of rapids with various water speeds. Therefore, this design can be used by a variety of fish species.
*'''Steeppass''': The steeppass fishway design is similar to that of the denil; however, steeppass fishways are typically narrower than denil fishways. 
*'''Natural Bypasses''': Natural bypasses make use of  materials found in nature and are intended to allow fish to bypass barriers.

==Why do we need fish ladders ?==
It has been found that entire [[fish]] species are either close to extinction or totally extinct because they are unable to reproduce. Some species of fish must migrate upstream to find a suitable place to spawn, and many man-made obstacles make that virtually impossible. Fish ladders allow fish to circumvent this problem and encourage natural reproduction.
