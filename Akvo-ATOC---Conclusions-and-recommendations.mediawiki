{{Akvo ATOC}}

== Project output ==

'''''Note''': The actual report as delivered verbally to Mark Charmer and Thomas Bjelkeman-Pettersson of [[Akvo]] in early 2009. The contents have influenced my blogging and wiki writing since then, and I am actively updating the pages (which are also [[open edit]]) but there isn't a specific category. The best suggestion is to view the pages linked from the navigation bar on the right. --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]]''

[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] is planning to blog and/or write on the wiki on these topics:
* Interviews for blogs
* Structure and syntax in OSAT
:* What ''is'' appropriate technology exactly? What kinds of data, information, knowledge and wisdom are we sharing?
* Usability
* Dispersed efforts for OSAT - upsides, downsides; 
:* how to having our cake and eat it
* [[Open design]] licenses
* Give interviews: Agroinnovations; Ian Woolf and/or John August; approach NPR/ABC (Aust).

== Possible areas of further thought and study ==
* Explore different software options. 
:* Can elements of a design be broken down in a way that they can be tracked in a "history"?
