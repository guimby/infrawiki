'''Mircofab Lab: Spin Coater'''

An open source flat spin coater for use in the microfabrication lab, used to spin extremely thin layers onto wafers or other materials.

A commercial low-end spin coater would cost approximately $1300, this holder will cost approximately $6 to print, plus 
It takes about one day to print all the parts, using only one printer.
