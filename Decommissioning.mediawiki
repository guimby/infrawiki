== Definition of Decommissioning ==
Decommission mean to withdraw from service. In an energy context it normally refers to nuclear decommissioning -- removing a [[nuclear energy]] plant from service. Because of the possible presence of radioactive or fissile material in a nuclear facility, special precautions are required.

== Methods of Decommissioning ==
==='''Dismantling'''===
Parts of the reactor are removed or decontaminated soon after the nuclear plant closes,allowing the land to be used for other purposes.

==='''Safe Storage'''===
The nuclear plant is monitored and radiation is allowed to decay. Then afterwards it is dismantled.

==='''Entombment'''===
Sealing off radioactive components with concrete and steel. This allows radiation to decay until the land can be used for other purposes.
