==thoughts .... ideas... ==

Open company... organic cotton farming... w/indoor organic hydroponics....

...

How Many HUMANS in the USA have a bunch of JUNK sitting in their GARAGES!?!?! a lot? a few? A million? there are three hundred million Americans... 310 maybe about... actually......

lets say... 1 percent have junk in their GARAGES that they could GET rid of OF to have more SPACE.

....

lets say.... an organic hydroponics garden.... with a seed starter.... and.... 10 SQ feed of space was used for growing ORGANIC cotton? 

might there be a COTTON processor who would be willing to BUY relatively SMALLISH quantities of the COTTON from 3 MILLION AmericanS?

===Questions===
How much cotton could 10SQ Feet of Organic Hydroponic Yeild?

How much energy would it take to grow this?

How long would the system last?

what would be the lifetime cotton yeild?

What would be the net economic benefit/loss for Americans or other countries? 

would the resulting products (jeans, shirts, socks, sweatshirts, jackets, etc) be marketable?\

How much time/energy would system maintenance and upkeep take?

..........

what if... food was grown? would it be economical?
