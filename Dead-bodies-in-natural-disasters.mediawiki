Bodies of people who died healthy do not spread disease.

People handling bodies face a small risk, and should practice [[basic hygiene]] (especially [[handwashing]]) to minimize risk.

In crisis-struck areas, the dead are sometimes hastily buried in mass graves, due to fears their bodies spread disease. However, this is not true, unless there is a contagious disease in the population. 

Burying the bodies in haste makes identification difficult, is a waste of resources, and interferes with the grieving process for survivors and relatives.
