The effects of flooding are traditionally reduced by:
* Building on higher ground
* Building on stilts
* Living on floating houses, or house boats

More modern solutions involve stopping the water from entering the house by blocking all places where water can enter - see [[Wikipedia:Flood mitigation #Protection of individual properties]]

Stilts and house boats are the chosen solutions where there is a lack of suitable high ground.

An idea has been proposed for a more high tech solution: "Using a steel dock-like structure and blocks of [[Styrofoam]], a Louisiana professor has designed housing that avoids flood-damage by moving with rising water."<ref>[http://www.planetizen.com/node/24200 'Adaptive' Housing For Flood-Prone Areas], ''planetizen.com'' 1 May 2007</ref> This is still at the design stage and it seems like that it would be more expensive, and (being a more complex design) has more to go wrong.
