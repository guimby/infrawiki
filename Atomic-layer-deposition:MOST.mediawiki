'''Atomic layer deposition''' (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique that is based on the sequential use of a gas phase chemical process. ALD reactions generally use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with a surface one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Thus it is possible to deposit a very precise thin film by exposing the precursors to the growth surface repeatedly. [[MOST]] uses ALD techniques to fabricate solar [[photovoltaic]] devices.
