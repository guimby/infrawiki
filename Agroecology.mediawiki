'''Agroecology''' is the study of ecological processes applied to agricultural production systems.

Agroecologists may study questions related to the four system properties of agroecosystems: productivity, stability, [[sustainability]] and equitability. Agroecologists study these four properties through an interdisciplinary lens, using natural sciences to understand elements of agroecosystems such as soil properties and plant-insect interactions, as well as using social sciences to understand the effects of farming practices on rural communities, economic constraints to developing new production methods, or cultural factors determining farming practices.

Under agroecology are the three land-use sciences, [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[agroforestry]]. Although these use their plant components in different ways, they share the same theoretical core.
