===='''Child labour''' is defined as work that:====
*is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful to children
*interferes with their schooling
*deprives them of the opportunity to attend school
*obliges them to leave school prematurely
*requires them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work

In its most extreme forms, child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves

Children’s participation in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling, is generally regarded as being positive. This includes activities such as: 
*helping their parents around the home 
*assisting in a family business 
*earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays 

These kinds of activities contribute to children’s development and to the welfare of their families; they provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life.<br />

===Triple Bottom Line===
Values and criteria for measuring success in three main areas: social, environmental and economical.Also known as the 3P concept.<br />
http://philosophia.uncg.edu/node/355
====People====
Social sustainability requires that a business foster an environment in which all can succeed. In the big-picture it is better for a whole society to thrive than for one single corporation to thrive alone. This allows the company to continue to exist, and it will foster good-will between the company and the society.

====Planet====
Environmental sustainability stems from the recognition that resources are not infinite, and that too much degradation will worsen the lives of ourselves, our children and so on. Members of the moral community ought not cause undue harm to the people around them and the people who will come later, and value protection of the environment. Efforts should be made to renew some of the environments that have been harmed in the past
====Profit====
Economic sustainability must focus on the long term because this is the nature of a persistent company. A decision which creates an economic boon in the short-term, but causes long-term harm, would likely reduce this bottom line

===Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)===
https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/what-is-GRI/Pages/default.aspx<br />
A non-profit organization that provides companies and organizations with a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework, widely used around the world, to measure and report their economic, environmental, social and governance performance – the four key areas of sustainability. <br />
By reporting transparently and with accountability, organizations can increase the trust that stakeholders have in them, and in the global economy.
