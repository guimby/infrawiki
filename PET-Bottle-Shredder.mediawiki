==Abstract==

Included below is three different designs for PET bottle shredders currently designed for 20oz soda bottles but easily expandable for use with 2 liter soda bottles. The first design is a simple hand held shredder which is the simplest design and uses the least plastic. This makes this design ideal for areas which have access to a 3D printer but which filament might not be as readily available. The second design adds a bottle holder to the simple hand held shredder. This holder was added to possibly aid in efficiency. The third design is a hand cranked design which also uses a bottle holder and spools the cut filament. These shredders allow the use of the cut PET to be used in things like crafts and possibly for printing purposes.

== Bill of Materials==
#3-D printer
#OpenScad
#PLA filiment
#Single sided razor blade
#2 M3x6mm screws
#2 M3 nuts

*[[File:HandBottleCutter.scad]]
*[[File:HandBottleCutterv2.scad]]


== Tools needed for fabrication of the OSAT==
# [[Delta_Build_Overview:MOST| MOST Delta RepRap]] or similar RepRap 3-D printer
#OpenScad or other Cad software http://www.openscad.org/

== Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the OSAT ==
* Basic knowledge of your 3-D printer and software used to make the model.Proficiency with a slicer program and some basic hand tool knowledge. 

== Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions==
#Download the files listed above 
#Prep your printer and load the .stl file and slice into a .gcode file
#Print cutter and clean any flash on the cutter slots
#Attach razor blade via the 2 M3 screw slots
* Print time
* 2hrs for simple cutter at 20% infill
* Assembly time will be the amount of time it takes to attach razor blade
* Approximately 2 minutes



=== Common Problems and Solutions===
The cutter slots may not print fully open and will need to be trimmed with a razor blade. Cutter slots may not also print with even opening spacing. 

== Cost savings==
Estimate your costs
Hand Cutter
* 29.58 grams of filament and approximately 120 minutes 
* $0.52 per cutter assuming filament costs of $20/Kg + whatever you value the time to set the print up at

Find a commercial equivalent
*No such thing exists
