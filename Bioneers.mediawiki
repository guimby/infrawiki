'''Bioneers''', also known as the '''Collective Heritage Institute''', is a New Mexico-based nonprofit organization promoting practical and innovative solutions to environmental and social problems based in a philosophy which recognizes the aliveness, interdependence, and intelligence of the natural world.  Bioneers holds an annual conference each October in San Rafael, California. Plenary sessions from the main conference are also broadcast through satellite feeds to "Beaming Bioneers" conferences held simultaneously at sites in various locations throughout the United States and Canada. Collective Heritage Institute/Bioneers was founded in 1990.

==Annual conference==

The first annual Bioneers Conference, organized by Kenny Ausubel and Nina Simons, took place in 1990.  Currently the conference takes place annually in San Rafael, California, on the third weekend in October. The conference highlights the work of scientific and social innovators and helps support, nurture and propagate their ideas and models. Conference speakers come from interdisciplinary fields: environmental and socio-political activism; "green" biology, chemistr], design, architecture and urban planning; organic and "beyond organic" farming and gardening;indigenous perspectives; biodiversity, [[bioremediation]], and wildland preservation; alternative energy; engaged spirituality, literature and the arts; holistic and "ecological" medicine; ethnobotany; socially-responsible]] entrepreneurship, business and philanthropy; the environmental justice, women's and youth movements; independent media; etc.

===Beaming Bioneers===

In 2002, Bioneers expanded with the addition of [http://beaming.bioneers.org/ simultaneous satellite conferences], called "Beaming Bioneers," which model themselves after the conference in San Rafael.
