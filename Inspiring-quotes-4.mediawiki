"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate (but) that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us. We ask ourselves, "who am I to be brilliant, talented, fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be? As we let our light shine, we give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence liberates others." Nelson Mandela, after Marianne Williamson

"Yet individual initiatives alone do not necessarily help to build strong, healthy communities (although they can free up time that could lead to greater [[community involvement]]), nor can they address the structural obstacles to genuine consumer choice  the lack of organic produce in the supermarket, for instance. Some critics even argue that, pursued in isolation, individual initiatives can be counterproductive. <br> <br>"An "individualization of responsibility", as political and environmental scientist Michael Maniates notes, distracts attention from the role that such institutions as business and government play in perpetuating unhealthy consumption. Moreover, to the extent that individuals see their power residing primarily in their pocketbooks, they may neglect their key roles as parents, educators, community members, and citizens in building a society of well-being."
