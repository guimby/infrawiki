==Equations==

;P=IV		
:Power=Current*Voltage 
:look familiar see [[:Category:Microhydro#Equation|P=Q*H*e/k]]

;V=IR		
:Volts=Current*Resistance
:I=V/R might be more edifying since current is usually the result of pressure acting on resistance.
:This only applies to [[wikipedia:Ohm's law|ohmic circuits]], those circuits which display a linear relationship between current and voltage (i.e. the resistance does not change based upon current or voltage).

==Analogies==
The following animated analogy illustrates the operation of direct current (DC) circuits.

For each example, ask yourself:
*How fast will the battery run out?
*How fast will the virgin margaritas be made?
*And most importantly why?

If you would like to do math to support these analogies, use:
*Feet = volts
*GPM = amps
*Each blender has a resistance of 6 Feet/GPM = 6 ohms

===1 Tank 1 Blender===
[[Image:Series 1T1B.gif]]

*This is the test case (datum).

===1 Tank 2 Series Blenders===
[[Image:Series 1T2B.gif]]

Notice that:
*The flow is 1/2 the speed of our test case.
*The two blenders in series are each going 1/4th the speed of our test case.

===1 Tank 2 Parallel Blenders===
[[Image:Parallel 1T2B.gif]]

Notice that:
*Each blender is at the same speed as our test case.
*The flow from the tank is twice as fast as our test case.

===2 Parallel Tanks 1 Blender===
[[Image:Parallel 2T1B.gif]]

Notice that:
*The blender is the same speed as our test case.
*The flow from each tank is half as fast as our test case.

===2 Series Tanks 1 Blender===
[[Image:Series 2T1B.gif]]

Notice that:
*The blender is 4 times the speed as our test case.
*The total flow is twice the speed as our test case.
*PS The second tank has a lid that keeps it closed.
