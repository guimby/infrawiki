== 3rd Editorial group meeting ==

=== Agenda ===

#Mario is developing 30 pages on 'The language of food'
#developing the book outline
#student/customer feedback
#progress review
#promoting the project more widely?
#date and venue for next meeting

== 2nd Editorial group meeting ==

Laurence, Danielle and Brett were unable to join us. Welcome to Mario! Mario has written extensively about food and confirmed that he could contribute material under a creative commons license. Confirmed that the group and the publication will concentrate on the postive aspects of local food. As the focus of Communigrow is increasingly on education it would be good if Mario could contribute something on this subject after more active involvement with Communigrow. 

In order that we can use a fair amount of illustration, once we've developed the text we can aim to produce up to 3 versions of the book:
1. mostly plain text but with some single tone illustrations
2. ebook with colour illustrations
3. possibly also a higher cost printed version with colour illustration and design work

Contributions from Five Acre Students: 3 students have already written a presentation. Richenda to find out if we can use this material, and material from future visits. Richenda also kindly offered to develop a feedback sheet for Communigrow customers. 

=== Agenda ===

#If Laurence can join us we might do a group interview
#Towards an outline for the book - ''see'' [[:category:365reasons]]
#design contribution sheets for a) Five Acre Students b) Communigrow customers
#If Communigrow successfully 'seeds' a local low carbon group: "Bradbourne LOWcarbon Community", it'd be useful to develop a section in the book something like: "Local food as part of a low carbon diet"
#progress review
#date and venue for next meeting
