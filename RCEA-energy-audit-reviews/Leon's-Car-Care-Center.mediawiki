=== Leon's Electrical Demand === 

Leon's Car Care Center (Figure 1) is a family owned and operated business that has been in [http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Eureka+CA&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=Eureka,+CA&gl=us&ei=KxgbS8DDDc7ZnAf9xaTRAw&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQ8gEwAA Eureka, California] for over 48 years.  Since 1992, Leon's Car Care Center has been located in a steel I-beam shop with an attached wood frame office, built new to their specifications.  The building was designed to decrease reliance on electric light by utilizing windows in the upper reaches of the structure, allowing natural light to penetrate to the main shop area. <br />
Lighting accounts for 20% to 50% of the energy consumed by a commercial building.<ref>Energy consumption.(n.d.) In Wikipedia.  Retrieved November, 2009. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting#Energy_consumption</ref> Automotive repair requires the use of power tools and computerized diagnostic equipment in addition to sufficient lighting. Power tools consume more operational current than lights, but are used sporadically, while lights are on continuously. The shop is also equipped with eight vehicle lifts and two air compressors that run most of the power tools. [[Image:MH.jpg|thumb|left|'''Figure 2.'''<br />Metal Halide fixtures replaced by Leon's.]]
The shop was originally illuminated using 32 400 watt [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_halide_lamp High Intensity Discharge] (HID) metal halide lamps (Figure 2).<ref>Farmtek. ValuTek 400W Metal Halide Bay Light. Retrieved November, 2009.

</ref> The metal halides were supplemented with wall mounted fluorescents for workbench lighting. The office  contains computers, fluorescent lighting, two climate control units, one cold soft drink vending machine, and a snack vending machine.<br /><br />

===Energy Miser===

The RCEA has overseen the installation of an energy miser (Figure 5) on the snack and cold drink vending machines in the office. The miser acts as a motion sensor in conjunction with a timer that shuts the appliances down after a period of inactivity. According to Austin, Texas based utility company [http://www.austinenergy.com/Energy%20Efficiency/Programs/Energy%20Miser/index.htm Austin Energy,] an energy miser has the potential to reduce the energy consumption of cold drink and snack vending machines by 40% and 80% respectively.

=='''Data Analysis'''==
[[Image:Leons power usage graph.jpg|thumb|right|700px|'''Figure 6.''' Leon's three year monthly kWh consumption data.]] 
[[Image:Leons_kwh_graph.png|thumb|right|650px|'''Figure 7.''' Pre and post retrofit electrical consumption.]]

=== Results ===

After the RCEA retrofit, electrical consumption dropped an average of '''252 kWh''' per month. This value exceeded the RCEA predicted savings of '''4.2 percent'''. Cost savings and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions have been calculated using the same monthly kWh value.
[[Image:Leons CO2 graph.jpg|thumb|right|650px|'''Figure 8.''' Comparing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions equivalents before and after the lighting retrofit.]]

Electrical consumption over a three year period was graphed (Figure 6) and labeled to indicate when the RCEA retrofits occured. Another graph (Figure 7) compares electrical data before and after the retrofit.  The ten-month periods of June 2008 to March 2009, and June 2007 to March 2008 are used as comparison periods before and after the retrofit (Figure 7). The sample time period was limited, due to the fact that ten months after the retrofit, Leon's performed their own lighting retrofit. The monthly averages are projected to one year for comparison to the RCEA yearly values.<br /><br />

=== Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Emissions ===

[[Image:Humco_elec_supply_chart.jpg|thumb|right|450px|'''Figure 9.''' Humboldt County's electrical energy source distribution.]]
The RCEA retrofit reduced carbon dioxide emissions at Leon's by 1,585 pounds per year. Kilowatt hours (kWh) can be equated to pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in relation to the various processes involved in the production of the electricity. Humboldt County's electricity comes from a number of sources (Figure 9).<ref name="howclean">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.(2009, February 19) ''How clean is the electricity I use?-Power Profiler ''. Retrieved December, 2009. http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/how-clean.html
</ref>  Pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> produced per kWh varies from source to source, e.g. electricity generated from burning coal produces an estimated 2.25 pounds per kWh<ref name="howclean"></ref>, all of this is associated with the actual emissions coming from the combustion.  PG&E reports that it generates 0.524 pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh produced. The kWh consumption by Leon's Car Care has been converted to pounds of CO<sub>2</sub> in Figure 8.<ref>PG&E.(n.d.)

=='''Future Retrofits'''==
Leon's is considering replacing one of their two piston-run air compressors with a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_screw_compressor Rotary Air Compressor]. This would decrease energy consumption in addition to decreasing shop noise and improving air pressure consistency among the pneumatic tools. The air compressors are the main source of energy for the power lifts used in the shop to raise vehicles for service and are run almost constantly.<br /><br />
General Manager Dale Warmuth is conscious of the impact that energy use has on his business. He is delighted at the savings his company sees in their efforts to improve efficiency both financially and ecologically. Mr. Warmuth has seen a 33% decrease in consumption since the retrofits including replacement of the metal halides. He is satisfied with the level of service received from the RCEA, and continues to pursue new and more efficient practices. <br><br>
