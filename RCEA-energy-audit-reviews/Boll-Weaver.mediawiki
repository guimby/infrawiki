=== About Boll Weaver  ===

[[Image:CDobbs.JPG|thumb|left|Figure 2:Crystal Dobbs showing off her yarn. (Picture taken by Holly Leopardi)]] Boll Weaver (Figure 1) is owned by Crystal Dobbs (Figure 2) and has been in Eureka, California for 15 years. Boll Weaver is a textiles center, offering classes and materials for felting, weaving, crocheting, knitting, dyeing and spinning looms.  The building is 1,400 square feet, with a storefront space where yarn and products are displayed, and a back room where classes are held. 
Most of the energy demand of the business comes from the ten lights in the store front, which are on an average of six hours a day, six days a week. The two classroom lights are used only when customers wish to see the looms or when classes are taking place. Boll Weaver also has a desktop computer, used to track orders and purchases, which also contributes to the business's energy consumption.<br>
[http://www.redwoodenergy.org Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA)] worked with Boll Weaver on a lighting retrofit to replace old ballasts and CFL light bulbs with new, energy efficient CLF light bulbs and ballast systems. This was part of a program that was throughout the community. As part of this program RCEA made projections for energy and money savings, and estimated how long it would take for the businesses to make a return on their investment in the retrofit. 
=== Technical Background <br>  ===

Definition of technical terms: 

*'''KWH:'''

This stands for kilowatt hours, which is a unit used to measure energy usage. 

*'''CO<sub>2</sub>:'''

Energy reduction can be referred to in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, as the majority of the energy used is produced from either coal or natural gas combustion, which produces CO<sub>2</sub><ref>Davis, Mackenzie L., and Susan J. Masten. Principles of Environmental Engineering and Science. 2nd ed. New York: Mcgraw Hill Higher Education, 2008. Print.</ref>.

A typical florescent bulb is between 3,000 and 5,000 K, where the True Color bulbs are around 6,000 K. The light from the sun on a clear, blue sky day is between 7,000 and 8,500 K. This gives the products illuminated by a True Color light bulb a more vibrant, "true" color. <ref>Tim Carter. (2009). Light Bulbs Alter True Colors . (n.d.).

== Lighting Retrofit  ==

RCEA worked with Boll Weaver to retrofit all ballasts and bulbs at the shop. In total, twenty four bulbs and twelve ballasts were replaced. The bulbs that were recommended by RCEA did not fit the needs of the business based on the color performance. Due to this, an independent lighting contractor was used. The bulbs were replaced with True Color light bulbs, which had the same efficiency as the light bulbs recommended by RCEA. The nature of the products that are sold in the store require a more vivid color spectrum which required these special bulbs to be used. These true color bulbs use 59 watts, which is a higher power consumption than the 32 watt bulbs that RCEA recommended.

== Outcome of the Retrofits  ==

The overall outcome of the retrofits resulted in some savings, however they were less than the RCEA predicted. The average monthly KWH usage for the year prior to the retrofit (10/2007-9/2008) was 308 KWH, which amounts to about 162 lbs of CO<sub>2</sub> produced per month (Table 1). The average monthly KWH usage the year following the retrofit (10/2008-9/2009) was 278 KWH, which amounts to about 146 lbs of CO<sub>2</sub> per month (Table 1). This was calculated by finding the average KWH usage from September 2007 to August 2008 and comparing it with the average KWH usage from September 2008 to August 2009. To find the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted, the average KWH use was multiplied by 0.5246lbsCO<sub>2</sub>/KWH. To find the monthly savings KWH was multiplied by the rate $0.16716/KWH. This is a yearly reduction of about 192 lbs of CO<sub>2</sub> (Table 2) or a 10% reduction in energy use. The actual yearly KWH reduction this far has been 28% of that predicted by RCEA. Part of this smaller energy reduction can be attributed to the higher wattage of bulbs used, compared to what RCEA based their estimates on.<br>

=== Clients Habits After the Retrofits  ===

The habits of the client did not change after the retrofit, most in part because Ms. Dobbs had preexisting habits that were energy conscious. One of the major reasons that Ms. Dobbs went through with the retrofit was because of environmental impact, which Ms. Dobbs has always been a strong advocate for.

=== Boll Weaver's Motivation to Go Forward With the Retrofits  ===

Ms. Dobbs went forward with the retrofit because she is an advocate of energy efficiency and needed to upgrade the lighting of the store, as the lighting was there since she opened her business 15 years ago. Ms. Dobbs did the retrofits for the idea of promoting energy efficiency more than for the money it would save. Ms. Dobbs would have liked to upgrade her lightning either way, but the push from RCEA made it a reality. 

There is no need for further retrofits in relation to the lighting at the Boll Weaver because all of the lights were replaced. 

=== Overall Experience With RCEA  ===

Ms. Dobbs said that she was happy with her overall experience with RCEA. They gave her the extra push she needed to get this project done. She said RCEA was very informative, polite and&nbsp; patient when it came to waiting for the independent contractor to finish the job. <br>
