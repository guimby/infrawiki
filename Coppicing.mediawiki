'''Coppicing''' is a traditional method of [[woodland management]], by which young tree stems are cut down to a low level, or sometimes right down to the ground. In subsequent growth years, many new [[shoot|shoots]] will grow up, and after a number of years the cycle begins again and the coppiced tree or '''stool''' is ready to be harvested again. Typically a coppice woodland is harvested in sections, on a rotation. In this way each year a crop is available. This also has the side-effect of providing a rich variety of habitats, as the woodland always has a range of different aged stools growing in it. This is beneficial for [[biodiversity]].

The cycle length depends upon the species cut, the local custom, and the use to which the product is put. [[Birch]] can be coppiced for [[Faggot (unit of measurement)|faggots]] on a 3 or 4 year cycle, whereas [[oak]] can be coppiced over a 50-year cycle for poles or firewood. 

The shoots (or "suckers") may be used either in their young state for
interweaving in [[wattle fencing]] as is the practice with [[willow|willows]],
or the new shoots may be allowed to grow and mature into large poles, as was often the custom with hardwood such as oaks or [[ash (tree)|ashes]]. This practice creates long, straight poles which are better for working than naturally grown trees which have bends and forks. Coppicing may also be practiced to encourage specific growth patterns, as with [[cinnamon]] trees which are grown for their bark.

==Current practice==
In Europe coppiced hardwoods were extensively used in shipbuilding (wooden ships) or carriage building, and are now still grown, albeit in very small amounts, for making wooden buildings and furniture.

In Southern [[Britain]], coppice was traditionally [[hazel]], grown amongst [[oak]] standards (large trees). This provided wood for many purposes, especially [[charcoal]] which before the availability of [[coal]] was economically significant in allowing [[smelting]] of metals. A minority of these woods are still operated for coppice today, often by [[Conservation in the United Kingdom|conservation organisations]], producing material for [[hurdle]]-making, [[thatching]] spars, local charcoal-burning or other crafts. The only remaining large-scale commercial coppice crop in the area is [[sweet chestnut]] which is grown in parts of [[East Sussex]] and [[Kent]] for splitting and binding into cleft chestnut paling [[fence]] bound together with wire.
