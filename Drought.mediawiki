{{topic header| default.png |Drought}}

'''Drought''' is when a landscape does not receive enough [[fresh water]] (from [[rain]], [[ice melt]], or other sources). [[Water conservation]] is needed before and during a drought. 

Droughts have severe economic, health, and social effects due to disruption of [[crops|crop]] / [[food production]], [[drinking water]] supply, and other uses of water. Loss of plant/vegetation cover from droughts also contributes to [[soil erosion]] from wind and from water when rain does occur.

Over the past few decades, drought has contributed to widespread [[famine]], social disruption, and warfare in many developing countries, especially in [[Africa]]. 

Most researchers expect droughts to become more common over the coming decades due to [[global climate change]]. 

Long-term drought leads to [[desertification]].  

Effects of drought can be mitigated in various ways:

*Planting of [[drought-resistant crops]]
*Avoidance of water-intensive lifestyles (e.g., preferring "[[xeriscaping]]"{{w|Xeriscaping}} [[landscaping]] over [[grass]] [[lawn]]s)
*Use of low-water appliances (e.g. low-flush toilets, low-flow shower heads)
*Avoiding erosion by contouring land; planting drought-resistant [[trees]], [[bushes]], or [[ground cover]] plants to stabilize [[soil]]; use of artificial or planted [[windbreak]]s. 
*Recycling water through [[greywater]] systems.

==2007 drought in Tennessee, USA==
As of 2007 Orme, Tennessee was one of the hardest-hit communities in the drought-ridden southeastern United States, due to its dependence on two vulnerable water sources: a waterfall-fed creek and a natural spring that delivered up to 60,000 gallons/day (227,000 liters/day).  These sources dried up to only 5,000 gallons/day (19,000 liters/day), not enough to pressurize the supply lines to the town's residents.

A temporary solution was arranged inwhich a 1961 [[firetruck]][http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/tech/2007/11/07/dornin.dry.town.cnn] hauls water to the town from Alabama providing enough water to keep the system running for only three hours each day, from 18:00 to 21:00 local time.<ref name="AP">Associated Press (2007-11-01).

The mayor of Orme, Tony Reames, arranged a permanent solution in the form of a connection to the municipal system of the nearby community of [[Bridgeport, Alabama]].  In his words:  "It's not a short-term solution.  It is THE solution."  The connection would be via a 2.5 mile (4 km) pipe between the two communities, paid for by an emergency grant of $377,590 from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. The project was hoped to be completed by the end of [[November]] [[2007]]. <ref name="Bluestein">Bluestein, Greg (2007-11-01).  Tennessee town has run out of water. ''Charlotte Observer''.
