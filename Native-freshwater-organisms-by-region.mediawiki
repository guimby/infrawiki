== Why native organisms ? ==
Native organisms can be expected to fit the [[ecology]] of the region, and be able to grow in the [[climate]] and [[soil]] of the region. They can also play an important role in reducing the [[Food distribution|distance food needs to travel]]. However, native organisms may not always be as productive as the more popular domesticated counterparts or attain equally high prices. The latter is often a result of being not well known (and thus disliked) by the population (at least at first). 

Native organisms should always be considered in [[aquaculture]] as they are generally hardier and thus [[food security|safer organisms]] in terms of providing food (especially today, with global warming affecting the environment). They are however not the most appropriate choice in some situations. As most freshwater species will be cultivated in secluded environments (ie ponds, tanks/basins) and as contact to the outside environment thus be reduced/eliminated non-indigenous organisms may be a suitable option as well however.

Note that although the amount of freshwater organisms is much greater than what is mentioned in the list, we only specify species here that are usable for [[aquaculture]]. Most types of organisms can not be kept in captivity (ie they may have very specific needs, are very susceptible to stress/disease, oxygen fluctuations in the water, water quality, ..)

Also note that on the map below, the amount of plankton per region is marked. Although many organisms grown in aquaculture do not/can not consume plankton, it is often still possible to use the locally available plankton to feed the organisms we grow. This, by also growing another organism (that can be fed on plankton) and use this as food for the organisms we grow. We can btw also process waste (ie feces) of organisms we grow and use this to grow hydrophytes as food for other organisms. These methods allow far more cost-efficient production, and also decrease pressure on the environment. See [[Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture]].

==Types of native organisms by region==
[[File:Indigenous marine organisms.png|thumb|upright=2|center|Indigenous fish, shellfish and hydrophytes map.]]
===Type of organisms indicated in this article===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|Fish: abbreviation F_ followed by a number to indicate the region. Also includes fish grown for roe
|-
|Shellfish: abbreviation SF_ followed by a number to indicate the region. Shellfish includes crustaceans and molluscs
|-
|Hydrophytes: abbreviation H_ followed by a number to indicate the region. These crops are either coastal crops (so growing on land, but capable of being flooded or sprayed with freshwater or brakish water (in estuaries), ie Salicornia {{W|Salicornia}} ), floating plants (which live in deeper water yet which head their flower heads come above water and also still have their roots in the ground, ie Nuphar lutea {{W|Nuphar lutea}}),  submerged (rooted) plants (which are entirely submerged yet are rooted in soil, ...; ie most seaweed), or submerged (not-rooted) plants (which are entirely submerged and are not rooted in soil, ... ; ie most algae)

==Regions==
For a map showing the location of the oceans and seas, see [http://ephotopix.com/image/world/world_ocean_sea_map.gif here] Note that although we divide the map using the oceans, the marine species are not grown in these oceans but rather in the rivers on the land, and near the sea (estuaries). Some fish mentioned here are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadromous#Classification catadromous] or amphidromous.

==Notes==
* Freshwater eels (such as European eel, New Zealand Longfin eel, Japanese eel, ...) have not been included as they are not yet bred in captivity, and as a result are now in danger of becoming extinct. They can be included later-on, once the breeding issue has been resolved. 
* Certain submerged plants can also provide extra oxygen to the water, allowing (certain) fish to survive if planted in the area, even if the water had low amounts of in oxygen; see [[Treatment_ponds]].
* In certain situations, it is possible to place seaweed and/or other estuary farms in such a way that it obstructs areas behind the farm, preventing fishing at that location. This method could allow the creation of places where (the still young) fish can hide, a bit similar to mangroves. Off course, fishing should then also not be exerciced by the owner of the estuary farm.
