<center>''Photovoltaic solar system made with mono-crystalline cells.''</center>

== Design ==
I have been working on a photovoltaic solar system for a couple of weeks now, and this is where I am at.  I bought my solar cells from ebay, and I bought some of the supplies needed from amazon. Once I received the supplies I soldered the cells together using some solder and the tabbing wire, with the soldering iron.  I then soldered all the cells to form rows and laid them out ready to be put into a case.  This system should put out around 120 watts, or around 18 volts. 

Materials:
*Solar Cells (from ebay)
*Tabbing Wire (amazon)
*Bus Wire (amazon)
*Diodes (amazon)
*Flux Pen (amazon)
*Soldering Iron (hardware store)
*Solder (hardware store)

=== Next Steps ===
As of now the solar system does not have a mount.  The mount will also take some time and money, and I will eventually upload a picture of the system mounted.  The materials I still need to create the mount are:
*2x4 for the outer shell/design
*Glass to place inside the wood frame
*Resin to pour and harden over the cells when they are laid upon the glass.
*Waterproof Paint to paint the wood, and make sure it will not deteriorate.

Finally once I have it mounted I will need to acquire an 18 volt battery, and an inverter to change the current from DC to AC so the solar system can charge the battery.

== '''Project Goals''' ==
Eventually I would like this solar system to be used to power electronics in my camper van.
