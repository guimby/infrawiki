The [[solar photovoltaic]] industry in Ontario and around the world is growing at an unprecedented rate, creating the jobs that underpin a [[green economy]] and a sustainable power grid. With this growth came an increased demand from industry for high-quality research in solar systems design and optimization in realistic (and sometimes extreme) Canadian outdoor environments. To answer this need, a partnership has formed the [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] (OSOTF). The OSOTF was originally developed with a strong partnership between the [[QAS|Applied Sustainability Research Group]] run by Dr. [[User:J.M.Pearce|Joshua Pearce]] at Queen’s University (now at [[:category:MOST|Michigan Tech]]) and the [[Sustainable Energy Applied Research Centre]] (SEARC) at St. Lawrence College headed by Adegboyega (Babs) Babasola.[[Image:DSCF2427.JPG|thumb|Rob Andrews and Adegboyega Babasola amongst panels at the OSOTF]]
This collaboration has grown rapidly to include multiple industry partners and the OSOTF has been redesigned to provide critical data and research for the team.

The OSOTF is a fully grid-connected test system, which continuously monitors the output of 95 photovoltaic modules and correlates their performance to a long list of highly accurate meteorological readings. The teamwork has resulted in one of the largest systems in the world for this detailed level of analysis, and can provide valuable information on the actual performance of photovoltaic modules in real-world conditions. Unlike many other photovoltaic projects, the OSOTF is organized under [[open source]] principles as open-source design can be utilized to catalyze rapid innovation in the PV industry.<ref> A. J.

The first project for the OSOTF forms [[User:R.Andrews|Rob Andrews]]' graduate thesis at Queen's, which quantifies the losses due to snowfall of a solar photovoltaic system, generalizes these losses to any location with weather data and recommends best practices for system design in snowy climates. The results of this study will be available at the end of the summer.  Future projects at the OSOTF will investigate novel systems layouts, low-level concentration, and the effects of spectral composition on solar cell performance.  In addition the system will be used for technology and module comparisons and validations, as well as multiple specialized research programs going into the future.

The development of this cutting edge test facility is a testament to the commitment of the photovoltaic industry to continuous innovation, and will be a valuable tool for ensuring the development of a sustainable power system worldwide. 

== Open Solar Outdoors Test Field ==
The [[SEARC]] [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] consists of two discreet test beds, the largest of which is located on the roof of the new Wind Turbine and Trades building at St.Lawrence College and which has room for 60 commercial PV panels, which are divided between eight angles of  5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 degrees.  [[Image:SEARC_OTF.jpg|thumb|Overview of OSOTF at SEARC as of January 2011]] Live video for the test field is openly available [http://snowstudy.ati.sl.on.ca/ online]. Full data access available [http://www.searckingston.ca/osotf.php  here].

The second test field is located on a flat rooftop at St.Lawrence College and consists of two commercial flat roof ballasted systems. Live video of this test field is also available [http://snowstudyballast.ati.sl.on.ca online]

In addition the  [[Queen's Innovation Park Test Site]] which was developed as part of a preliminary study on the effects of snow on photovoltaic performance funded by [http://www.sustainableenergy.com/ Sustainable Energy Technologies]. It consists of 16 panels mounted at angles from 0 to 70 degrees, with two each at increments of 10 degrees. [[Image:Snow Study38564.JPG|thumb|Representative image of Queen's Innovation Park test site]] By monitoring panel output, solar influx, snow fall and meteorological factors a loss due to snowfall can be determined for a general system at a variety of angles. In addition, thermal panel measurements lead to a better understanding of snow shedding mechanisms. A series of analysis algorithms have been developed which allow for constant data mining to determine factors such as snow coverage ratio using image analysis, performance ratio, and estimated losses/gains due to snowfall. A detailed description of the sensors and measurements used in the study can be seen below.

== Specifications ==
The [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] is designed to be a state-of-the-art outdoors test facility which makes this site one of the premier PV test beds in North America.The capabilities of this test bed are shown in the following table.

=Applications and Research Questions=

The data collected from this apparatus will assist in determining the following parameters, which are essential to a proper PV system design
* What is the effect of snow on PV system performance? Answer See: [[Effects of snow on photovoltaic performance]]
* How can you use  fine resolution modelling of PV systems to optimize system design, improve reliability of projected outputs to ensure favourable project financing and to facilitate proper operations and maintenance? Answer See: [[Parametric empirical determination of PV short circuit current‎]]
* How does cell shading in mono and poly crystalline silicon-based panels effect snow related losses?
* How does the spectral nature of diffuse and reflected light effect thin-film technologies?
* How does albedo effect PV performance and what is the best way to take advantage of these effects?
* What effect does the mounting arrangement have on losses? A low profile ballasted or a residential roof mount system provide additional obstacles to clearing, and may significantly increase snow related losses
* What other technologies and methods are available to clear the snow from a covered array, and are these economically viable when compared to the snow related losses of the system?
* How does uneven snow melt effect a string of modules? Are there possible improvements to string wiring or inverter performance which can better handle the uneven loads during snow shedding?
* What effect does the usage of hydrophobic and hydrophilic coatings have on PV losses? Answer See: [[A new method to determine the effects of hydrodynamic surface coatings on the snow shedding effectiveness of solar photovoltaic modules]]

=Expansion=

In addition, though the first application of OSOTF is to monitor the effects of snowfall on PV systems, this testing apparatus will be used in the future to perform technology comparisons and to expand knowledge in the field of practical PV system installation. We are always interested in expanding our base of research and if you are interested in collaboration, please contact [[User:J.M.Pearce|Prof. Joshua Pearce]] or [[SEARC]].
