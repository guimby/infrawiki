Indicator frameworks are measures that allow assessing how well some system of interest is performing, usually with the intent of improving that performance towards a desired goal.

In terms of sustainability, indicators can help measure important aspects of environmental impact or contribution at the individual, household, organisational, or regional, national, or international level.

== Levels of Indicators ==

At the national level, they are potentially an important adjunct alternative to the [[wikipedia:Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), which is criticised for only measuring the level of a countries' economic activity, good or bad, and thus not being useful to measure progress towards [[Sustainable well-being]].

Computer information systems are often helpful for communicating and allowing interaction with a set of indicators. For example, a [[GIS]] system could be used to support understanding environmental and other indicators at the city or regional-level.
