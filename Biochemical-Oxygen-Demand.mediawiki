'''Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)''' is a [[water quality]] parameter that measures the amount of oxygen required for biochemical activity (e.g. aerobic bacteria) to break down all organic material present in the water. High levels of BOD in a system can decrease the available oxygen and be harmful to aquatic life.<ref name = MandE>Metcalf and Eddy, 2003, Wastewater Engineering Treatment and Reuse, McGraw Hill, New York, NY</ref>
