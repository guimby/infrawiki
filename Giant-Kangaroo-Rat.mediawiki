''Dipodomys ingens'', a species listed as endangered and of current concern due to the California Valley Solar Ranch project proposal in San Luis Obispo County California. 

==Possible adaptation to invasives==

A search of the literature (McNeely 2004) suggests the concern that the GKR may
be adapted to invasive or non-native species, ie. red brome (Bromus
rubens)Apparently, the seeds of the RB are larger than other seeds in the area,
which makes them more attractive to the GKR.<ref>Public comment of Upland Research Science Action|Geof Bard - Policy Analyst|http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UplandResearchScienceAction/message/1135</ref>

A policy problem is thus: would it be preferable to establish new mitigation reserves with no Red brune,
forcing the animals to re-adapt to their original preferred native foods? Would
they accept that, or would they attempt to migrate back into areas where they
could find the now-favored Red Brune? <ref>URSA CVSR</ref>
