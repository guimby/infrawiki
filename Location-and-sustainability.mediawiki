Efforts to map [[sustainability]] by location include [[Enabling Innovation]] (a project proposal).

[[Appropedia]] (and any well structured [[wiki]]) does this through the use of location categories ([[:Category:Locations]] and its subcategories). However, enhancements will be needed if relative location is to be used, e.g. through [[GIS]]. Integration with a map tool (e.g. [[OpenStreetMap]] or [[Google Maps]]) may enable this, though it is currently unclear how this could work without intensive manual effort.
